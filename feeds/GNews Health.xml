Clalit said relatively few people report COVID illness to community doctors, but it noted a rise in hospitalizations. Meuhedet reported a 10% increase in patients from August to September and a nearly threefold jump from July to September.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="3b8po" data-offset-key="46klp-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.ryl3kHjy6ex" id="image_ArticleImageData.ryl3kHjy6ex"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.ryl3kHjy6ex" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2023/09/06/ByDftiSRn/ByDftiSRn_0_73_1000_563_0_x-large.jpg" alt="בדיקת קורונה" title="Coronavirus test (Photo: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.ryl3kHjy6ex" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2023/09/06/ByDftiSRn/ByDftiSRn_0_73_1000_563_0_x-large.jpg" alt="בדיקת קורונה" title="Coronavirus test (Photo: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Coronavirus test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3b8po" data-offset-key="7k4tl-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7k4tl-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7k4tl-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The Health Ministry said there has been a moderation in the increase in COVID hospitalizations. “According to data received from 15 general hospitals, as of mid-September there was about a 10% rise compared with mid-August, versus a 40% rise in the previous month,” the ministry said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3b8po" data-offset-key="61oai-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="61oai-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="61oai-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“We’ve seen a slightly more significant wave of COVID-19 over the past three months, and we are now in the midst of that wave,” said Professor Tal Brosh, head of infectious diseases at the Assuta Ashdod public hospital and head of the Health Ministry’s epidemic response team. He sought to reassure the public: “These are not the huge waves we saw in 2021-22 when hundreds of thousands of Israelis were infected one after another and hospital wards filled. Since the start of COVID there has always been ongoing illness, sometimes a bit more and sometimes a bit less. It comes in waves, and most of the time it simply doesn’t interest the public.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3b8po" data-offset-key="nti8-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="nti8-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="nti8-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;He said the current rise is seen mainly among hospitalized patients, most of them older people with underlying illnesses. “We almost never see hospitalized COVID patients who do not have underlying conditions, and certainly we do not see young people hospitalized with COVID as we did before vaccines, when people in their 40s and 50s were hospitalized with severe COVID,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3b8po" data-offset-key="7l5mk-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7l5mk-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7l5mk-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Still, he said, deaths are occurring among older people and other at-risk groups. Brosh noted that in 2024 COVID caused more illness and deaths than any other respiratory virus, including influenza. “It’s important to remember that COVID is not a seasonal disease, meaning infections occur throughout the year,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="3b8po" data-offset-key="afn77-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta wrapped"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleWrappedImageComponenta"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleWrappedImageData.B1xcXrsk6gx" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/08/07/SyLVf11GOxg/SyLVf11GOxg_225_44_544_725_0_medium.jpg" alt="פרופ' טל ברוש" title="Professor Tal Brosh&amp;amp;nbsp; (Photo: Private album) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="caption" contenteditable="false"&gt;Professor Tal Brosh &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span disabled class="credit" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Private album&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3b8po" data-offset-key="acflt-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="acflt-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="acflt-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;According to the National Center for Disease Control report for the week ending September 27, the number and percentage of positive COVID samples among hospitalized patients remain high compared with most of the past year. That week reported 92 new cases, about 8.3% of all hospitalized patients in 11 monitored hospitals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3b8po" data-offset-key="4482u-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4482u-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4482u-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The prominent variants in the current wave are Nimbus (NB.1.8.1) and Stratus (XFG), from the JN.1 lineage, which are also seen globally and have become dominant. Dr. Efrat Wexler, head of primary care at Meuhedet, said the variants appear more transmissible but there is no evidence they are more aggressive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3b8po" data-offset-key="77ruc-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="77ruc-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="77ruc-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“We hear from some patients that the illness is worse compared with previous infections, with marked weakness or increased mucus production, cough and runny nose, but we have not found that the current strains produce symptoms unusual beyond what we have known so far — high fever, dry or productive cough, fatigue and weakness, muscle and throat pain, and nasal congestion,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3b8po" data-offset-key="6lu9r-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6lu9r-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6lu9r-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Brosh said new variants continue to evolve while immunity wanes over time. He noted that most young people were vaccinated with three doses about four years ago. “In those years they may not have encountered the virus, meaning they did not develop infection-derived immunity, and therefore they experience more significant illness.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3b8po" data-offset-key="6t6n2-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6t6n2-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6t6n2-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Against the backdrop of rising cases, Brosh also pointed to falling COVID vaccination rates in recent years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3b8po" data-offset-key="38qlc-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="38qlc-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="38qlc-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt; “If in 2020-21 Israel was a model for the world and we carried out the fastest, most comprehensive vaccination campaign, in the past year our figures are among the worst in Western countries,” he said. “Last year fewer than 50,000 Israelis were vaccinated, compared with 60%-70% of adults vaccinated in Scandinavia, and even in the United States, despite strong vaccine hesitancy, about 40% of at-risk people were vaccinated, whereas in Israel the figure is almost zero.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3b8po" data-offset-key="bl1m4-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bl1m4-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bl1m4-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;He said the main reason for low vaccination uptake is a lack of public awareness and guidance. “We did a very poor job in the past two years. The Health Ministry and the health funds failed in outreach to at-risk groups about the need to get a COVID vaccine each year, similar to influenza. So even people who see the value in vaccines are not getting vaccinated because they don’t even know they should,” according to Brosh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="3b8po" data-offset-key="76e2q-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3b8po" data-offset-key="d2nbd-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="d2nbd-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="d2nbd-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;He also blamed rising anti-vaccine sentiment — a growing phenomenon in Israel and worldwide, especially regarding COVID vaccines. “During the pandemic many felt the vaccine was imposed on them, and at the same time a lot of misinformation against vaccines spread. I’m convinced that even if we run a very good campaign now, many people will still be afraid to vaccinate, and we must act on this,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3b8po" data-offset-key="39fd-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="39fd-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="39fd-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Under updated Health Ministry guidance, COVID vaccination is recommended for people 65 and older and for those 6 months to 64 years who belong to risk groups: people with chronic illnesses including kidney disease, chronic lung disease and heart disease; smokers; and residents of geriatric institutions, nursing homes and assisted living.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="3b8po" data-offset-key="d6tsi-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="d6tsi-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="d6tsi-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Brosh said the updated recommendations align with other countries such as Britain, the United States and the Nordic countries. For people 65 and older who live in geriatric institutions, nursing homes or assisted living, an additional vaccine dose is recommended after six months — effectively two doses a year. Two doses a year are also recommended for people 75 and older regardless of health status.

Researchers found that it’s not just the amount of belly fat that matters, but how metabolically active that fat is. In other words, visceral fat that’s “burning up” more glucose (sugar) for energy may drive cancer growth and make the disease more aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery has major implications for women’s health across the globe as rates of obesity and endometrial cancer continue to rise. The findings could change how doctors assess cancer risk in women and open doors for new diagnostic and treatment approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the study found&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, led by scientists from Haukeland University Hospital and the University of Bergen, analyzed PET/CT scans from 274 women diagnosed with endometrial cancer—a cancer that affects the lining of the uterus. Using advanced imaging, the team measured how much glucose each woman’s visceral fat was using, an indicator of how “metabolically active” the fat tissue was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women whose visceral fat showed higher glucose uptake tended to have:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;More advanced endometrial cancer at diagnosis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greater likelihood of lymph node involvement, a sign of aggressive disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the total volume of visceral fat didn’t always match its metabolic activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that simply having more belly fat wasn’t necessarily the problem, what really mattered was how “hot” or inflamed that fat was on a molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why metabolically active visceral fat is dangerous&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visceral fat is the deeper, more harmful kind of fat that surrounds your liver, intestines, and other organs. Unlike subcutaneous fat (the softer fat under your skin), visceral fat produces inflammatory chemicals and hormones that can disrupt metabolism and fuel chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how metabolically active visceral fat may worsen endometrial cancer outcomes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic Inflammation: Active visceral fat releases cytokines and fatty acids, which create an inflammatory environment that helps tumors grow and spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insulin resistance: Inflammation promotes insulin resistance, which in turn fuels cancer cell growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adipokine signaling: Fat cells send signals called adipokines that can “talk” directly to tumor cells, helping them survive and invade nearby tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This “crosstalk” between fat tissue and cancer cells could explain why women with highly active visceral fat experience more aggressive and harder-to-treat cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for women’s health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, obesity has been a known risk factor for endometrial cancer, especially among postmenopausal women. But this new study suggests that not all fat is equal, and it’s the behavior of visceral fat that may determine cancer severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight a potential new frontier in cancer research: targeting metabolically active belly fat to reduce cancer aggressiveness. If doctors can develop imaging tools or drugs to calm down or neutralize “hot” visceral fat, it could become a breakthrough in personalized cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2025 01:14:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>斐济的HIV病例因蓝斑、化疗和共用针头而激增--英国广播公司</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m42dwvlk8o</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 jRDKjj"&gt;'They're not just sharing needles, they're sharing blood': How HIV cases soared in Fiji&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kSquvq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/11fb/live/1d4988b0-9f6f-11f0-99d3-79886bca9dc5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/11fb/live/1d4988b0-9f6f-11f0-99d3-79886bca9dc5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/11fb/live/1d4988b0-9f6f-11f0-99d3-79886bca9dc5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/11fb/live/1d4988b0-9f6f-11f0-99d3-79886bca9dc5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/11fb/live/1d4988b0-9f6f-11f0-99d3-79886bca9dc5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/11fb/live/1d4988b0-9f6f-11f0-99d3-79886bca9dc5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/11fb/live/1d4988b0-9f6f-11f0-99d3-79886bca9dc5.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/11fb/live/1d4988b0-9f6f-11f0-99d3-79886bca9dc5.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images Three syringes, seemingly used, lying on a tattered orange blanket" class="sc-5340b511-0 bGQwLJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 lha-dta"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Intravenous drug use is fuelling Fiji's HIV epidemic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Ten: that's the age of the youngest person with HIV that Sesenieli Naitala has ever met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;When she first started Fiji's Survivor Advocacy Network in 2013, that young boy was yet to be born.

Several pointed out that, as awareness around HIV spreads and stigma diminishes, more people have been coming forward and getting tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;At the same time though, they also noted that countless more remain invisible to the official figures – and that the true scale of the issue is likely much bigger than even the record-breaking numbers suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;'Sharing the blood'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Underpinning Fiji's HIV epidemic is a spiralling trend of drug use, unsafe sex, needle sharing and "bluetoothing". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Otherwise known as "hotspotting", this latter term refers to a practice where an intravenous drug user withdraws their blood after a hit and injects it into a second person – who may then do the same for a third, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Kalesi Volatabu, executive director for the NGO Drug Free Fiji, has seen it happen firsthand. Last May, she was on one of her regular early morning walks through the Fijian capital of Suva, offering support and education to drug users on the streets, when she turned a corner and saw a group of seven or eight people huddling together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I saw the needle with the blood – it was right there in front of me," she recalls. "This young woman, she'd already had the shot and she's taking out the blood – and then you've got other girls, other adults, already lining up to be hit with this thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It's not just needles they're sharing – they're sharing the blood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Bluetoothing has also been reported in South Africa and Lesotho, two countries with some of the world's highest rates of HIV. In Fiji, the practice became popular within the past few years, according to both Ms Volatabu and Ms Naitala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/de66/live/54020880-a007-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/de66/live/54020880-a007-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/de66/live/54020880-a007-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/de66/live/54020880-a007-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/de66/live/54020880-a007-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/de66/live/54020880-a007-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/de66/live/54020880-a007-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/de66/live/54020880-a007-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Supplied: Kalesi Volatabu A woman in a black and turquoise dress, wearing glasses and speaking into a microphone in front of several onlookers.

Another is the convenience of only needing one syringe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;These can be difficult to come by in Fiji, where pharmacies, under police pressure, often demand prescriptions for syringes, and there is a lack of needle-syringe programmes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Although there is growing acceptance and approval for the rollout of such programmes – which provide clean injecting equipment to drug users in an attempt to reduce the transmission of blood-borne infections like HIV – implementation in the highly religious and conservative country has proven challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Ms Volatabu says there is a "drastic shortage" of needle-syringe sites, which is fuelling dangerous practices like needle-sharing and bluetoothing and putting the onus on NGOs to distribute syringes as well as condoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In August 2024, Fiji's Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MOH) recognised bluetoothing as one of the drivers for the country's rise in HIV cases. Another was chemsex, where people use drugs - often methamphetamine - before and during sexual encounters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In Fiji, unlike most other countries around the world, crystal meth is predominantly consumed via intravenous injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;MOH also found that of the 1,093 new cases recorded in the first nine months of 2024, 223 – about 20% – were from intravenous drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;Kids on meth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Fiji has become a major Pacific trafficking hub for crystal meth over the past 15 years. A large part of this is due to the country's geographic location between East Asia and the Americas – some of the world's biggest manufacturers of the drug - and Australia and New Zealand – the world's highest-paying markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;During that same period, meth has spilled into and spread throughout local communities, developing into a crisis that, like HIV, was recently declared a "national emergency". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;And according to those on the frontlines, the age of users is trending downwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We see more and more of these young people," says Ms Volatabu. "They are getting younger and younger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Fiji's most recent national HIV statistics cite injectable drug use as the most common known mode of transmission, accounting for 48% of cases. Sexual transmission accounted for 47% of cases, while mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy and childbirth was cited as the cause of most paediatric cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Everyone the BBC spoke to agreed that lack of education is a central factor in the epidemic. Ms Volatabu and Ms Naitala are both working to change that – and Ms Naitala says that as a greater awareness around the dangers of HIV spreads throughout the community, "bluetoothing" has, in her experience, fallen out of favour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;More people are getting tested and seeking treatment for HIV, leading to more robust data around the scale of the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But there is still a worry that the official case numbers are merely the tip of the iceberg – and a fear of what may lie beneath the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;The avalanche&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;José Sousa-Santos, head of the Pacific Regional Security Hub at New Zealand's University of Canterbury, says "a perfect storm is brewing".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"The concern is across all levels of society and government in regards to Fiji's HIV crisis – not just what's happening at the moment, but where it's going to be in three years' time and the lack of Fiji's resources," he tells the BBC. "The support systems - the nursing, the ability to distribute or to access the drugs for treatment of HIV - just aren't there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"That's what terrifies us, the people that work in the region: there is no way that Fiji can deal with this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/18f8/live/83b21860-9ffb-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/18f8/live/83b21860-9ffb-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/18f8/live/83b21860-9ffb-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/18f8/live/83b21860-9ffb-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/18f8/live/83b21860-9ffb-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/18f8/live/83b21860-9ffb-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/18f8/live/83b21860-9ffb-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/18f8/live/83b21860-9ffb-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Supplied: José Sousa-Santos A man with a goatee wearing a blue suit and blue shirt" class="sc-5340b511-0 bGQwLJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 lha-dta"&gt;Supplied: José Sousa-Santos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;José Sousa-Santos has been ringing the alarm bell on Fiji's HIV epidemic for years&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Following its declaration of an outbreak in January, the Fijian government has sought to improve its HIV surveillance and enhance its ability to address the likely underreporting of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The Global Alert and Response Network, which was called upon to provide that support, stated in a recent report that "addressing these pressing issues through a well-coordinated national response is crucial in reversing the trajectory of the HIV epidemic in Fiji".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;That report also noted that staffing shortages, communication issues, challenges with lab equipment and stockouts of HIV rapid tests and medicines were impacting screening, diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Data collection is slow, difficult and error-prone, it added – hampering efforts to understand the extent of Fiji's HIV epidemic and the efficacy of the outbreak response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;That leaves many experts, authorities and everyday Fijians in the dark.

But when thousands of students arrive on campus they bring with them a cocktail of respiratory viruses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Add packed lecture theatres, dirty shared kitchens and late-night parties, and the result is a wave of illness that spreads quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Sheena Cruickshank, an immunologist and professor in biomedical sciences at the University of Manchester, describes it as a "mixing pot" of infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"You're bringing people together from all over the world, putting them in close quarters, and exposing them to viruses they've never encountered before," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Respiratory viruses are constantly evolving and even small differences between variants can mean the body's immune system doesn't recognise them, forcing it to start from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;The role of drinking, diet and stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 geRyoc"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/232f/live/13b14560-a0a8-11f0-93bc-5f62999beb00.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/232f/live/13b14560-a0a8-11f0-93bc-5f62999beb00.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/232f/live/13b14560-a0a8-11f0-93bc-5f62999beb00.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/232f/live/13b14560-a0a8-11f0-93bc-5f62999beb00.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/232f/live/13b14560-a0a8-11f0-93bc-5f62999beb00.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/232f/live/13b14560-a0a8-11f0-93bc-5f62999beb00.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/232f/live/13b14560-a0a8-11f0-93bc-5f62999beb00.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/232f/live/13b14560-a0a8-11f0-93bc-5f62999beb00.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A young woman and a man smile as a large number of arms holding pint glasses of lager or beer are held above their heads, as if they are saying cheers" class="sc-5340b511-0 bGQwLJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 lha-dta"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The immune system is the body's natural defence against infections. It's made up of a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to detect harmful invaders like viruses and bacteria, and help the body fight them off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But during freshers' week your immune system is under-resourced and overworked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;That's because, as Prof Cruickshank explains, "your diet, your level of activity, your level of stress, and sleep are all factors that affect immune functions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Which, she recognises, are "not necessarily the first focus" for students in the early weeks of university.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Among these, stress plays a particularly disruptive role. The pressure to settle in, make friends, manage new responsibilities, and keep up with academic demands can quickly become overwhelming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;This triggers the release of cortisol, a stress hormone that suppresses immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We've all had those times when you're super stressed, you've got loads of deadlines, you work, work, work, you finish all the deadlines - and then you get ill," says Prof Cruickshank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Stress can also impact the amount of sleep you get, which also impacts the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But for many students, the pressure to socialise and make friends during freshers' week outweighs the need to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 etSgSK"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 jFVvLh"&gt;Imogen says freshers' flu lingers for quite a while&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I didn't want to miss out," says Imogen Farmer, 19, a second-year student at the University of Leeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;She says she met up with friends every evening during freshers' week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"I definitely suffered with it after the first week, like sore throat, runny nose, those typical symptoms, and it does linger for quite a while."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Imogen says it's been worth it because "so much of student culture, especially during freshers' week, revolves around nights out".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"That is how you meet a lot of people and bond with friends.

Using advanced imaging data, researchers showed that newborns exhibit robust connectivity in regions responsible for visual and social processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infants with stronger early connectivity paid greater attention to faces at four months and displayed fewer social difficulties by 18 months. The discovery sheds light on the neural roots of social behavior and could inform early detection of autism spectrum disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain’s social perception network is active within weeks of birth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Connectivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Stronger newborn brain connectivity predicts better facial attention and social outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autism Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could help identify early markers for social difficulties linked to autism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Yale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paying less attention to faces is one of the key markers of autism spectrum disorder. But while researchers have begun to uncover the brain network that supports processing of social stimuli such as faces, gaze, and speech, little is known about how and when it begins to develop.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, Yale researchers have now found that this network is already quite active at birth or shortly thereafter, a finding that provides insight into the brain processes that underlie social behaviors later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113192"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-brian-network-babies-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-brian-network-babies-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-brian-network-babies-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-brian-network-babies-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-brian-network-babies-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-brian-network-babies-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-brian-network-babies-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-brian-network-babies-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a baby's face." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-brian-network-babies-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-brian-network-babies-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-brian-network-babies-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-brian-network-babies-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-brian-network-babies-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-brian-network-babies-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-brian-network-babies-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers then did a similar analysis with children who had a family member with autism spectrum disorder, which increases their likelihood of developing social difficulties. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was recently published in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry: Global Open Science.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suspected this pathway—known as the social perception pathway—might be functional very early in development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Newborns are already showing preference for faces and gaze,” says Katarzyna Chawarska, PhD, Emily Fraser Beede Professor of Child Psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine (YSM) and co-senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the researchers used data from the Developing Human Connectome Project, a study funded by the European Research Council that’s collecting brain imaging, clinical and behavioral data, and genetic information from children up to 10 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the project’s magnetic resonance imaging data, the researchers assessed the functional connectivity across the brain areas that make up the social perception pathway, which includes regions dedicated to vision processing and an area called the superior temporal sulcus that specializes in processing faces, speech, and gaze information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that connectivity within this network was already quite robust within a couple of weeks after birth,” says senior author Dustin Scheinost, PhD, associate director of biomedical imaging technologies at the Yale Biomedical Imaging Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding suggests that some of the social preferences seen in babies early on might be reliant on this pathway, Chawarska explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Brain connectivity is linked to facial attention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then did a similar analysis with children who had a family member with autism spectrum disorder, which increases their likelihood of developing social difficulties. Within this group, the pathway also appeared to be interconnected at birth, as the researchers had observed in the Developing Human Connectome Project participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they followed this second group of children over time, the researchers found that children who displayed stronger connectivity in the social perception pathway shortly after birth paid more attention to faces when they were 4 months old. Further, greater attention to faces at 4 months old was associated with fewer social difficulties at 18 months of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that the cortical brain processes that give rise to social attention are likely at play shortly after birth and lay the foundation for development of social engagement skills,” says Chawarska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team—an interdisciplinary collaboration that included several researchers in the Child Study Center, the Department of Pediatrics, and the Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging at YSM, as well as the Department of Statistics and Data Science in Yale’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences—is digging further into this area. They are currently looking at additional measures of attention and following a larger group of children over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work will help us understand more about the brain processes that drive social attention in typical development and that may be involved in the social vulnerabilities we know are associated with autism,” says Chawarska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759611100143"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; When does the brain’s social perception network begin developing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers found that it is already active within weeks after birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759611110966"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What does this social perception brain network control?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; It governs how the brain processes faces, speech, and gaze—key elements of social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759611145919"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How is this social perception brain network linked to autism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Babies with stronger early connectivity in this pathway showed better attention to faces and fewer social difficulties later, suggesting early brain wiring shapes social development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this social neuroscience and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/mallory-locklear/#links-details-section" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mallory Locklear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Mallory Locklear – Yale&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsgos.2025.100597" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Functional connectivity in the social perception pathway at birth is linked with attention to faces at 4 months&lt;/a&gt;” by Katarzyna Chawarska et al. &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry: Global Open Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional connectivity in the social perception pathway at birth is linked with attention to faces at 4 months&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0015"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The right-lateralized social perception pathway, including the superior temporal sulcus, supports processing of dynamic, multimodal facial cues, while the right-lateralized ventral pathway, including the fusiform gyrus, is involved in processing static facial features. However, little is known about the early development of these pathways or their links to later social outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examined intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) in these pathways in neurotypical neonates and those with a familial risk for autism. We also investigated whether neonatal iFC was associated with reduced attention to faces at 4 months—an early autism biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0020"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;IFC was measured in 310 full-term, typically developing neonates from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) at 41 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA; SD = 1.7), and in 73 full-term Yale neonates with and without a family history of autism at 44 weeks PMA (SD = 1.3). Attention to faces was assessed at 4.1 months (SD = 0.3) via eye-tracking in 37 Yale participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All four pathways showed significant iFC (p &amp;lt; 0.001), with no sex differences (p &amp;gt; 0.159). Connectivity in the social pathway increased with age (p &amp;lt; 0.001). In Yale neonates, only iFC in the right social pathway was positively associated with attention to faces at 4 months [r(37) = 0.456, p = 0.006]. Greater attention to faces predicted fewer social concerns at 18 months [r(33) = –0.358, p = 0.010].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right-lateralized social perception pathway represents an area of interest for identifying early neural markers of social vulnerabilities associated with autism.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2025 20:53:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5TNmE0WTBpT0NIVENlTmQtUHNrQmdBODQ1UU5LWmNBbTZ0MThhSGVHanR3U2RINXFrVW9YVVlZX1pNemNDQlNFRnZ5cjd4MmFTdFFPZzY3Z3U1MDNscGwxTzI0VEtFWVc3QTRTTm5WOEo</guid></item><item><title>三种常见水果可以帮助美国人更快入睡，睡得更好- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/news/three-common-fruits-help-americans-182859184.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If counting sheep isn't working, Americans may want to hit the fruit aisle next time they are at the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain fruits packed with natural hormones and minerals can help people fall asleep.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cinnamon’s antioxidants may protect cells, lower inflammation and reduce chronic disease risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Around a teaspoon a day may help control blood sugar, boost insulin sensitivity and support heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be mindful about consuming large doses or cinnamon supplements, as they can interact with medications and have negative health effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cinnamon isn’t just a cozy spice for your latte or oatmeal—it’s one of the oldest known spices, used for centuries for both flavor and potential health benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And according to dietitians, modern research is beginning to confirm what ancient traditions may have believed. “Cinnamon offers several health benefits thanks to its high antioxidant content and anti-inflammatory properties,” says &lt;a href="https://www.samanthadevitonutrition.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Samantha DeVito, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;. Keep reading to learn why cinnamon is so good for you, plus the best ways to add it to your routine.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Cinnamon is full of antioxidants, particularly polyphenols like cinnamic acid and cinnamaldehyde,” says &lt;a href="https://www.diabetesteam.com/writers/683f0deb46c7aa1e0f3349e2" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Avery Zenker, RD, M.A.N&lt;/a&gt;.  Antioxidants help the body neutralize oxidative stress, a process that can otherwise damage cells and contribute to chronic inflammation. When the body is exposed to inflammation over extended periods, the risk of metabolic diseases increases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Cinnamon’s abundant antioxidant profile could help protect your cells from damage, slow aging-related processes and may reduce the risk of chronic diseases,” Zenker adds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cinnamon has been widely studied for its potential role in regulating blood sugar levels. Its plant compounds may mimic insulin, making it easier for the body to move glucose into cells and lowering blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research has tested a range of cinnamon doses to see if more is better, but benefits don’t seem to depend on the amount consumed. “Even as little as a teaspoon (about 2 grams) per day could improve blood sugar regulation in some individuals,” says Zenker. “It has also been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce post-meal blood sugar spikes, which is particularly relevant for people with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes,” DeVito tells &lt;em&gt;EatingWell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Whether consumed in foods, teas or supplements, cinnamon may help improve blood sugar control in people with and without diabetes,” says &lt;a href="https://sheridietitian.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sheri Gaw, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Could Benefit Heart Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to both Zenker and DeVito, cinnamon may also play a supportive role in maintaining healthy cholesterol and triglyceride levels—two key markers of cardiovascular risk. Some recent studies suggest that regular cinnamon intake is linked to lower total and LDL (often called “bad”) cholesterol levels, reductions in triglycerides and improvements in HDL cholesterol—the “good” cholesterol that helps protect your arteries.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Cinnamon may also have modest benefits for blood pressure, though findings are mixed,” adds Zenker. One study found that consuming cinnamon consistently for eight weeks led to lower blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While cinnamon alone won’t replace other heart-healthy habits or doctor-recommended treatments, adding it regularly to meals is one simple way to give your cardiovascular system an extra boost.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Might Help Reduce Inflammation-Related Disorders &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many health conditions are influenced by chronic inflammation, and the plant compounds in cinnamon may help calm inflammatory pathways. These benefits could be particularly beneficial for individuals managing arthritis, heart disease and type 2 diabetes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Cinnamon intake has been associated with reduced systemic inflammation, including lower levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation,” says Zenker.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Further research is needed to investigate the long-term effects. Still, adding cinnamon to meals may offer gentle support against the kind of ongoing inflammation that can worsen symptoms of chronic disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cinnamon is usually consumed in small amounts, so it doesn’t provide a significant source of calories or major nutrients. Here’s the breakdown for 1 teaspoon (2.6 grams) of ground cinnamon:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For most people, cinnamon is generally safe in the small amounts typically used for flavoring food. Studies on potential health benefits have examined doses of about 1 to 6 grams per day—roughly ½ teaspoon to 2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dietitians say that the type of cinnamon you choose may make a difference. Cassia cinnamon, the variety most often sold in grocery stores, contains higher levels of coumarin, a natural compound that can be harmful to the liver in large amounts.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Excessive coumarin intake can lead to liver damage, and symptoms like dizziness, diarrhea and vomiting,” says Zenker.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Ceylon cinnamon—sometimes called “true cinnamon”—has very little coumarin and is considered a safer choice if you use cinnamon regularly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s also important to be cautious with supplements or very large amounts. “Large doses of cinnamon, either in the powder or supplement form, may interact with some medications (blood thinners, antibiotic and diabetes or heart medications) or cause mouth irritation or liver toxicity,” says Gaw.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cinnamon is one of the easiest spices to incorporate into your diet. Here are some dietitian-approved ideas:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Stir into oatmeal, yogurt, smoothies or coffee for a delicious addition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sprinkle on roasted sweet potatoes, squash or carrots.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mix into homemade granola, energy bites or baked goods for a cozy treat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add a dash to chili, curries or stews for extra depth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pair with fruit like apples, pears, peaches or bananas for a natural flavor boost.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cinnamon is a staple in the spice rack with several potential health benefits. Its antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds could support blood sugar control, heart health and even help ease the effects of chronic inflammation. Still, experts emphasize that cinnamon works best as part of an overall balanced diet—it’s not a substitute for medical care or other healthy lifestyle habits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you consume it frequently, keep portions moderate and be aware of potential medication interactions. Ask a health care provider if you’re unsure. Otherwise, sprinkling cinnamon into your meals is an easy, flavorful way to add a bit of extra wellness to your routine.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies suggest ½ teaspoon to 2 teaspoons a day may be enough to see potential benefits. Be sure to talk to a health care professional or registered dietitian for individualized advice before adding cinnamon into your daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, large doses may affect blood thinners, antibiotics and diabetes or heart medicines. Always talk to a health care provider for specific information on how foods (including cinnamon) may impact any medications you’re taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

For Georgie, 33, it meant constant restlessness, unfinished tasks and feeling, as she put it, ‘bad at life’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She says: ‘I had hoped the jab would help me &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-de8dcb80-a122-11f0-a3f3-4dc79573bc0d"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt;. But I realised that when I took them, it was as if the static in my head had dialled down. I could put laundry away, run the dishwasher, declutter the house – things that had felt impossible before.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Georgie, from Petersfield in Hampshire, lives with her sales director husband Greg and their six-year-old daughter Margo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once a keen hockey player, she gradually gained weight until she reached her heaviest at 21st. ‘I had a personal trainer two or three times a week, I ate healthily but the weight just wouldn’t shift,’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Georgie Robinson was struggling with her weight and ADHD when she started taking Mounjaro weight-loss jabs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After months of hesitation, she decided to try Mounjaro. Within ten weeks on the lowest 2.5mg dose, she had lost two stone. Over the following months, the weight reduction slowed but the total loss reached 4st. She returned to hockey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, Georgie was pursuing another suspicion: ADHD. Awareness and diagnoses have soared in recent years, particularly among women, as doctors recognise the condition – that affects about 2.6 million people in the UK – often presents differently to the hyperactive boys it was once thought to affect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recalling her diagnosis in March, after a video consultation, Georgie says: ‘I felt like a weight had lifted off me. For the first time in years, I could stop blaming myself.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The revelation of just how much Mounjaro was helping came by accident. Last month, when a price hike left her without the drug for two weeks, she says the cravings for high calorie treats returned – but so did her ADHD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Georgie says: ‘I felt hungrier, I expected that, but what shocked me was my brain. Suddenly I couldn’t finish jobs. I was back to half-done tasks, impulsive spending, emotional ups and downs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When I restarted Mounjaro, it all settled again. I could focus, I could tick off my to-do lists.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Within ten weeks on the lowest 2.5mg dose of Mounjaro, Georgie had lost 2st &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have long known that blood-sugar fluctuations can affect mood, concentration and impulsivity. Mounjaro, known generically as tirzepatide, was originally developed for type 2 diabetes and helps regulate insulin and appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Georgie says: ‘It could just be that by changing my diet with Mounjaro, it’s stabilising my blood-sugar levels, which could be quietening my brain – but it feels like more than that.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is mounting evidence weight-loss jabs may have benefits far beyond slimming and diabetes control. Large clinical trials show they can slash the risk of heart disease while early studies suggest they may dampen addictive behaviours, such as alcohol cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it comes to ADHD, however, doctors stress there is no clinical trial evidence the drugs make a difference. However, anecdotal reports are emerging in patient forums – and other reports have claimed anti-diabetic medication semaglutide ‘may be able to soften the traits of ADHD’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another striking change for Georgie has been relief from PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder), a severe form of PMS. She says: ‘Since being on Mounjaro, I haven’t had PMDD symptoms. It’s like a double gift.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts caution against reading too much into such personal accounts, however. Katya Rubia, professor of cognitive neuroscience at King’s College London, says there is ‘substantial evidence of overlap’ between ADHD and obesity, which may explain why some report crossover benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adds: ‘ADHD is significantly more common among people with obesity. This relationship is complex and likely multifactorial. Shared behavioural characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘At the biological level, there appears to be both a genetic and neurobiological overlap. Neuroimaging studies suggest shared dysfunctions in brain networks, particularly dopamine-related reward pathways and the frontal lobes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This may explain why individuals with ADHD often experience food cravings. There is also evidence inflammation in the brain, potentially influenced by poor diet, may contribute to both ADHD and obesity, and this may also help explain links with depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘However, it remains difficult to determine the direction of causality – whether ADHD predisposes to obesity, obesity contributes to ADHD symptoms, or whether both share common underlying mechanisms.

And acclaimed facial plastic surgeon Dr Amir Karam says this is especially true when it comes to our skin and appearance (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, Dr Karam highlighted the importance of collagen-boosting foods that can help to improve skin elasticity, resilience and hydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He recommended stocking up on organic chicken breasts as they are an excellent source of protein, providing all nine essential amino acids, including lysine, which is vital for collagen production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another food on his shopping list to aid collagen production is bone broth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Karam explained: 'Consuming it gives your body exactly what it needs to create and build collagen, as well as hydrate the skin and just give areas outside of the skin, joints, everything else, all those important things that it needs to function better.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the skin constantly bombarded by pollutants and toxins in a modern environment, Dr Karam stressed the importance of foods rich in antioxidants, substances that protect cells from toxins, and vitamin C to help create a protective barrier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin C packs a double punch, the surgeon said and is also essential for boosting collagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the 'easiest and most delicious and ways' to get both vitamin C and antioxidants, Dr Karam said, is through berries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His go-tos are blueberries and strawberries, but other foods he recommended include bell peppers and grapefruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He suggested infusing water with berries and grapefruit as a refreshing, sugar-free way to stay hydrated while getting the nutrients back into your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Karam also said leafy green vegetables are important sources of vitamin C and antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said broccoli sprouts are exceptionally high in sulforaphane, a powerful compound that helps protect the skin against UV-induced damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sprouts can contain 10 to 100 times more sulforaphane than mature broccoli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Organic chicken breasts are an excellent source of protein, providing all nine essential amino acids, including lysine, which is vital for collagen production&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Avocados are deemed the best food for supple, moisturized skin as they are rich in healthy fats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A balanced gut is key to achieving clear, radiant skin, Dr Karam revealed, through a complex network called the gut-skin axis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A healthy gut promotes a strong immune system, reduces inflammation, and aids in the absorption of vital nutrients for skin regeneration and protection, leading to a glowing complexion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told viewers: 'So having probiotics and prebiotics in your diet helps with the inflammation that helps calm and prevent acne, redness, and skin sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So absolutely important to have that really strong gut skin connection.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained that probiotics are the healthy gut bacteria, while prebiotics are the fuel that helps them do their job effectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of Dr Karam's 'gut healthy heroes' include sauerkraut and probiotic yogurt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, his prebiotic recommendations are chia seeds, green leafy vegetables and avocados.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Avocados are also deemed the best food for supple, moisturized skin as they are rich in healthy fats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats found in avocados, including oleic acid, help strengthen the skin's moisture barrier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This reduces water loss from the skin, helping to keep it hydrated, soft, and supple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other sources of healthy fats, Dr Karam said, come from nuts and seeds as well as extra virgin olive oil. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Karam highlights the importance of collagen-boosting foods which can help to improve skin elasticity, resilience and hydration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, the surgeon suggested gravitating toward foods rich in omega-3s to combat inflammation because these fatty acids are powerful anti-inflammatory agents that reduce inflammation, which is linked to aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Omega-3s, such as EPA and DHA (found in eggs and fatty fish such as salmon and sardines) and plant-based ALA (found in flaxseed and chia seeds) help regulate the body's inflammatory processes, thereby supporting overall health and potentially slowing the aging process by helping to prevent wrinkles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Karam eats salmon several times a week with his family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with food, the Californian said that seasonings and spices can play a role in skin health, as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He revealed certain spices like turmeric and ginger contain powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds that can combat oxidative stress and cellular damage not only on skin level but in the body too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor concluded: '&lt;span&gt;So, that's an incredible comprehensive list of foods that are great for our bodies that taste wonderful and make a huge impact in our skin health moving forward.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Along with a nutrient-rich diet, Dr Karam said other products that can help prevent premature aging includes sun protection and a daily skincare routine that 'complements everything else that you're doing.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-bce99ec0-9e1e-11f0-a9b9-b94c99276d56" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15146217/dollar-grocery-store-staples-reverse-aging-revealed-plastic-surgeon.html"&gt;

Many people take vitamin D supplements to support their bone and immune health and meet the UK government recommendation of 10 micrograms (µg) each day, especially during the winter months.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two forms of vitamin D supplements available: vitamin D2 and vitamin D3. Researchers have found that taking vitamin D2 supplements can lead to a drop in the body's concentration of vitamin D3, which is the form our bodies naturally produce from sunlight and use most effectively to raise overall vitamin D levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrition Reviews&lt;/em&gt;, analysed data from randomised controlled trials and found that vitamin D2 supplementation resulted in a reduction in vitamin D3 levels compared to those not taking a vitamin D2 supplement. In many of the studies, the vitamin D3 levels went lower than in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily Brown, PhD Research Fellow and Lead Researcher of the study from the University of Surrey's Nutrition, Exercise, Chronobiology &amp;amp; Sleep Discipline, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Vitamin D supplements are important, especially between October and March, when our bodies cannot make vitamin D from sunlight in the UK. However, we discovered that vitamin D2 supplements can actually decrease levels of vitamin D3 in the body, which is a previously unknown effect of taking these supplements. This study suggests that subject to personal considerations, vitamin D3 supplements may be more beneficial for most individuals over vitamin D2."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Cathie Martin, Group Leader at the John Innes Centre, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This meta-analysis highlights the importance of ensuring plant-based vitamin D3 is accessible in the UK."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research supports a previous study published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Immunology&lt;/em&gt;, led by Professor Colin Smith from the University of Surrey, which suggests that vitamin D2 and D3 do not have identical roles in supporting immune function. Vitamin D3 has a modifying effect on the immune system that could fortify the body against viral and bacterial diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Colin Smith said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have shown that vitamin D3, but not vitamin D2, appears to stimulate the type I interferon signalling system in the body -- a key part of the immune system that provides a first line of defence against bacteria and viruses. Thus, a healthy vitamin D3 status may help prevent viruses and bacteria from gaining a foothold in the body."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further research into the different functionalities of vitamin D2 and D3 should be a priority in deciding whether vitamin D3 should be the first-line choice of vitamin D supplement, subject to individual requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Martin Warren, Chief Scientific Officer at the Quadram Institute, said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Vitamin D deficiency represents a significant public health concern, especially during the winter months with significant deficiency across the UK population. This collaborative research effort aligns well with the Quadram Institute's mission to deliver healthier lives through food innovation to enhance the nutrient density of the food we eat. Tackling this with the most effective form of vitamin D supplementation or fortification is of the utmost importance to the health of the nation."&lt;/p&gt;

Many of us treat the bathroom as a mini-retreat where we catch up on news, social media, or emails while seated on the toilet. It seems harmless. But recent reports and medical experts are raising red flags: this habit can carry dangers beyond mere hemorrhoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0329983"&gt;PLOS One&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston found that adults who use smartphones on the toilet have a 46% higher risk of hemorrhoids than those who don’t. Why? Because using a phone tends to stretch out how long you stay on the toilet, increasing pressure in the rectal veins. That alone may explain much of the risk. What drives this risk? Mainly, increased time sitting on the toilet (especially more than 5 minutes per visit), more pressure on anal and rectal veins, reduced physical activity, and distraction leading to poor habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As hygiene issues, posture stress, bacterial exposure, chronic straining, and vascular pressure mingle in this small space, what starts as a convenient habit may silently chip away at your lower-body health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we explore seven specific health conditions or risks linked with phone use on the toilet. We discuss what recent studies show, how each condition develops, and simple changes you can make to avoid becoming vulnerable. Below are several health conditions that are (or may be) linked to this particular bathroom habit, how the phone-on-toilet behavior contributes, and what you can do to reduce the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2025 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>新研究发现，糖尿病前期可以在不减肥的情况下缓解- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-prediabetes-remission-pounds.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a long-held belief in diabetes prevention that weight loss is the main way to lower disease risk. Our new study challenges this.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;For decades, people diagnosed with prediabetes—a condition affecting up to one in three adults depending on age—have been told the same thing by their doctors: eat healthily and lose weight to avoid developing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/diabetes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach hasn't been working for all. Despite unchanged medical recommendations for more than 20 years, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/diabetes-612" target="_blank"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; prevalence &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1043-2760%2825%2900004-9" target="_blank"&gt;continues rising&lt;/a&gt; globally. Most people with prediabetes find weight-loss goals hard to reach, leaving them discouraged and still at high risk of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03944-9" target="_blank"&gt;latest research&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, reveals a different approach entirely. We found that prediabetes can go into remission—with blood sugar returning to normal—even without weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one in four people in lifestyle intervention programs bring their blood sugar back to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-024-00996-8" target="_blank"&gt;normal&lt;/a&gt; without losing any weight. Remarkably, this weight-stable remission protects against future diabetes just as effectively as remission achieved through &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(23)00235-8/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;This represents a significant shift in how doctors might treat overweight or obese patients at high risk for diabetes. But how is it possible to reduce &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+glucose+levels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood glucose levels&lt;/a&gt; without losing weight, or even while gaining weight?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer lies in how fat is distributed throughout the body. Not all body fat behaves the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visceral fat deep in our abdomen, surrounding our internal organs, acts as a metabolic troublemaker. This belly fat drives &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+inflammation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; that interferes with insulin—the hormone responsible for controlling blood sugar levels. When insulin can't function properly, blood glucose rises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, subcutaneous fat—the fat directly under our skin—can be beneficial. This type of fat tissue produces hormones that help insulin work more effectively. Our study shows that people who reverse prediabetes without weight loss shift fat from deep within their abdomen to beneath their skin, even if their total weight stays the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also uncovered another piece of the puzzle. Natural hormones that are mimicked by new weight-loss medications like Wegovy and Mounjaro appear to play a crucial role in this process. These hormones, particularly GLP-1, help &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/pancreatic+beta+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pancreatic beta cells&lt;/a&gt; secrete insulin when &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+sugar/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; levels rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who reverse their prediabetes without losing weight seem to naturally enhance this hormone system, while simultaneously suppressing other hormones that typically drive glucose levels higher.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Targeting fat redistribution, not just weight loss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical implications are encouraging. Instead of focusing only on the scales, people with prediabetes can aim to shift &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/body+fat/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;body fat&lt;/a&gt; with diet and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research shows that polyunsaturated fatty acids, abundant in Mediterranean diets rich in fish oil, olives and nuts, may help reduce visceral belly fat. Similarly, endurance training can decrease abdominal fat even without overall weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean weight loss should be abandoned as a goal—it remains beneficial for overall health and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/diabetes+prevention/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;diabetes prevention&lt;/a&gt;. However, our findings suggest that achieving normal blood glucose levels, regardless of weight changes, should become a primary target for prediabetes treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach could help millions of people who have struggled with traditional weight-loss programs but might still achieve meaningful health improvements through metabolic changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For health care providers, this research suggests a need to broaden treatment approaches beyond weight-focused interventions. Monitoring blood glucose improvements and encouraging fat redistribution through targeted nutrition and exercise could provide alternative pathways to diabetes prevention for patients who find weight loss particularly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications extend globally, where diabetes represents one of the fastest-growing health problems. By recognizing that prediabetes can improve without weight loss, we open new possibilities for preventing a disease that affects &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1043-2760%2825%2900004-9" target="_blank"&gt;hundreds of millions worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and continues rapidly expanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research fundamentally reframes diabetes prevention, suggesting that metabolic health improvements—not just weight reduction—should be central to clinical practice. For the many people living with prediabetes who have felt discouraged by unsuccessful &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/weight+loss/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;weight-loss&lt;/a&gt; attempts, this offers renewed hope and practical alternative strategies for reducing their diabetes risk.&lt;/p&gt;

The findings suggest that one part of the amygdala in particular shows distinct patterns of connectivity in people with the condition, which may help explain difficulties with emotional regulation, sensory processing, and self-related thought often seen in PTSD. This research highlights how focusing on the smaller subdivisions of the amygdala may deepen scientific understanding of PTSD’s neural foundations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amygdala is often described as the brain’s “fear center,” due to its well-established role in detecting threats and triggering fight-or-flight responses. However, scientists now recognize that it plays broader roles in how we experience emotions, respond to rewards, and process sensory information. Previous research has shown that the amygdala functions differently in people with PTSD, but many studies have treated the amygdala as a single unit. This approach may be overlooking subtle but important differences in how its internal structures behave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, the amygdala is made up of several distinct regions, or subnuclei, that connect to different parts of the brain and support different functions. These subnuclei include the basolateral, centromedial, and superficial regions, each of which is thought to contribute uniquely to emotion, behavior, and bodily responses. The new study aimed to clarify how these substructures connect with the rest of the brain in people with PTSD compared to those without trauma exposure. By focusing on these smaller components, the researchers hoped to uncover more precise patterns of brain function associated with the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people have heard of the ‘fight or flight’ response—how your body reacts when you’re scared. A key player in that response is a part of the brain called the amygdala, which is also heavily involved in PTSD,” said study author Elizabeth Haris of the University of Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In most research, the amygdala is treated as though it’s one single structure. But in reality, it’s made up of several smaller regions that may each play different roles. We wanted to look more closely at how these smaller regions connect to other parts of the brain. By comparing people with PTSD to those without trauma exposure, we hoped to see whether these connection patterns could give us new insights into how PTSD affects the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, the researchers analyzed brain scans from 129 adults: 65 individuals with PTSD and 64 non-traumatized participants. The PTSD group included civilians who had experienced a variety of traumas. Nearly half reported trauma in childhood, and many also had conditions like depression or anxiety. None of the participants had a history of psychosis, traumatic brain injury, or substance dependence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of using data from a typical resting-state brain scan, the researchers used a method known as task-derived intrinsic functional connectivity. Participants had completed five separate cognitive and emotional tasks while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. The researchers removed task-related brain activity from the scans to isolate underlying connectivity patterns that persist across different mental states. This approach has been found to provide reliable information about how brain regions interact, even when tasks are involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then divided each participant’s amygdala into three substructures in each hemisphere: the basolateral, centromedial, and superficial regions. Using these as starting points, they measured how strongly each region was functionally connected to other areas of the brain. Functional connectivity refers to how synchronized the activity of different brain regions is over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main finding was that the patterns of brain connectivity linked to the basolateral region of the amygdala were significantly different between people with PTSD and those without trauma exposure. In contrast, no group differences were found for the centromedial or superficial regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One surprise was that we only found clear differences in brain connectivity for one part of the amygdala—the basolateral amygdala—and not the other two regions we looked at,” Haris told PsyPost. “This shows why it’s so important to study these smaller subregions individually, because they don’t all behave the same way. Notably, the lack of differences in the other areas could also mean a few things. It might be because those regions are physically smaller and harder to measure, or because they’re more active in specific situations rather than when the brain is at rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, one of these regions, the centromedial amygdala, is especially linked to generating responses, so its role might stand out more if people were doing a task instead of just resting in the scanner. Overall, this tells us there’s still so much to learn. Each part of the amygdala has its own role, and exploring those differences could help us uncover even more about how PTSD affects the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For individuals with PTSD, the basolateral region showed reduced connectivity with several cortical areas, including the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, precentral and postcentral gyri, and the superior parietal lobe. These brain regions are typically involved in bodily sensation, movement, attention, and self-referential thought—mental processes involved in understanding one’s own feelings or sense of identity. Reduced connectivity in these networks may contribute to PTSD symptoms such as emotional numbness, identity disturbance, or impaired control over bodily reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the PTSD group showed increased connectivity between the basolateral amygdala and a different set of brain areas, particularly in the brainstem, cerebellum, and right pallidum. These areas are associated with arousal, threat detection, motor control, and processing rewards or punishments. For example, the brainstem helps regulate automatic functions like heart rate and stress responses, while the pallidum is linked to motivation and reward-seeking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings suggest that the basolateral amygdala may be more strongly tied to systems involved in alertness and stress in people with PTSD, while being less engaged with networks responsible for self-awareness and sensory regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at within-group differences. In the non-traumatized group, the basolateral amygdala had stronger connections to cortical regions, while the superficial region tended to connect more with subcortical areas. In contrast, for the PTSD group, the basolateral region had stronger connections to both cortical and subcortical areas than the other amygdala subregions did, indicating its dominant role in altered connectivity patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These group differences held up even after accounting for factors like age and education. The results were also not explained by common co-occurring conditions such as depression or generalized anxiety disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main takeaway is that the amygdala is much more complex than we often think,” Haris said. “Most people know it as the ‘fear center’ of the brain, or the place that drives the fight-or-flight response. But our study shows it’s also involved in many other processes. When we look more closely at its smaller parts, we see links not only to fear and arousal, but also to things like how we process sensory information, how we respond to rewards, how we think about ourselves, and even how we integrate thoughts and movements. In short, the amygdala isn’t just about fear—it plays a role in a wide range of experiences and behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also provides support for the idea that PTSD may involve imbalances in how different brain networks communicate, particularly those related to emotional and bodily regulation. The basolateral amygdala appears to sit at the center of these altered patterns, acting as a hub that is either underconnected to some cortical systems or overconnected to brain regions associated with arousal and vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern may help explain why people with PTSD often report feeling constantly on edge or disconnected from themselves or their bodies. The increased links between the amygdala and brainstem could reflect heightened threat detection, while the reduced links with areas like the precuneus might relate to difficulties with self-reflection or integrating sensory input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By identifying these more specific changes in brain communication, the findings support the view that PTSD is not a uniform disruption of the fear system, but a more nuanced shift in how various brain regions interact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Like all research, our study has some limitations,” Haris noted. “The biggest one is the comparison group we used. When studying PTSD, you ideally want to compare people with PTSD to people who have also experienced trauma but not developed PTSD. In our case, the comparison group wasn’t quite that ‘gold standard,’ so it’s important to keep that in mind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study offers a detailed look into how different parts of the amygdala function in PTSD and how they relate to broader brain systems. The findings support the idea that the amygdala plays a wider role than just fear detection. By focusing on its internal structure, researchers may gain a clearer understanding of the diverse symptoms of PTSD and open new paths for treatment targeting specific brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking ahead, our next steps involve using a more advanced type of MRI scanner, called a 7T scanner,” Haris said. “This technology gives us much higher resolution images of the brain, which means we can see the amygdala’s subregions in even greater detail than before. The study we’ve just discussed used a standard 3T scanner, which is still very valuable, but the 7T scanner allows us to push the boundaries further and to even better understand how these subregions of the amygdala contribute to PTSD. We’ve already started this work, and we’re excited to share those findings soon!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d just like to highlight that this study was truly a team effort,” she added. “It took many years and countless hours of data collection, and it wouldn’t have been possible without the dedication of both the research team and the participants who generously gave their time. We’re very grateful to them, because their contributions are what make it possible to move this research forward and deepen our understanding of PTSD and, most importantly, how to better help people who are going through it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-025-03508-y" target="_blank"&gt;Functional connectivity profiles of amygdala subregions in posttraumatic stress disorder&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Elizabeth M.

In that time, 445 participants developed pancreatic cancer. The scientists compared those individuals’ oral bacterial and fungal profiles with a matched control group to see which microbes were more common in the “cancer group.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="u" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What are the key findings?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified 24-27 species of oral bacteria and fungi that were individually associated with increased, or in some cases decreased, risk of pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the standout 3 bacteria were Porphyromonas gingivalis, Eubacterium nodatum, and Parvimonas micra – species already linked to gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of fungi, species of the Candida genus showed an association with higher pancreatic cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these risk microbes were combined into a microbial risk score (MRS), people with higher scores had about a 3.4 to 3.5-fold greater risk of pancreatic cancer compared to those with lower scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed late, the authors propose that profiling the mouth’s microbiome might one day serve as a noninvasive biomarker to flag high-risk individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the researchers emphasize that the study finds correlation, not clear causation.

The pancreas is a gland located behind the stomach that plays a crucial role in digestion and blood sugar regulation by producing enzymes and hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the exact causes are not always clear, risk factors include smoking, family history of pancreatic cancer, long-standing type 2 diabetes, and chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic cancer is often difficult to diagnose early because symptoms may be subtle or absent in the early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As pancreatic cancer is notoriously stealthy in its early stages and many cases are found late, knowing possible early signs and symptoms can help with earlier detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some red flags to watch out for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Abdominal pain that radiates toward the back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Unexplained weight loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Loss of appetite or feeling full quickly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Jaundice (yellowing of skin or eyes), especially if accompanied by dark urine or pale stools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;New-onset diabetes or worsening control in someone who already has diabetes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Digestive issues like nausea or indigestion, sometimes after meals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these symptoms are common to many other conditions, they are often overlooked until the disease progresses.

In an Instagram video posted on October 3, the doctor reveals six daily habits you can practice every day - ranging from walking after meals to taking cold showers - and explains why they are beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cold showers improve mood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Sood, cold exposure can trigger a surge of norepinephrine, which lifts mood and increases alertness. He explains, “Trials show hot-to-cold showers can reduce self-reported sick days and raise perceived energy. Evidence for &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/study-reveals-this-common-social-drink-raises-depression-risk-in-women-and-it-is-not-alcohol-101758871641142.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="depression"&gt;depression &lt;/a&gt;is limited but promising.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Walking after meals balance glucose spike&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sood suggests that walking for 10 to 30 meals after eating meals helps balance glucose spikes. It also “helps with &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/gastroenterologist-explains-dangers-of-chronic-acid-reflux-shares-10-tips-to-reduce-it-lose-weight-dont-smoke-101753433546354.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="reflux"&gt;reflux&lt;/a&gt;, and can prevent post-meal drops in blood pressure in older adults. Best results come from short walks spread throughout the day.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lifting weights lowers insulin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor highlights, “Resistance training increases GLUT4 transporters in muscle, improving insulin sensitivity and lowering HbA1c in type 2 diabetes.” This lowers insulin levels and Dr Sood also adds, “More muscle mass also enhances glucose handling and body composition.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also Read |&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/dermatologist-explains-why-people-in-their-20s-and-30s-are-experiencing-premature-grey-hair-shares-tips-to-prevent-it-101758726183525.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Dermatologist explains why people in their 20s and 30s are experiencing premature grey hair; shares tips to prevent it"&gt;Dermatologist explains why people in their 20s and 30s are experiencing premature grey hair; shares tips to prevent it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Morning sun improves sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposure to bright sunlight in the morning helps regulate your circadian rhythm.

He suggests, “Practicing daily for 10-15 minutes can lower systolic pressure by 3-8 mmHg on average.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Standing for 5 minutes hourly has many benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sood points out, “Breaking up long sitting periods with light walking or standing improves blood sugar, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/gynaecologist-warns-pcos-linked-insulin-resistance-may-raise-type-2-diabetes-risk-shares-lifestyle-tips-to-manage-it-101757316779742.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="insulin"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt;, and blood pressure.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;University College London's National Amyloidosis Center leads a multinational team reporting that a single infusion of an in vivo gene-editing therapy (nexiguran ziclumeran) produced rapid, deep, and durable reductions in serum transthyretin for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, with disease measures largely stable or improved through 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy is a rare, multisystem, progressive, debilitating, and fatal disease characterized by deposition of misfolded transthyretin (TTR) protein in peripheral nerves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the bloodstream, TTR assembles as a four-part protein complex, or tetramer, that normally transports thyroxine and a retinol-binding protein. Pathogenic variants destabilize this complex and drive its dissociation into monomers that misfold and accumulate in tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Median survival from disease onset ranges from six to 12 years and varies with age at onset, TTR variant, cardiac involvement, and promptness of treatment. Current treatments require repeated lifelong administration and do not always halt &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/disease+progression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;disease progression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Nexiguran Ziclumeran Gene Editing in Hereditary ATTR with Polyneuropathy," &lt;a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2510209" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a Phase I, single-group, open-label trial to assess the safety and pharmacodynamics of nexiguran ziclumeran and evaluate effects on neurologic function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enrollment included 36 patients with a mean Neuropathy Impairment Score of 31. Treatments took place at four sites in France, New Zealand, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, with a mean follow-up of 27 months. The primary pharmacodynamic measure was serum TTR level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polyneuropathy disability score stayed stable in 27 participants, improved in five, and worsened in two. Familial amyloid polyneuropathy stage stayed stable in 29 patients, improved in two, and worsened in two at month 24. Biomarkers and patient-reported measures shifted in the direction of clinical benefit by prespecified scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adverse events occurred in all patients. The most frequent were infusion-related reactions in 21 patients, headache in 10, diarrhea in eight, decreased thyroxine in eight without hypothyroidism or elevated thyrotropin, and increased aspartate aminotransferase in six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serious adverse events were reported in 11 patients. One death from cardiac amyloidosis occurred on study day 273, and one participant discontinued due to motor decline judged unrelated by investigators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors conclude that one-time nexiguran ziclumeran yields profound and durable transthyretin lowering, supporting further investigation for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;
