It also had an impact on her social life because she was worried someone might bump into her shoulder and cause her pain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Frozen shoulder, which causes pain and stiffness often brought on by an injury, can persist for months (sometimes years) and make everyday activities difficult&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, affects around a million people a year in the UK and occurs when the capsule of tissue that surrounds the shoulder joint becomes inflamed and thickens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The capsule is usually large enough to allow for a full range of motion in a normal shoulder,' says Rajeev Sharma, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon in private clinics across London and Hertfordshire, who specialises in shoulder, elbow and hand surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With an inflamed condition such as frozen shoulder, the capsule thickens - and as a result the space for movement also reduces, which is the main cause for the stiffness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people also develop neck pain as the stiffness in the shoulder joint may mean muscles in the neck overcompensate for the lack of motion in the shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Often caused by injury 'such as a fall or even a minor stretch such as reaching for something in the back of a car', Mr Sharma says a frozen shoulder is also more common if you have diabetes. The theory is that persistently high blood sugar can make the surrounding shoulder tissue thicker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he adds it is women in the 40 to 60 age bracket - the age at which most women go through the menopause - who are most at risk of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The question is, why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has suggested a link to the drop in oestrogen that occurs around menopause to an increased risk of frozen shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rajeev Sharma, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, says that women in their 40s to 60s - the age at which they go through the menopause - are most at risk of suffering from frozen shoulder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study by Duke University in the US, involving 1,952 women - of which 152 were taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) normally given to make up for the drop in oestrogen that occurs during menopause - found that patients who were not taking HRT were 99 per cent more likely to develop a frozen shoulder compared to those receiving HRT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results, published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine in 2023 make sense, says Dr Elise Dallas, a menopause specialist at The London General Practice, as oestrogen 'plays several important roles in musculoskeletal health'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Oestrogen has anti-inflammatory properties and supports bone growth, as well as connective tissue health,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As oestrogen levels drop during menopause, collagen (an integral part of the connective tissue that forms the muscles, ligaments and tendons) can become stiffer, reducing the flexibility of joints, including the shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fall in oestrogen levels also leads to an increase in levels of cytokines, compounds which can trigger inflammation in the shoulder joint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This inflammation can cause pain, thickening of the ligaments, and tightening of the joint capsule - hallmarks of frozen shoulder,' says Dr Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, others argue that one study is not enough proof that the hormonal change that occurs during menopause is to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Sharma says that as women aged 40-60 years account for most frozen shoulder patients, the condition 'will often get correlated with menopause, even though there is no direct link to the hormonal changes of menopause'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, as it is there is no 'cure' for frozen shoulder but treatments can help improve symptoms while the healing process takes place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common, says Mr Sharma, is hydrodistension or hydro-dilatation, where a combination of saline, local anaesthetic and a steroid is injected into the joint capsule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The steroid helps in reducing the symptoms of the pain and the high volume of saline attempts to relax the capsule for increased mobility of the shoulder joint,' says Mr Sharma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physiotherapy and exercise can help maintain shoulder strength - 'though sometimes exercises and physiotherapy can cause more pain when the frozen shoulder is in its initial and aggressive phase,' he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Emma tried physiotherapy and home remedies such as ice, wheat bags (small sacks that you heat up in the microwave), massages, a massage gun and 'every type of painkiller', which all helped short term, 'but sometimes the pain was horrendous'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even sitting to relax and watch TV was painful. I had to prop my left arm on a cushion because I couldn't let it drop to one side as it was too painful.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases patients may need an MRI scan to confirm diagnosis. Then a hydrocortisone injection. Mr Sharma says steroid injections 'help reduce inflammation and provide pain relief while the condition resolves itself naturally and can make the recovery journey more comfortable'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Emma's GP initially refused to refer her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then fate intervened just before Christmas in 2023 when Emma fell, injuring her shoulder. She was given an X-ray and MRI in A&amp;amp;E, which confirmed her frozen shoulder diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The doctor said they see many women of my age with it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Emma was referred a specialist at Kingston Hospital for a hydrocortisone injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had the injection in January last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I must admit, I've never felt pain like it,' says Emma. 'It was excruciating.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But within a week she felt some improvement and over the course of the next couple of months, her shoulder got progressively better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She went on holiday with her partner Stuart, 57, to Indonesia and Singapore, where as it happens, 'they refer to frozen shoulder as "50s shoulder" – clearly they have a better awareness of the link to menopause', says Emma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A year on, the mobility in Emma's shoulder has improved dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My shoulder mobility is now around 97 per cent and although I find it too painful to do something like play tennis, which I used to do two or three times a week, I'm mostly back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm doing three or four aqua aerobic sessions each week to help it improve further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just want more women to know that if they start experiencing shoulder pain around this stage of life, it's worth seeking medical advice sooner rather than later.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

He is forever obsessing over his latest ache or pain. Now that we’ve all returned to working at the office post-COVID, he wears an N95 mask all day long. He will describe symptoms he thinks he is experiencing and has even asked me to look at various moles on his body (thankfully in non-intimate places) to ask if I think he should have them removed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6fxpan00053b773o2o5o01@published"&gt;He has me chasing down information online about the latest malady he thinks he has daily, and it’s affecting my ability to get my actual work done. I’m not the only one he assigns these “research duties” to, and we are all sick of it. The human resources department at our company is beyond useless, so going to them would be a waste of time. Any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="181" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6dkwz600153b77cw3bpnsz@published"&gt;Your boss does seem to have a real illness, but it has nothing to do with moles. I can’t diagnose him through a letter, but you might be right that he has hypochondria. Also known as intense health anxiety, it is a form of mental illness that can be disruptive and dangerous, but treatable. Two main syndromes are defined in psychiatry’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554399/"&gt;illness anxiety disorder&lt;/a&gt;, or excessive fear of developing a medical condition, and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532253/"&gt;somatic symptom disorder,&lt;/a&gt; which involves excessive concern about physical symptoms. The COVID pandemic&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/mentalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmen.0000120"&gt; exacerbated many people’s health anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. (Masking at work isn’t necessarily a sign of hypochondria, though; dangerous respiratory diseases are still circulating.) The availability of Dr. Google has created a new twist on hypochondria called “&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29324396/"&gt;cyberchondria&lt;/a&gt;,” or excessive searching for medical information. You aren’t your boss’s psychiatrist, and this (among other things!) is definitely not your job, but you or one of your colleagues could tell him that intense worry about health is getting more &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-hypochondria-can-be-deadly-and-how-newer-treatments-help/"&gt;medical attention as a common and treatable problem&lt;/a&gt;—and potentially nudge him toward seeking help.&lt;/p&gt;

You could tell him that you’re simply too busy with your actual work to help search for medical information. You could say that it’s inefficient for you to do these searches since you aren’t experiencing the symptoms yourself and wouldn’t know what to follow up on. Or try the privacy approach: His perceived symptoms might lead to a diagnosis he wouldn’t want to share, and out of respect for his privacy, you don’t think it’s appropriate for you to dig into the medical literature. There’s also the “this is too serious for me” option: “I don’t feel qualified to evaluate and discuss information about health conditions, but the doctors covered by our employer’s insurance can help.”&lt;/p&gt;

I have been told I’ll receive a severance package, but I’ve had a few potential employers express interest in me. I don’t want to leave my already understaffed store without the help they need, but I know I need to protect myself in an uncertain job market. Nothing has been offered directly to me yet, but I’m very tempted by one potential employer. The employer I’m interested in knows my current employer well, and I’m scared my current employer will find out I’m on the hunt and fire me preemptively. He’s known for making snap decisions. How do I know when/if to jump ship?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2qqy001z3b7704k8qrtt@published"&gt;Your current employer did the right thing by admitting that the company is going out of business. And they are right to offer severance to reward people who stay until the end. Did they tell you how much severance? If it’s, say, three months’ worth of your salary or more, it would probably make financial sense to stay. You could use the severance-funded time to do a thorough job search, and maybe take some time off between jobs. But if they’re being vague about the amount, or if you’re worried the severance could disappear when the company does, don’t let it tie you to a doomed employer. Companies fire people all the time for their own reasons; you have every right to quit for yours.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="155" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2qr000203b77j3448qbt@published"&gt;It sounds like you need more information, and I think it’s worth the risk to have honest-ish conversations with both your current and potential employers. I suggest you start with the latter. Tell them you feel a sense of loyalty to your existing team. (Taking your job seriously makes you even more attractive as a potential hire.) Follow up by saying that you admire the future employer’s work and are intrigued by the possibility of joining them. It’s usually a good idea in a job interview (or pre-interview) to express enthusiasm for the future employer, which explains why you’re talking with them despite your loyalty to your current job. Say explicitly that you would like to keep this conversation confidential for now since you’re not actively looking for work. A potential employer should never share hiring conversations, period, but people are lousy at secrets, and it’s reasonable to confirm that they won’t mention it elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2qr200213b77k3mbmffu@published"&gt;The potential employer’s response will tell you a lot about whether you want to work there: Do they respect your privacy? Are they open about their timeline for hiring you? If they do make an offer and want you to start right away, you could use your dilemma during negotiations. Mention that you would be giving up a severance package if you leave your other job before the end of the year … but if there’s room to increase their salary offer, that would make your decision easier.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2qr300223b77y4r46chf@published"&gt;If you decide to stay in your current job, you could use these overtures to push for more information or opportunities. Tell your boss you appreciate his honesty about the company going out of business. Say you’d like to stay to the end, and you have not been looking for a job, but you have been approached by potential future employers. If Mr. Snap Decisions looks like he’s about to blow a gasket, backtrack by telling him you just thought he deserved to know that competitors are taking an interest in his employees, and cut the conversation short.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="116" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2qr400233b77jtf1tt3d@published"&gt;But assuming your current employer doesn’t want to lose you, this would be a natural time to ask for more information about the severance package, and to get it in writing. The company is understaffed, and closing down a business is complicated, so there might be opportunities for you to take on interesting new responsibilities and develop different skills. Tell your boss you’re hoping to make the most of the next few months in the job and you’d like to find out more about what you can contribute. You might even be able to get a new title by the end that could help you get a job at the next level, wherever you land next.&lt;/p&gt;

I was offered a new job, and I am two weeks in. It is in the realm of what I want to be doing. My stress levels aren’t as high, and I don’t fear working in an unsafe environment.&lt;/p&gt;

I am struggling with feeling as though I’ve become a babysitter to the older residents who are residing there while receiving medical care. That is not part of the job description. They have aides, they are just not always present in the areas where I am assigned, but the aides should be around at all times due to the fall risks of some of the residents.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2xic002i3b77lw85vfj2@published"&gt;Well, the inevitable happened. An unmonitored resident fell while I was leading a program. I felt awful. They couldn’t speak to answer questions, which made matters worse. English is also not their first language. I spent my entire day off ruminating on what happened and thinking about whether I should be working here. I never received a reply or feedback from my supervisor after I messaged them about what happened. Any advice? I know looking for another workplace is a great solution, but it took me a year to land this job.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2xic002l3b770j610v2i@published"&gt;Congratulations on getting out of your terrible last job and finding this new one. The learning curve for any new job can be steep and unsettling. It’s natural to ruminate on work problems, especially at the start. Give yourself time to understand the workplace better, and give yourself grace to know you’re doing your best in an imperfect environment. Be patient with yourself and your co-workers as you learn this new job while still recovering from the trauma of the old one.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="161" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2xid002m3b77lrj77qfg@published"&gt;As a new hire, you’ll naturally have a lot of questions. Ask your supervisor for a check-in after your first few weeks. Don’t mention their lack of response to your message; your supervisor might have too many messages to monitor, and you don’t want to set them up to be defensive. Instead, say you want to make sure you understand your responsibilities and proper procedures. Among other things, you want to know how you can help protect the residents if they’re unaccompanied. (Avoid the word “babysitter,” which sounds disrespectful.) If their aides aren’t present, should you alert your supervisor? Or the aides’ supervisor? Go seek the aides out yourself? Or should you monitor residents when they’re participating in one of your programs? If this responsibility wasn’t in your job description, well, job descriptions are often incomplete, and you need to know what’s really expected of you before you make any decisions about whether to stay, go, or stay and fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2xif002n3b778yq5jume@published"&gt;If the residents aren’t being cared for properly, the problem could be a poor policy, imperfect enforcement of good policies, or a lack of awareness about the policies. In any of these cases, you might be noticing problems with your fresh eyes that long-time employees overlook.&lt;/p&gt;

Yaranov said he spends "a long time indoors," which can contribute to vitamin D deficiency. When he learned his levels were low, he added vitamin D to his list of daily supplements.&lt;/p&gt;

He’s not had the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which isn’t recommended until age 1. When Martin has to return to work, her husband will need to take several unpaid days off to stay home with the boy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f13e9b" class="body-graf"&gt;“It just makes me so mad that this is happening,” said Martin, 26, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. “It’s scary because my son is not protected, and I’m having to worry about child care and my job and my husband’s job.” In these situations, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/measles/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends&lt;/a&gt; quarantine for 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-06fcbd" class="body-graf"&gt;Because he’s too young for the measles vaccine, Hal needed emergency shots of immunoglobulin, or IG, an antibody that helps the immune system fight off infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-76da3c" class="body-graf"&gt;At this point, Martin said, “it’s just a waiting game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4c2628" class="body-graf"&gt;Her family’s worry and frustration are playing out in households nationwide as the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-cases-reach-highest-point-disease-was-eliminated-us-2000-rcna201421" target="_blank"&gt;number of measles cases has surpassed a level&lt;/a&gt; not seen since the highly contagious virus was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a759e8" class="body-graf"&gt;On Wednesday, the CDC reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;1,309 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; in 39 states. The vast majority of patients are children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e7f320" class="body-graf"&gt;Each of those cases has had the opportunity to expose hundreds or even thousands of other people, especially kids, either too young to be vaccinated, like Hal, or children with weak immune systems, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af4654" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician at Texas Tech Physicians in Lubbock, Texas, cared for many families during the recent &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-west-texas-grows-unvaccinated-rcna192163" target="_blank"&gt;measles outbreak in West Texas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e41b0b" class="body-graf"&gt;"A lot of our families, hard-working families, typically don't have a month's savings of salary to stay home, yet they have to," Montanez said. "Oftentimes it's not just one job, but two, maybe three."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd465b" class="body-graf"&gt;Cedar Rapids isn’t experiencing an outbreak of measles. Just &lt;a href="https://www.linncountyiowa.gov/1777/Measles#" target="_blank"&gt;seven cases have been confirmed&lt;/a&gt; across Iowa in 2025, according to the latest data in the state. They are the first reported measles cases in Iowa since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6d63eb" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, the Martin family’s situation illustrates the ripple effects of a single exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b56e5e" class="body-graf"&gt;“What’s happening in our town is a perfect example of why vaccination is important,” said Dr. Dustin Arnold, chief medical officer at UnityPoint Health-Cedar Rapids. “It just takes one” measles case, he said, to set off waves of impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-035921" class="body-graf"&gt;On Saturday, Arnold ran a command center giving out immunoglobulin, or IG shots for eight babies who were exposed to measles at the same day care as Hal. Three others were sent to a nearby medical facility for the same treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-052e01" class="body-graf"&gt;IG injections can be given up to six days after exposure to measles. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8675579/" target="_blank"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; found that the therapy is highly effective in protecting exposed newborns from getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-205a8a" class="body-graf"&gt;IG treatments aren’t a permanent fix, said Dr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Children “develop much higher levels of immunity from vaccination than from immunoglobulin,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-262dd2" class="body-graf"&gt;The Cedar Rapids IG clinics, led by Arnold, were pulled together at the very last minute. The babies who got the injections had been exposed six days earlier, on Monday, July 7. Families were notified late Friday, July 11, and the treatments started the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0b4c4c" class="body-graf"&gt;“There are infants out there who have no protection, and we don’t want them to get sick,” Arnold said. “Measles can be mild, but it can also be life-threatening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a6b370" class="body-graf"&gt;The majority of measles patients have fared well despite their illness. Still, 13%, or 164 patients, needed to be hospitalized because of the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-739ffb" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Three people — including two young girls in Texas — have &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/second-measles-death-texas-child-kennedy-rcna199882" target="_blank"&gt;died of measles this year&lt;/a&gt;.

And just the basic infrastructure – the clean water available to health facilities, the electricity availability to health facilities – is totally destroyed,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Disease outbreaks in Sudan tend to affect people who have “lost your safe place, your home, your protection, however modest that might be”, and find themselves in camps or temporary accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“When that is coupled with an already vulnerable child who is not vaccinated, the vulnerability is compounded,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Diseases that can be prevented with vaccination, &lt;a href="https://www.msf.org/children-darfur-sudan-urgently-need-immunisation-measles-spreads" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;including measles&lt;/a&gt;, not only kill but can leave survivors with long-term complications, Hailegebriel said, adding that these were “children who are robbed of their future”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c7fd21c4-c605-4d76-9027-401836b87c03" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A measles jab is given by a Médecins Sans Frontières nurse in Jebel Marra.

It opens the door to deadly disease outbreaks and puts even more pressure on health systems that are already stretched,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;And while access to vaccination remains the main issue worldwide, “we’re extremely concerned about mis- and disinformation because of the threat it has to worsen the situation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="42429190-609d-4993-bc5e-9300eaad5bd0" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A vaccination centre in Kassala state in July.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Mohammed Abdulmajid/Unicef&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;O’Brien said she expected cuts to aid funding to affect vaccine coverage in future years, with countries struggling to raise domestic finance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Humanitarian efforts had succeeded in boosting vaccination rates in the first half of this year in Sudan, said Hailegebriel, but Unicef’s appeal for the country remained unfunded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The charity has shipped in containers to rebuild the country’s “&lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/supply/what-cold-chain" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cold chain&lt;/a&gt;”, vital for keeping vaccines and other essential medicines at the right temperature so they remain effective on the journey from factory to patient.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some foods seem high in carbs but are actually fiber-rich and blood sugar-friendly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watermelon, edamame and raspberries, among other foods, are lower in carbs than you might expect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating nutrient-dense carbs can support energy, fullness, and overall well-being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/carbohydrates-8423291" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Carbohydrates often get a bad rap&lt;/a&gt;, but they’re an essential part of a balanced diet and your body’s main source of energy. And while carbs aren’t the enemy, some foods carry a reputation for being high in carbs—even when they’re not. Whether you’re paying closer attention to your carb intake for health reasons or are simply curious about what’s in your food, it can be helpful to know that some foods are lower in carbs than you might expect. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, not all foods with carbs have the same impact on your overall health. For instance, while potatoes and pasta are high in carbs, they also contain other nutrients that benefit your health, setting them apart from less nutritious high-carb foods like ice cream and cookies. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; From sweet fruits to starchy-looking veggies, here are eight foods that may not be as high in carbs as you thought—and easy, delicious ways to enjoy them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-carrots"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Carrots &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Due to their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;natural sweetness&lt;/a&gt;, carrots “get unfairly labeled as too sugary, but a cup [raw] only has around 12 grams of carbs,” says &lt;a href="https://nutritionresolution.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alyssa Simpson, RDN, CGN, CLT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s only 4% of the Daily Value for carbohydrates, which is 275 grams per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Not only that, they’re packed with beta-carotene, a powerful antioxidant that helps fight inflammation and may lower the risk of chronic disease like type 2 diabetes, notes Simpson.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-popcorn"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Popcorn &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Popcorn might surprise, since many popular snack options tend to be pretty high in carbs. Unlike many other snacks, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287900/is-popcorn-good-for-weight-loss/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;popcorn is low in carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; and high in fiber. A 3-cup serving has only 15 grams of carbs and up to 4 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “That’s double the fiber than a handful of potato chips for the same carbohydrates,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaitlin-hippley/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Kaitlin Hippley, M.Ed, RDN, LD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. The fiber in popcorn helps slow down digestion and prevent a post-snack spike in blood sugar. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-green-peas"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Green Peas &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While peas are sometimes grouped with higher-carb foods, they deserve a closer look. “A lot of people avoid peas because they think they’re super starchy, but a half cup only has about 12 grams of carbs,” says Simpson.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s much less than other legumes. For instance, black beans have nearly twice that—around 21 grams of carbs in the same serving size.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You’ll also get 4 grams of fiber, plus &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291111/the-10-best-vegan-protein-sources/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based protein&lt;/a&gt; and nutrients like vitamin K and magnesium, both of which support heart and metabolic health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-watermelon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Watermelon &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fruit contains natural sugars, but that doesn’t mean it’s off-limits or necessarily packed with carbs. For example,  a cup of diced watermelon delivers just 11 grams of carbs and plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-vitamin-c-8546809" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; and lycopene—two potent antioxidants that may help protect you against chronic disease, including heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, watermelon is also about 90% water, making it hydrating and refreshing on hot days.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-cottage-cheese"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Cottage Cheese &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like other foods, dairy products are a natural source of carbohydrates. And they contain lactose, a natural sugar, but that doesn’t mean they are all high in carbs. Cottage cheese is a standout, with only 6 grams of carbs per half-cup and nearly 12 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  “It’s great for blood sugar balance and keeps you full—plus, you can go sweet or savory with it,” says Simpson.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-baby-corn"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Baby Corn &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to foods high in carbs, most people will include corn on their list. “While mature corn [like corn on the cob] contains a modest amount of carbohydrates, baby corn has much less,” says &lt;a href="https://www.diabetesteam.com/writers/683f0deb46c7aa1e0f3349e2" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Avery Zenker, BASc, MAN&lt;/a&gt;. An ear of corn provides 10 grams of carbs, whereas a half-cup of baby corn has just 4 grams of carbs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike most beans, such as pinto and black, edamame (young soybeans) are significantly lower in this nutrient. A half-cup contains just 7 grams of carbs, plus 9 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Its fiber-protein combo helps stabilize blood sugar and promote satiety.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These nutrient-rich foods are easy to include in everyday meals. Here are a few ideas:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go Meatless More Often:&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t be afraid of the carbs in beans&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;They provide a combination of protein and fiber that can help stabilize blood sugar levels&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Use fiber- and protein-rich edamame and green peas as the star of meatless meals. For instance, toss edamame into grain bowls or salads or add green peas to risottos, pastas or quick veggie soups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snack Smart: &lt;/strong&gt;Many packaged snacks can be high in carbs and added sugars, but options like cottage cheese, raspberries or popcorn can satisfy without causing blood sugar spikes. While you can snack on them on their own, you can also get creative. Top cottage cheese with raspberries and chopped walnuts. Add a pinch of chili powder or cinnamon to flavor your popcorn. Or blend raspberries into smoothies or freeze them into yogurt barks. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upgrade Your Stir-Fries: &lt;/strong&gt;Vegetables like carrots and baby corn add crunch and vibrant color to any stir-fry, without a ton of carbs. Use carrot ribbons in place of noodles or stir-fry rounds with broccoli and tofu. Baby corn pairs well with mushrooms, peppers, and a light soy-ginger sauce. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You don’t need to fear carbs—especially when they come packaged with fiber, protein and beneficial nutrients. Some foods that are often assumed to be high in carbohydrates actually have less than they appear to have. Rather than cutting out entire food groups, focus on choosing nutrient-dense ingredients that help you feel your best. These eight foods are a great place to start: they’re satisfying, versatile and far more blood sugar-friendly than their reputations suggest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So go ahead—enjoy that popcorn, toss some peas into your stir-fry or scoop up cottage cheese with your favorite toppings.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROCHESTER, Minn. — We often hear how AI is impacting jobs and industries, and not always in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's a story about how artificial intelligence is helping the medical world in ways that we likely never imagined. It is changing lives, just ask Joanie and Dave Kraus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anything is possible, and she’s definitely got a second chance at life,” says Dave.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave is talking about their daughter Jorie. The Krauses spent a long time trying to get pregnant and ultimately were able to conceive Jorie through IVF. They thought they had cleared the hurdle. Getting pregnant was the hard part, right? The couple thought health issues were in the clear as genetic testing was done as part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At our 20-week scan, they found out that she was a little bit small and they found an undefined heart issue. They didn't quite know what it was, and so we prayed for wisdom, and we went to Mayo for a second opinion,” says Joanie.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joanie, we should note, was a long-time KARE 11 employee, managing our sales department until recently.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 33 weeks, the doctors at Mayo decided a cesarean section (C-section) was the best option, and Jorie Kraus was welcomed into the world.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They immediately ended up putting her into one of those incubator things and shipped her off over to St. Mary's campus where I met her over there and Joanie stayed at the Mayo side of the campus and I had both women in my life in two different buildings and trying to split time with both and keep them both ok,” Dave recalls.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jorie went on to spend 73 days in the NICU. It turned out she had not one but five heart issues, among some other physical anomalies, but nothing that couldn't be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How are we going to fix it, and how are we going to address it? And this wonderful surgeon said, 'Hey, don't worry about it. We're going to figure this all out. You just need to worry about who she's taking to prom,'" says Joanie.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joanie and Dave allowed themselves to exhale. But it's not where their baby girl's story ends. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing came back showing a problem. Jorie was missing part of her chromosome 10. A spontaneous deletion during pregnancy, meaning it was not inherited from either parent, which is why it wasn't caught during the IVF process. Jorie was diagnosed with DeSanto-Shinawi Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that was the cause of her physical issues but would also cause low muscle tone, developmental delays and intellectual disabilities. At the time, just a couple dozen people in the world had the same diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Joanie was asking a little bit about what does that mean? And I just sort of piped up and said, 'That means it's permanent. There's nothing with this one. This one doesn't have a fix. This one doesn't have a surgery,' and that's when I had to get up and leave the room," Dave said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no cure, early interventions, like physical and speech therapies, were the only options. A year passed, and as Jorie fell behind with her milestones like crawling and talking, Joanie and Dave pushed forward, fighting for answers.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We're at the best hospital in the world. Where's the groundbreaking genetic research? And she had this big smile. This big, big smile and she goes, 'Have you met Dr. Whitney Thompson?'”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had, in fact, met Dr. Thompson. She was working in the NICU when they ordered the genetic testing or rapid genome sequencing for Jorie right after birth. And since that time, Thompson had started a new project with Dr. Laura Lambert called BabyForce.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We can send this comprehensive genetic test Day One in the NICU and get a diagnosis within that first week of life, and it can really make a huge difference for patients, but often we get the diagnosis, but we don't have a treatment, and that's really where Babyforce comes in," says Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors take a patient's skin cells and grow them in a lab. Using Artificial intelligence, they search for already FDA-approved drugs that could potentially help. Then they test them on the patient's lab-grown cells to see if it works.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Taking a drug that is already approved, and already known to be safe, and known to have a safety profile in children, really circumvents all of those issues that the rare disease population faces. So, we don't have to have that major investment into running a clinical trial because it's off-label use,” says Lambert.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Jorie, the top hit from AI was an inexpensive drug commonly used to treat seizures in children. In the lab, it worked like a charm, boosting the levels of her working chromosome to compensate for the deleted one. Since the concept is so new, they had to go through ethics and legal departments first. Jorie just started taking the medicine a few months ago. Turns out, it is working like a charm in real life, too.  Within days, Jorie started walking with a walker, going up and down stairs, and even starting to say words.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's like she was getting the information and understanding it but just couldn't figure out what to do with it, and now she's starting to figure out what to do with it,” says Joanie. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A treatment for an ultra-rare disease would normally take years—if at all. The success in Jorie's case opens a door of hope for others in the future.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We're focused on the NICU because, certainly, the earlier we intervene, potentially the more impact we can have on somebody's life, and the hope is we can move that timeline up even more, and start treating before symptoms even develop," says Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know this could benefit patients who are born with genetic differences, but it also has applications for cancer, for example, where we could sequence an individual's tumor and understand what's causing the cancer and look for drugs using AI to try to have an impact for those patients as well,” adds Lambert.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endless possibilities. Which is also what these doctors have given Jorie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"She's going to be the best Jorie she can be. The barriers have been lifted for her," says Dave. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“She's just such a joy, and you know, we just hope that out of all of the hardship that we went through and all that she has gone through, that it will be a beacon of hope to others,” says Joanie.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it’s the reason they are sharing their story, to pay it forward. None of this process was covered by insurance. It was all funding from Mayo and private donors. The Krauses have started both a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-the-jorie-effect-hope-for-rare-diseases"&gt;GoFundme&lt;/a&gt; and a charity called &lt;a href="https://www.thejorieeffect.com/"&gt;The Jorie Effect&lt;/a&gt; to help other children with rare diseases have access to this kind of medical care.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thompson and Lambert have already presented their findings at several medical gatherings and will publish their work and findings at the end of July.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A drug widely used to treat nerve pain and epilepsy has been linked with an increase in cases of dementia and mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Arizona State University, and the MetroHealth Medical Center in the US crunched the numbers on 26,416 records of patients with chronic &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-simple-exercise-is-an-overlooked-solution-to-lower-back-pain"&gt;lower back pain&lt;/a&gt;, looking at the relationship between prescriptions for the anticonvulsant &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabapentin"&gt;gabapentin&lt;/a&gt; and dementia diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having six or more gabapentin prescriptions was linked to a significant increase in dementia risk and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mild_cognitive_impairment"&gt;mild cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; (MCI), the data showed: those in that group were 29 percent and 85 percent more likely to be diagnosed with dementia and MCI respectively, within 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-study-links-15-factors-to-early-dementia-risk?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massive Study Links 15 Factors to Early Dementia Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase was higher among patients aged between 35 and 49, and also rose with the number of prescriptions given, the researchers found. Though the study can't establish a cause for the increase, physicians are encouraged to keep a close eye on patients taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gabapentin prescription in adults with chronic low back pain is associated with increased risk of dementia and cognitive impairment, particularly in non-elderly adults," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/rapm-2025-106577"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Physicians should monitor cognitive outcomes in patients prescribed gabapentin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sold under brand names including Neurontin, gabapentin has proved to be less addictive &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/opioids-watched-in-real-time-as-they-work-deep-inside-the-brain"&gt;than opioids&lt;/a&gt;, making it more likely to be prescribed in recent years. The drug does have some known side effects though, including extreme moods and allergic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time researchers have examined associations between gabapentin and dementia, but previous studies &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2024.05.031"&gt;haven't agreed&lt;/a&gt; on whether or not concerns are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167804" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167804" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/GabapentinTablets.jpg" alt="Gabapentin tablets" class="wp-image-167804 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/GabapentinTablets.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/GabapentinTablets-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167804" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Gabapentin is a commonly prescribed medication for pain relief and epilepsy.

A study published in 1997 found no link between gabapentin and cognitive decline in people with epilepsy, so it's important to continue to widen the data set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conflicting results could suggest unique mechanisms among patients with the type of backpain that leads to a gabapentin prescription that also increases their risk of dementia, like a certain type of location of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But gabapentin works by dampening some of the brain's key communication channels, in order to provide relief from pain or make seizures less likely. So the worry is that it could also be damaging links between neurons in ways that might lead to dementia – a concern backed up by this latest study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is a challenging condition to study with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dementia-risk-can-be-cut-by-45-if-together-we-do-these-14-things"&gt;so many potential factors&lt;/a&gt; to account for, but each study gets us closer to the full picture of how the brain breaks down over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope the current study promotes further research to delineate whether gabapentin plays a causal role in the development of dementia and the underlying mechanisms of this relationship," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/rapm-2025-106577"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/rapm-2025-106577"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regional Anesthesia &amp;amp; Pain Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder, with as many &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/2249-4863.201153"&gt;as a third&lt;/a&gt; of adults reporting problems with it. A new study suggests four low-effort, low-cost types of exercise that could help ensure a more restful night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data on 1,348 individuals from 22 separate randomized controlled trials were pulled together to look for associations between exercise types and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-reportedly-cured-73-of-insomniacs-with-a-simple-one-hour-treatment"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;. All kinds of exercise were linked to less severe insomnia, but yoga, Tai Chi, walking, and jogging were found to be most helpful of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're all types of activity that are fairly easy to do and don't have to cost you anything, and could be options &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-could-be-multiple-kinds-of-insomnia-all-requiring-different-treatments"&gt;for insomnia sufferers&lt;/a&gt; to explore alongside other medical advice – even if direct cause and effect can't be shown, according to the researchers from institutions across China and Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-to-live-to-100-these-four-habits-might-help-get-you-there?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Want to Live to 100? These Four Habits Might Help Get You There.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Specifically, yoga may increase sleep duration, Tai Chi may enhance sleep architecture with lasting benefits, and walking or jogging may alleviate daytime dysfunction," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2024-113512"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These insights could inform personalized treatment approaches and guide the development of future clinical guidelines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between more exercise and better sleep &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-better-sleep-this-one-piece-of-advice-seems-to-work-for-almost-everybody"&gt;is a well established one&lt;/a&gt;, and in that respect the study results aren't surprising. However, what's useful here is the detailed look at exercise types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168123" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168123" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SleepChart.jpg" alt="Sleep treatments" class="wp-image-168123 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SleepChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SleepChart-610x415.jpg 610w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SleepChart-600x408.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168123" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers analyzed a range of potential treatments for insomnia. (Bu et al., &lt;em&gt;BMJ Evid. Based Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the reviewed trials weren't fully consistent in terms of their methods or durations, the researchers were able to compare the effects of exercise on insomnia against approaches such as &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt/"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; (CBT), massage, acupuncture, improving sleep hygiene, and doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tai Chi, sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-health-benefits-of-tai-chi"&gt;described as&lt;/a&gt; 'meditation in motion' and originating from China, showed more long-term benefits than other approaches. It was associated with improved sleep quality, being able to get to sleep quicker, and 50 minutes more sleep time on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also explored some of the reasons why these links might exist. Walking and jogging increases energy expenditure and boosts the production of the sleep hormone melatonin, for example, while yoga is known for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-ancient-activity-is-rumored-to-boost-your-longevity-but-is-it-true"&gt;relaxing the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yoga has significantly affected subjective sleep quality, likely due to its focus on body awareness, controlled breathing and attentional training," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2024-113512"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Neurophysiological evidence indicates that yoga may enhance GABAergic activity and inhibit amygdala hyperactivation, thereby alleviating anxiety and depressive symptoms that often impair sleep initiation and perception."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, part of the concern around insomnia is that it can lead to so many other health issues as well: people who struggle to get enough shut-eye during the night tend to be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sleep-disturbances-linked-with-higher-dementia-risk-study-finds"&gt;more likely to develop dementia&lt;/a&gt;, for example – though that could be due to medications or other factors, as well as the insomnia itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to reduce the severity of insomnia could thus reduce the risk of other problems, as well as improving day-to-day quality of life – &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/most-of-us-hit-snooze-but-what-is-it-actually-doing-to-us"&gt;waking up more refreshed&lt;/a&gt; and not dozing off during afternoon meetings, for instance. The findings here could be useful for both insomnia sufferers and health professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The findings will offer valuable guidance for clinicians and help patients to choose the most appropriate exercise methods for managing their insomnia," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2024-113512"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2024-113512"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

While it’s true that you’re not alone if you’re struggling with chronic exhaustion, like &lt;a href="https://www.psu.edu/news/hershey/story/medical-minute-why-am-i-always-so-tired" rel="nofollow"&gt;physical exhaustion, Dr. Katelynn Sheaffer&lt;/a&gt; suggests, there is a diverse range of culprits that could be keeping you in this unhealthy cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From sleep patterns to eating habits and even screen-time usage, several things keep people feeling tired in their daily lives, no matter what’s going on in their routines. Many of the things you’ll always find in the home of someone who’s constantly tired are representative of these causes, so if you’re struggling, consider addressing these random and unsuspecting items first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here are 11 things you’ll always find in the home of someone who’s constantly tired:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. A phone charger right next to the bed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-07/things-youll-always-find-in-the-home-of-someone-constantly-tired-phone-charger.png" alt="Man with a phone charger on his nightstand sitting in the dark." title="phone charger nightstand things you'll always find in the home of someone who's constantly tired " class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Gorodenkoff | Shutterstock.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A charger on the nightstand, and more specifically, constant access to their phone right from bed, is one of the things you’ll always find in the home of someone who’s constantly tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are chronically exhausted and fatigued throughout the day almost always wake up that way. Their sleep patterns aren’t great; they’re not getting enough sleep, and they wake up feeling drained and anxious. So, what’s the primary motivator behind this lack of quality and duration of sleep? Experts believe it’s their phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7010281/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;a study from PLOS ONE&lt;/a&gt;, scrolling on your phone before bed every night keeps your brain in a state of constant arousal and stress, making it harder to fall asleep and more challenging to wake up feeling rested. Of course, it’s not always convenient to set an alarm on your phone and put it away from your bed, but doing so can forcefully cultivate time — both in the morning and at night — for your brain to settle without added pressure from a phone screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/master-bedtime-habits-remain-happy-into-old-age"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experts Say If You Can Master These 12 Pre-Bedtime Habits, You'll Remain Happy Into Your 80s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

Water bottles next to a bed are a common sight in the homes of people who are constantly tired, as they often drink so much water that they wake up at night and disrupt their sleep cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may seem unsuspecting, but the more intentional you are with food and water consumption before bed, the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/wild-sleep-facts-explain-why-youre-still-tired-no-matter-what"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Wild Sleep Facts That Explain Why You’re Still Tired No Matter What&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3.

Not only do warmer temperatures when we’re trying to sleep make it harder to comfortably fall asleep, but they also often disrupt our body’s cooling mechanisms that allow us to stay asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why a warm bedroom or a thermostat set about 70 degrees Fahrenheit are some of the things you’ll always find in the home of someone who’s constantly tired. They’re not only getting bad quality sleep — being woken up and disrupted every hour — they’re also not getting enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/habit-well-rested-people-use-fall-asleep-quickly"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The One Habit Well-Rested People Use To Fall Asleep In Minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4.

If we’re not waking up naturally from light or sounds in the morning, it may be harder to truly wake up feeling refreshed and energized simply from the sound of an abrupt alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s one of the things you’ll always find in the home of someone who’s constantly tired, because rather than changing their habits, work-life boundaries, or diets, they instead opt for “quick fixes” that keep them stuck in a cycle of exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-youre-burned-out-not-lazy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 Signs You're Burned Out, Not Lazy — According To Psychology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10.

Called DCD, or donation after circulatory death, it involves a controversial recovery technique or the use of expensive machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-81f85b" class="body-graf"&gt;Surgeons at Duke and Vanderbilt universities reported Wednesday that they've separately devised simpler approaches to retrieve those hearts. In the New England Journal of Medicine, they described successfully transplanting hearts to a 3-month-old infant at Duke and three men at Vanderbilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3173b6" class="body-graf"&gt;"These DCD hearts work just as well as hearts from brain-dead donors," said Vanderbilt lead author Dr. Aaron M. Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-2b655c" class="body-heading"&gt;How hearts are saved for donation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a30fb7" class="body-graf"&gt;Most transplanted hearts come from donors who are brain dead. In those situations, the body is left on a ventilator that keeps the heart beating until the organs are removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ca0f4f" class="body-graf"&gt;Circulatory death occurs when someone has a nonsurvivable brain injury but because all brain function hasn't ceased, the family decides to withdraw life support and the heart stops. That means organs can spend a while without oxygen before being recovered, a time lag usually doable for kidneys and other organs but that can raise questions about the quality of hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-943528" class="body-graf"&gt;To counter damage and determine whether DCD organs are usable, surgeons can pump blood and oxygen to the deceased donor's abdominal and chest organs — after clamping off access to the brain. But it's ethically controversial to artificially restore circulation even temporarily and some hospitals prohibit that technique, called normothermic regional perfusion, or NRP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1829aa" class="body-graf"&gt;Another option is to "reanimate" DCD organs in a machine that pumps blood and nutrients on the way to the transplant hospital. The machines are expensive and complex, and Duke's Dr. Joseph Turek said the devices can't be used for young children's small hearts — the age group with the most dire need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-619ae5" class="body-heading"&gt;New ways of preserving hearts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5512a" class="body-graf"&gt;Turek's team found a middle ground: Remove the heart and attach some tubes of oxygen and blood to briefly assess its ability to function — not in a machine but on a sterile table in the operating room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7cd2d8" class="body-graf"&gt;They practiced with piglets. Then came the real test. At another hospital, life support was about to be withdrawn from a 1-month-old whose family wanted to donate — and who would be a good match for a 3-month-old Duke patient in desperate need of a new heart. The other hospital didn't allow the controversial NRP recovery technique but let Turek's team test the experimental alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fe0b09" class="body-graf"&gt;It took just five minutes to tell "the coronary arteries are filling well, it's pink, it's beating," Turek said. The team promptly put the little heart on ice and raced it back to Duke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9336a1" class="body-graf"&gt;Vanderbilt's system is even simpler: Infuse the heart with a nutrient-rich, cold preservative solution before removing it from the donor's body, similar to how hearts from brain-dead donors are handled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-43243a" class="body-graf"&gt;That "replenishes the nutrients that are depleted during the dying process and helps protect it for transport," Williams explained, adding that Vanderbilt has performed about 25 such transplants so far. "Our view is you don't necessarily need to reanimate the heart."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-f8f1d3" class="body-heading"&gt;More donated hearts are needed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-842207" class="body-graf"&gt;There's a huge need for more transplantable hearts. Hundreds of thousands of adults suffer from advanced heart failure, yet many are never even offered a transplant because of the organ shortage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7ce34a" class="body-graf"&gt;Every year about 700 children in the U.S. are added to the transplant list for a new heart and about 20% die waiting. Turek said infants are at particular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a84dc0" class="body-graf"&gt;Last year, people whose lives ended via circulatory death made up 43% of the nation's deceased donors — but just 793 of the 4,572 heart transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2d327d" class="body-graf"&gt;That's why many specialists say finding ways to use more of those hearts is crucial. The new studies are small and early-stage but promising, said Brendan Parent of NYU Langone Health, who directs transplant ethics and policy research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-be3b13" class="body-graf"&gt;"Innovation to find ways to recover organs successfully after circulatory death are essential for reducing the organ shortage," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-acf620" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;If alternatives pan out, "I absolutely think that cardiac programs will be thrilled, especially at hospitals that have rejected NRP."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 00:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxOT2lhU1g3RXBxS1BYMHFCdDJoNXZ1M1R0V2g0REE2ZTNGeTJBanJCUVUzdlJRRWc4UkVETUI4R05DWm1jdDh0NkstYWM1MFdHN3VBMUgyQ2hLaUNCaUxWQmRzVzIyQUU1TW9sbTU4OFNsV2lZQVg3S09jWS05T1JmaE5ZeG8tZlZuaWRlRGFia1BldDVQNjRPWEVOYnlEV2NBN0ZnanBuRkNhVVZP0gFWQVVfeXFMTWFaaUNBOUw3QXlJVnFfbXh0aVd1WnNVS2F4RFExclYteFBwTTkzWVNoVDRHUDhjWnRkbEpiVHJuN1cwTi1WZFJGNTg4RG02OW1QX0diMmc</guid></item><item><title>30年代心脏病的5种无声症状-印度时报 | 5 silent symptoms of heart trouble in the 30s - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2gFBVV95cUxQblN6d0hfZ1J1cG5HRHo3MlJndHhNWWdoOHU1VVRyb09ydnNWU2FDc3BaWnI0V2hkaTlYU241dDJWUlBIRXRUNE4wTFJJV1BmYlRKTEFGUFUybF8wQlQxUm5ENmlUSmZKZHdnU0pJLXVJRVMxNzRXZWVJTkdrRlEyeEw5Z0xPazFFYmlnQlRXUzRNd1A3OWx6dnA1RjI0MGlhenVpWUt5V211UjBnNzdzM2Z1ZHozc01qVXMtcnEtemY3RndKX1BzeGFyTVB6c2V1cVBfTnVGNk9sdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dizziness and faintness, especially when moving quickly or exercising, could signal heart problems.

Packed with protein, essential vitamins, and minerals, eggs are a nutritional powerhouse, but do they harm your heart? French biochemist Jessie Inchauspé, author of the bestselling books Glucose Revolution and The Glucose Goddess Method, has weighed in on whether eggs harm the heart. Inchauspé, who is known for her evidence-based approach to nutrition, has detailed the real impact of eggs on heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Eggs are a nutritional powerhouse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I eat 3 to 4 eggs a day... and I know what you're going to say: ‘Aren't eggs bad for your heart?’ So let's set the record straight: eggs are amazing!” she said, in a video shared on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are nutritious. An egg contains 78 calories, 6 grams of protein, and 5 grams of fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single large boiled egg contains: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin A: 8% of the DV (daily value)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Folate: 6% of the DV&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5): 14% of the DV&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin B12: 23% of the DV&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Riboflavin (vitamin B2): 20% of the DV&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Phosphorus: 7% of the DV&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Selenium: 28% of the DV&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eggs also contain decent amounts of vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin B6, calcium, and zinc&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Are eggs bad for the heart? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People tend to associate eggs with heart disease due to their cholesterol content. According to the biochemist, the cholesterol in eggs does not pose a significant risk to cardiovascular health. “Cholesterol in eggs is not damaging,” she &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLh3H8eIQxm/?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, adding that one does not have to be worried about eating eggs. “I have eggs every single day. There doesn't need to be a limit on how many eggs you consume.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inchauspé notes that the culprit behind heart disease is not the eggs, but the glucose dysregulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So there are a few different hypotheses in the world of heart disease, but now things are starting to get a bit clearer. It's a two-factor approach. The first factor for heart disease is small, dense LDL particles of cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second factor for heart disease, inflammation and oxidation of particles in your bloodstream,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Eating an egg a day: Is it good or bad for your heart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What can be done &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For centuries, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/how-many-eggs-should-you-eat-per-day-latest-research-has-surprising-answers/articleshow/122331002.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have been looked upon with doubt due to their cholesterol content. However, now the focus has shifted to managing blood sugar and reducing inflammation rather than avoiding cholesterol-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to reduce heart disease risk, the scientist recommends cutting back on sugar intake. “So, how do we avoid having unhealthy fats in our blood, and how do we avoid oxidation? The first thing we need to do is reduce sugar because sugar and high insulin, and high glucose levels, and fructose in the body will make both of those things worse. It will prompt your liver to produce small particle LDL, and it'll oxidize particles in your bloodstream,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggJBVV95cUxPOGk0bGMtMjJQWE81bnk0VndRQ1R5TXg2cjVBLTZVUkFCbHJMaThkWTJMNjkwakNieUhpeXhPMXlnT0dhTFdSbDZudW5hd2NTd3NmS0Qxb3MwbzUyNXJCMndsbmRvcnBURHQzRkhxaVJVSllUTUp2M0FWbnFLYVBKYm5mR2MzR2JtUlhvTDgtYk81YnphN3I4WTZIdzBzaFNFX3RubVlXeWNSdWhmOFhmRUZPNFlHTnBDa1BqSFh0cFh0aTZHYUFSazFaalo3U3huNlQxeDZIZVh5OHd0UXlSanpFeG9rQmxQRW9QdjhDY2ZxWS1EYTd0SlNnWmo1NnE2T3c</guid></item><item><title>在科学家使用三个人的DNA来避免遗传疾病之后，在英国出生的健康婴儿- CNN | Healthy babies born in Britain after scientists used DNA from three people to avoid genetic disease - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTFBNMHg1dExla191NUN0Zi1HX2pLclp3YUNaSnJvMVoxNzJIbURmQkZ1ak5pdlFlWDJpRW13ckJmUDBMclNXWWpTQXhvQWVyOHp5NnAzenlXU2U3NlpkSHJ5bWJqaEZnaEhKZWlHTTBBem5NMzcwdTA40gF8QVVfeXFMUENSeG0tSUNkZi1kb0pqTDBzUVc1SWFDS3lUNlVJZFlqdERCd09WOXlXakJ2YXEzei02dVlndUhWQmJlY1BEeWw2d0V6YkV4LWhVemZYeGRLVERDLV96RENsVlV2OS1mWU9rYU52YVZqZnBnUUM4emd0QXRFdA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Eight healthy babies were born in Britain with the help of an experimental technique that uses DNA from three people to help mothers avoid passing devastating rare diseases to their children, researchers reported Wednesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz00063b6nj1ud8a7h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most DNA is found in the nucleus of our cells, and it’s that genetic material — some inherited from mom, some from dad — that makes us who we are. But there’s also some DNA outside of the cell’s nucleus, in structures called mitochondria. Dangerous mutations there can cause a range of diseases in children that can lead to muscle weakness, seizures, developmental delays, major organ failure and death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz00073b6nbwmlg8dp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Testing during the in vitro fertilization process can usually identify whether these mutations are present. But in rare cases, it’s not clear.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz00083b6nzv1d63kp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers have been developing a technique that tries to avoid the problem by using the healthy mitochondria from a donor egg. They reported in 2023 that the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/britain-genetic-babies-mitochondria-three-parent-6d826809d66a4474bc9dc455c475ad58" target="_blank"&gt;first babies&lt;/a&gt; had been born using this method, where scientists take genetic material from the mother’s egg or embryo, which is then transferred into a donor egg or embryo that has healthy mitochondria but the rest of its key DNA removed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz00093b6n0za4hust@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The latest research “marks an important milestone,” said Dr. Zev Williams, who directs the Columbia University Fertility Center and was not involved in the work. “Expanding the range of reproductive options … will empower more couples to pursue safe and healthy pregnancies.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000a3b6n0nhj9gly@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Using this method means the embryo has &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-9f87d8bbf8cb46b5b811f984ac7bba4e" target="_blank"&gt;DNA from three people&lt;/a&gt; — from the mother’s egg, the father’s sperm and the donor’s mitochondria — and it required a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-parenting-relationships-69d7ed6e2c6b4072b0e3d036ecb939a3" target="_blank"&gt;2016 U.K. law change&lt;/a&gt; to approve it. It is also allowed in Australia but not in many other countries, including the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000b3b6nokpt794d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts at Britain’s Newcastle University and Monash University in Australia reported in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday that they performed the new technique in fertilized embryos from 22 patients, which resulted in eight babies that appear to be free of mitochondrial diseases. One woman is still pregnant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000c3b6nxgwt5h98@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the eight babies born had slightly higher than expected levels of abnormal mitochondria, said Robin Lovell-Badge, a stem cell and developmental genetics scientist at the Francis Crick Institute who was not involved in the research. He said it was still not considered a high enough level to cause disease, but should be monitored as the baby develops.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000d3b6nqgcil7gf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Andy Greenfield, a reproductive health expert at the University of Oxford, called the work “a triumph of scientific innovation,” and said the method of exchanging mitochondria would only be used for a small number of women for whom other ways of avoiding passing on genetic diseases, like testing embryos at an early stage, was not effective.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000e3b6nrtqx45m5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lovell-Badge said the amount of DNA from the donor is insignificant, noting that any resulting child would have no traits from the woman who donated the healthy mitochondria. The genetic material from the donated egg makes up less than 1% of the baby born after this technique.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000f3b6ne3c78ayi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you had a bone marrow transplant from a donor … you will have much more DNA from another person,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In the U.K., every couple seeking a baby born through donated mitochondria must be approved by the country’s fertility regulator. As of this month, 35 patients have been authorized to undergo the technique.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000h3b6n1d2n5b4c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Critics have previously raised concerns, warning that it’s impossible to know the impact these sorts of novel techniques might have on future generations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000i3b6njfcoaipd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Currently, pronuclear transfer is not permitted for clinical use in the U.S., largely due to regulatory restrictions on techniques that result in heritable changes to the embryo,” Williams, of Columbia, said in an email. ”Whether that will change remains uncertain and will depend on evolving scientific, ethical, and policy discussions.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000j3b6npe34y2ff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For about a decade, Congress has included provisions in annual funding bills banning the Food and Drug Administration from accepting applications for clinical research involving techniques, “in which a human embryo is intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic modification.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000k3b6ne84bah9x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in countries where the technique is allowed, advocates say it could provide a promising alternative for some families.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000l3b6nddz7r2e2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Liz Curtis, whose daughter Lily died of a mitochondrial disease in 2006, now works with other families affected by them. She said it was devastating to be told there was no treatment for her eight-month-old baby and that death was inevitable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000m3b6nw6km0s1n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said the diagnosis “turned our world upside down, and yet nobody could tell us very much about it, what it was or how it was going to affect Lily.” Curtis later founded the Lily Foundation in her daughter’s name to raise awareness and support research into the disease, including the latest work done at Newcastle University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6g9iyz000n3b6nlg16vr8m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s super exciting for families that don’t have much hope in their lives,” Curtis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Called DCD, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/heart-transplant-donation-shortage-047da7c0bc9935e98421ad64ec6506bd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:or donation after circulatory death;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;or donation after circulatory death&lt;/a&gt;, it involves a controversial recovery technique or the use of expensive machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Surgeons at Duke and Vanderbilt universities reported Wednesday that they’ve separately devised simpler approaches to retrieve those hearts. In the New England Journal of Medicine, they described successfully transplanting hearts to a 3-month-old infant at Duke and three men at Vanderbilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“These DCD hearts work just as well as hearts from brain-dead donors,” said Vanderbilt lead author Dr. Aaron M. Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;How hearts are saved for donation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most transplanted hearts come from donors who are brain dead. In those situations, the body is left on a ventilator that keeps the heart beating until the organs are removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Circulatory death occurs when someone has a nonsurvivable brain injury but because all brain function hasn’t ceased, the family decides to withdraw life support and the heart stops. That means organs can spend a while without oxygen before being recovered, a time lag usually doable for kidneys and other organs but that can raise questions about the quality of hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To counter damage and determine whether DCD organs are usable, surgeons can pump blood and oxygen to the deceased donor’s abdominal and chest organs — after clamping off access to the brain. But it’s ethically controversial to artificially restore circulation even temporarily and some hospitals prohibit that technique, called normothermic regional perfusion, or NRP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another option is to “reanimate” DCD organs in a machine that pumps blood and nutrients on the way to the transplant hospital. The machines are expensive and complex, and Duke’s Dr. Joseph Turek said the devices can’t be used for young children’s small hearts — the age group with the most dire need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;New ways of preserving hearts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Turek’s team found a middle ground: Remove the heart and attach some tubes of oxygen and blood to briefly assess its ability to function — not in a machine but on a sterile table in the operating room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;They practiced with piglets. Then came the real test. At another hospital, life support was about to be withdrawn from a 1-month-old whose family wanted to donate — and who would be a good match for a 3-month-old Duke patient in desperate need of a new heart. The other hospital didn’t allow the controversial NRP recovery technique but let Turek’s team test the experimental alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It took just five minutes to tell “the coronary arteries are filling well, it’s pink, it’s beating,” Turek said. The team promptly put the little heart on ice and raced it back to Duke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vanderbilt’s system is even simpler: Infuse the heart with a nutrient-rich, cold preservative solution before removing it from the donor’s body, similar to how hearts from brain-dead donors are handled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That “replenishes the nutrients that are depleted during the dying process and helps protect it for transport,” Williams explained, adding that Vanderbilt has performed about 25 such transplants so far. “Our view is you don’t necessarily need to reanimate the heart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More donated hearts are needed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There's a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/science-health-organ-transplants-government-and-politics-308bfae0c70c3377d595b9a0a3a5a381" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:huge need;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;huge need&lt;/a&gt; for more transplantable hearts. Hundreds of thousands of adults suffer from advanced heart failure, yet many are never even offered a transplant because of the organ shortage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Every year about 700 children in the U.S. are added to the transplant list for a new heart and about 20% die waiting. Turek said infants are at particular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Last year, people whose lives ended via circulatory death made up 43% of the nation’s deceased donors — but just 793 of the 4,572 heart transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That's why many specialists say finding ways to use more of those hearts is crucial. The new studies are small and early-stage but promising, said Brendan Parent of NYU Langone Health, who directs transplant ethics and policy research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Innovation to find ways to recover organs successfully after circulatory death are essential for reducing the organ shortage,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If alternatives pan out, “I absolutely think that cardiac programs will be thrilled, especially at hospitals that have rejected NRP.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The fertility regulator granted the first licence in 2017 to a fertility clinic at Newcastle University where doctors pioneered the technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The four boys and four girls, including one set of identical twins, were born to seven women and have no signs of the mitochondrial diseases they were at risk of inheriting. One further pregnancy is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Doug Turnbull, who was part of the team that spent more than two decades developing the procedure, said the healthy births were reassuring for researchers and the families affected. “You are inevitably thinking it’s great for the patients and that is a relief,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Mary Herbert, another senior member of the team, said to have eight healthy babies from the procedure was “rewarding for all of us”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The vast majority of a human’s 20,000 genes are curled up in the nucleus of nearly every cell in the body. But the fluid surrounding the nucleus contains hundreds to thousands of mitochondria that carry their own set of 37 genes. Mutations in these genes can impair or completely disable mitochondria with catastrophic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;People inherit all their mitochondria from their biological mother. Mutations in the tiny battery-like structures can affect all the children a woman has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The first symptoms of mitochondrial disease tend to appear in early childhood as energy-hungry organs such as the brain, heart and muscles start to fail. Many affected children have developmental delays, require wheelchairs and die young. About one in 5,000 newborns are affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Mitochondrial donation treatment, or MDT, aims to prevent children from inheriting mutated mitochondria. The procedure involves fertilising the mother’s egg with the father’s sperm and then transferring the genetic material from the nucleus into a fertilised healthy donor egg that has had its own nucleus removed. This creates a fertilised egg with a full set of chromosomes from the parents, but healthy mitochondria from the donor. The egg is then implanted into the womb to establish a pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/07/vitro-gametogenesisexplainer/giv-32554fs4UJ2dngZD7/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"How mitochondrial donation therapy works","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0},"elementId":"b4098f2c-6bd7-4d48-9618-33fbaf7d0d36","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="b4098f2c-6bd7-4d48-9618-33fbaf7d0d36" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="How mitochondrial donation therapy works" data-testid="interactive-element-How%20mitochondrial%20donation%20therapy%20works" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/07/vitro-gametogenesisexplainer/giv-32554fs4UJ2dngZD7/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;How mitochondrial donation therapy works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The first eight babies born to the procedure are described in &lt;a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2415539" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2503658" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine. All eight were healthy at birth. One child developed a urinary infection that was treated, and another developed muscle jerks that resolved on their own. A third child developed high blood fat and a disturbance in their heart rhythm, which was also treated. The condition is thought to be related to a medical issue the mother had in pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Genetic tests showed that the babies had no or low levels of mutant mitochondria, with some carried over from the mother during the procedure. While the levels are considered too low to cause disease, it suggests the procedure could still be improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“All the children are well and they’re continuing to meet their developmental milestones,” said Bobby McFarland, director of the NHS Highly Specialised Service for Rare Mitochondrial Disorders at Newcastle hospitals NHS foundation trust. Five of the children are less than a year old, two are aged between one and two, and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/09/first-uk-baby-with-dna-from-three-people-born-after-new-ivf-procedure" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the other child is older&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The mother of one of the girls said: “As parents, all we ever wanted was to give our child a healthy start in life. After years of uncertainty this treatment gave us hope – and then it gave us our baby … we’re overwhelmed with gratitude. Science gave us a chance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some women who carry the genetic disorders produce eggs with varying levels of faulty mitochondria. For them, a technique called pre-implantation genetic testing (PGT) can be used to select eggs for IVF that have a very low chance of passing on a disease.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Learning how to make Greek yogurt at home is simple with this easy recipe. Start by making homemade yogurt by heating milk, combining it with a little bit of already-cultured yogurt and letting it sit in a warm spot until the milk turns into yogurt. Making protein-rich Greek yogurt takes one step beyond regular yogurt: straining the yogurt to thicken it. You can add the leftover liquid—also known as whey—to smoothies, or you can use it in place of buttermilk in baking.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Originally from Mesopotamia, farro is a type of wheat with a wonderful nutty flavor and toothsome texture.

Current US childhood vaccine coverage is 95%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite lacking the technological advances of today, these medical interventions represent two of the most successful vaccines ever developed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studies the team conducted in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/62/9/1111/1745278?login=false"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2016&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/72/2/285/5741633?login=false"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggested that the vaccines generate at least 30 years of immunity against the life-threatening infections, far beyond the current 10-year booster recommendations and previous recommendations for even more frequent boosters (eg, every 3 years in 1955). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, childhood vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria have achieved roughly 95% and 99.9% reductions in those diseases, similar to those of other routine pediatric vaccines such as measles (99.9%), mumps (97.6%), and rubella (99.9%), the researchers said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Despite lacking the technological advances of today, these medical interventions represent two of the most successful vaccines ever developed, as indicated by the incidence of disease falling to less than one case of tetanus per 10 million person-years and approximately one case of diphtheria per 1 billion person-years in the U.S. population," they wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;First author Mark Slifka, PhD, of Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University, said in a university &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1090984"&gt;&lt;span&gt;news release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that childhood vaccination has ensured that diphtheria and tetanus are "incredibly rare" today. "In fact, you're 10 to 1,000 times more likely to be struck by lightning than to be diagnosed with tetanus and diphtheria in the United States," he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Closer alignment with WHO guidelines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like the United States, France recommends tetanus and diphtheria booster vaccines for adults. But the United Kingdom hasn't recommended them for anyone older than 14 since the 1950s, except for pregnant women or for those with tetanus-prone wounds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These findings indicate that after completing the childhood vaccination series, decennial booster vaccinations may no longer be needed to maintain protective immunity in the general population.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yet the investigators found that the United Kingdom had a slightly lower rate of tetanus and diphtheria infection and that population immunity remained strong even through a 2022 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468266723001755?pes=doc&amp;amp;utm_source=asm&amp;amp;getft_integrator=asm"&gt;&lt;span&gt;outbreak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of 73 imported diphtheria cases among immigrants seeking asylum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Remarkably, despite this proportionally large influx of imported diphtheria cases, there was no evidence of transmission reported among other asylum seekers who arrived by other routes or among staff or health care workers," the authors wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The authors caution that adult boosters should still be considered for emergency use in cases involving susceptible wounds, pregnant women, travelers to areas endemic for diphtheria, and anyone who didn't complete the childhood vaccine series.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"These findings indicate that after completing the childhood vaccination series, decennial booster vaccinations may no longer be needed to maintain protective immunity in the general population," the researchers wrote, adding that the move would more closely align US recommendations with the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which haven't recommended adult boosters against tetanus or diphtheria since 2017.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This scent is strong enough for a canine nose to detect with remarkable accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery could open the door to faster, cheaper, and entirely non‑invasive screening for a condition that currently lacks an early diagnostic test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study brought together &lt;a href="https://www.medicaldetectiondogs.org.uk/"&gt;Medical Detection Dogs&lt;/a&gt; in Milton Keynes with scientists from the Universities of &lt;a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/%C3%B9"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/"&gt;Manchester&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over several months, the charity’s trainers conditioned two retriever-type dogs to recognize the odor that clings to sebum. This oily substance, which our skin naturally produces, changes when &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/parkinsons-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; (PD) is present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-training-dogs-to-detect-disease"&gt;Training dogs to detect disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During training, the canines encountered more than 200 gauze swabs. Some were taken from recently &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-that-dogs-can-alert-humans-to-valley-fever-disease/"&gt;diagnosed patients&lt;/a&gt;, others from volunteers with no neurological illness, and a few from people living with different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each pad was clipped to a stand. When a dog paused and pointed at a positive sample, the handler quietly clicked and offered a reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the final double-blind trial – where neither the dog handler nor the overseeing scientist knew which positions held a patient’s swab – the dogs showed sensitivity of up to 80 percent and specificity of up to 98 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, they were also able to detect Parkinson’s in swabs from people with multiple health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-scent-of-parkinson-s"&gt;The scent of Parkinson’s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dog noses are legendary, but &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-immunotherapy-drug-also-works-to-slow-progression-of-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt; researchers turned to them for a very specific reason. Excess sebum and a change in body odor often precede the familiar motor symptoms – shaking, slowed movement, and rigid muscles – by years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Scottish nurse named Joy Milne famously noticed a musky shift in her husband’s scent long before his diagnosis. Her observation inspired scientists to hunt for molecular fingerprints in skin oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A laboratory method based on mass‑spectrometry is inching forward, yet requires expensive instruments and trained personnel. Canines offer a shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are extremely proud to say that once again, dogs can very accurately detect disease,” said Claire Guest, CEO and Chief Scientific Officer at Medical Detection Dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is currently no early test for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-immunotherapy-drug-also-works-to-slow-progression-of-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and symptoms may start up to 20 years before they become visible and persistent leading to a confirmed diagnosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Timely diagnosis is key as subsequent treatment could slow down the progression of the disease, and reduce the intensity of symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-detection-rates-that-rival-medical-tests"&gt;Detection rates that rival medical tests&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even seasoned neurologists can misclassify early Parkinson’s, and imaging scans or spinal fluid assays are costly. By contrast, the gold-coated sensitivity and specificity reported here exceed those of many existing point-of-care tests in medical use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Identifying diagnostic biomarkers of PD – particularly those that may predict development or help diagnose disease earlier – is the subject of much ongoing research,” said lead author Nicola Rooney, an animal behavior specialist at the University of Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rooney noted that the dogs in the study achieved high sensitivity and specificity and showed there is an olfactory signature distinct to patients with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sensitivity levels of 70 percent and 80 percent are well above chance, and I believe that dogs could help us develop a quick, noninvasive, and cost-effective method to identify patients with Parkinson’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blinded-trials-confirm-the-results"&gt;Blinded trials confirm the results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To guard against subconscious cues or handler bias, the researchers also presented every testing line in reverse order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A computer kept track of which sample sat where, and only after the dog’s choice did researchers learn whether to dispense a treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rigorous protocol mirrors clinical trial standards and boosts confidence that the animals relied on smell alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogs-help-build-smell-sensors"&gt;Dogs help build smell sensors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs will never replace neurologists, but the findings give chemists a shortlist of volatile molecules to capture with sensors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study adds to the growing body of evidence showing that simple, noninvasive skin swabs can be used to diagnose Parkinson’s disease,” said Perdita Barran, a professor of analytical chemistry at the University of Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Barran’s lab is already dissecting the swab chemistry; the canine results confirm those molecules belong on the diagnostic radar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogs-and-other-neurological-diseases"&gt;Dogs and other neurological diseases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers and dog trainers are beginning to explore how these animals can detect other neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis, and even conditions like migraines or autism-related sensory episodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Alzheimer’s, for example, people in early stages of the disease may emit subtle changes in body odor – things a human nose would never catch, but a dog’s nose picks up with ease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These scent cues could one day help in screening or early detection, well before symptoms become obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also stories of dogs acting differently before their owners have a migraine or during MS flare-ups – becoming restless or unusually attentive – as if they sense something’s coming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some families of children with autism even report that service dogs notice sensory overload before it escalates, helping calm things down before a meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-expanding-the-science-of-scent"&gt;Expanding the science of scent&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future trials aim to include people with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-disruptions-could-signal-the-onset-of-alzheimers/"&gt;REM sleep behavior disorder&lt;/a&gt; – a risk state for Parkinson’s – to see whether dogs can spot the disease before a neurologist could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parallel chemical analyses will hunt for the exact compounds responsible for the odor. If those molecules prove consistent worldwide, engineers could embed them in low‑cost sensor chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now the message is hopeful: a straightforward skin swab carries hidden information about &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/coffee-grounds-could-help-prevent-neurodegenerative-diseases/"&gt;neurodegeneration&lt;/a&gt;, and a dog’s nose can read it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That knowledge could accelerate the quest for a rapid, painless test. It would offer one more tool to bring Parkinson’s onto clinicians’ radar while there is still time to slow its march.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1877718X251342485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Parkinson’s Disease&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 18:46:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNWlhtQ1c3UmMycFlFQVFEN3c0b2E3aFc4UzktS1dDc1RycEpzVk4zdlQzUkRMNHZzcXpISzRNelVHWlBocDFZZ0MyZHozcEFqN2dTU3dQRDU2SlZ2NW04WWs3TWFvVWZIa2NZZkw1YU5TNkJvNFZDLTFqRXZUTGt2ZmV1UTRFNUJuY2JZY1MyQmFjTWV3OUdWbE1qeWVyZEdjUVZMU1BldFozOHdnd1hV</guid></item><item><title>美国麻疹疫情能否阻止？ - WIRED | Can US Measles Outbreaks Be Stopped? - WIRED</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE03akhoOE55VFlQb001ektpMURnSXR6R3FvWnhVTG1EdVh1ZmM5QmVDQXNnZk5mcUNMRnpBUnVlTEVwY3NCbnl5QzU3QVRlSnZxX3dxY19mdGJmcHFzdmd4ZXg1N1c3ZzhWaTRHZVM3T2NNQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;The US is&lt;/span&gt; experiencing its worst &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/measles-cases-are-rising-other-diseases-could-follow/"&gt;year for measles&lt;/a&gt; in over three decades, with more than 1,300 cases in 40 states as of July 16. Cases were almost as high in 2019, putting the country’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt; at risk. Six years ago, health officials were able to stop the spread. But amid growing public backlash against vaccines, many of the tactics used then may not work now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Measles elimination means there has been no continuous transmission in a country for longer than 12 months. That almost happened in the 2019 outbreak, which largely affected Orthodox Jewish populations in New York City and some surrounding counties. In fall 2018, US travelers returning from Israel tested positive for measles. The disease quickly spread throughout close-knit communities, especially among children, due to low vaccination rates. While the statewide measles vaccination rate for school-age children was 98 percent the previous school year, vaccination coverage in schools in the outbreak area &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6819a4.htm"&gt;was only 77 percent&lt;/a&gt;. Because measles is highly contagious, a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9197781/"&gt;95 percent vaccination rate&lt;/a&gt; is needed to protect a community from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;As a result, the majority of measles cases occurred in individuals 18 and under, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514"&gt;nearly 86 percent&lt;/a&gt; of whom were known to be unvaccinated. Some of those people developed severe complications, including pneumonia, and nearly 8 percent were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The current surge is being fueled by an outbreak that started in an undervaccinated Mennonite community in West Texas. Cases have since spread to other Texas counties, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. Two children in Texas with no underlying conditions and one adult in New Mexico have died this year as a result of measles. All were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“There are definitely parallels. What we saw in New York was very much the result of years and years of spread of misinformation and disinformation around the safety of vaccines,” says Neil Vora, executive director of Preventing Pandemics at the Source Coalition and previously a medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who helped respond to the 2019 outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Cases eventually burned out in New York after a months-long effort that included both traditional public health approaches and policy changes at the local and state level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“You need to take the first case seriously, because it's like kindling. You never know when that fire is just going to break out,” says Oxiris Barbot, the current president and CEO of the United Hospital Fund, who served as New York City’s health commissioner from 2018 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;As the disease spread, Barbot realized the city health department would need to go to the source of transmission, largely the Orthodox Jewish schools in affected neighborhoods. Working with school administrators, they reviewed vaccination records to identify unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children. Following an exposure, those children were prohibited from attending school and childcare for 21 days, the incubation period for measles.

Symptoms initially include a high fever, cough, runny nose, or red eyes and — after about four days — a rash will often appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state health department urges Utahns with symptoms to stay away from others and call their clinic or doctor before going out to prevent exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL News</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 18:26:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNZU5RUXlxUmZXUHZRMXl1N0pTWUdsdjg2bzFqelpyT3BZejI3V2hqemVHMlJ1UkQzTDF2cGRZb2RIbEZQMldHaDg0S05ORXl2eVlrQ0JMdHB4NUJuc0VYbFpTQzNVa2Y0dWRaLV9CQnJVQUxKM0s4YWQ3ZlNKcUM1QXI1ZlMxaWlPYnc1R0ZKZFg3aFNDaU9fNzFhV25NZ2lfQUl4ZnZvdTgyVWhINUE4dDlLSQ</guid></item><item><title>婚姻建议：我妻子想多做爱。但我发现了一种更简单的方法来解决问题。- Slate Magazine | Marriage advice: My wife wants to have more sex.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64h6fg000o3b77kjcvhjta@published"&gt;I’m in a loving relationship with a woman I absolutely adore. We have sex two to three times a week, and it’s wonderful. But I’ve been using AI tools for masturbation nearly every day. It’s just so easy to explore wacky and fun scenarios (specifically in the fantasy and sci-fi genres) that I’ve found it dividing my attention from my girlfriend. I feel selfish and immature for not giving her all of my desire, and she’s told me she would like to have more sex. I really don’t know how to feel about this. Your perspective would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

Plus, you’re probably hearing about AI &lt;a href="https://slate.com/life/2025/06/ai-chatgpt-generator-grok-gemini-writing.html"&gt;ethical concerns &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://slate.com/life/2025/07/ai-college-cheating-gemini-chatgpt-students-policy.html"&gt;everywhere these days&lt;/a&gt; (and if you’ve somehow missed the discourse, you &lt;a href="https://slate.com/tag/artificial-intelligence"&gt;can get up to speed on Slate&lt;/a&gt;). I think AI’s only going to become more integrated in our culture, whether we like it or not. So I’m accepting it as a given and treating it here like garden-variety porn, as you’re using it as a masturbation aid and the content is basically immaterial, or at least not nearly as important as its role as said aid.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64h6lg000s3b77b9g7b881@published"&gt;You are allowed to have a sexual life of your own. Masturbation is healthy and a great way of keeping in touch (literally!) with your own body and sexuality. It becomes problematic when it causes distress and/or is subtractive from your lifestyle. If you had written to say that all of your sexual energy is taken up by your masturbation and porn viewing, and that you and your partner don’t like this, it would be a different issue. However, you are enjoying it and managing to have sex two or three times a week, which is above average. If you were preoccupied by said porn/unable to focus on your partner, again, it would be a different issue, but it seems as though you have struck a balance.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="181" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64h6qr000t3b773eda0byr@published"&gt;If you think that less masturbation would yield more sex, and you actually want that, then by all means, cut back. You don’t have to abstain. Instead of nearly every day, you could masturbate every other day and see if that increases your energy and desire for partnered sex. Maybe on the days that you are feeling less sexual with your partner, you show up for her anyway and make out with her while she masturbates, give her oral, finger her, use toys on her, or something of the like. Make the session about her, not you. Perhaps there’s some aspect about the fantasies and scenarios you feel comfortable exploring through AI that you can share with your wife, either by viewing/reading porn together or role-playing. But it sounds like you’re having a healthy amount of sex. It could be that you’re at your natural limit for partnered sex, and masturbation is simply not affecting it. Again, experiment. Go a week without masturbating and see if your sex drive for your partner increases. You may surprise yourself, or you might not.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a very small amount of blood, but it means that the majority of my loads have a light pink or red tinge to them. I’m grateful that this is all I’m dealing with, as I’ve come to learn that prostatitis can present some serious, incredibly painful symptoms for people. From a medical point of view, I’m handling it. I’ve got a good urologist, am attending pelvic floor therapy, and am massaging my prostate regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="132" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64vu32002y3b77pzz8wpgz@published"&gt;But from a sexual point of view, I’m having a hard time. Cumming is not painful, I’m still horny, and my doc has assured me I should still ejaculate on a semi-regular schedule while I’m working to get this managed. But as a single guy who prefers low-key hookups, I’m struggling to figure out a way to finish with someone without having to explain the whole deal. And while I’ve become accustomed to it, I get that the sight of a red-tinged load of cum is not normal for someone (the first time I saw it myself, I actually fainted!) and isn’t a welcome surprise during climax. Unfortunately, I’m not into orgasm denial/chastity play, and getting off is an important part of a hookup for me if I’m going to have one.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="117" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64vu33002z3b774gidhlod@published"&gt;From this, I’m left trying to figure out a way I could possibly hook up with someone (and finish) without them actually seeing my load. Should I make a big deal about being very turned on by cumming on a guy’s backside? Are there ways, both creative and ethical, that I could employ to enjoy some fun with a casual hookup that doesn’t require me to give them a spiel about why they’re seeing what they’re seeing? I’m vers, so I am open to pretty much any suggestion. I’m also on PrEP, vaccinated, and tested regularly—it’s just something about the presence of blood that makes me feel like nondisclosure here is more unethical, somehow. Any guidance is appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="148" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64vu3500323b77lwddrnkc@published"&gt;Your concerns make sense and underscore a paradox of modern gay hook-up culture: We put ourselves in vulnerable positions again and again with strangers who don’t know (or sometimes don’t &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt;) much about us, so they may feel free to dispense their judgment openly, which makes us that much more vulnerable. Your rosé loads could be received by partners with not so much as a shrug, just as easily as they could be regarded with suspicion or even mockery. For you, each shot load is a crapshoot. You could take this as an opportunity: Partners’ reactions will show you whether they’re worth keeping around. You’ll see what they’re made of by what they make of you, to &lt;a href="https://genius.com/Ani-difranco-willing-to-fight-lyrics"&gt;paraphrase Ani DiFranco&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, that would mean enduring the bad feedback as well as the good, and it seems like you want to avoid the bad entirely, which is understandable.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd69vj6e005x3b77qd4om6jh@published"&gt;Given that hematospermia is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3921834/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;generally regarded as benign&lt;/a&gt; I don’t think you have too much to worry about in terms of the ethics of disclosure here. Sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/blood-in-the-semen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;it’s caused by an STI&lt;/a&gt; but you know for a fact that’s not the case here. If it is discovered by your partner, you would definitely want to explain that it’s not the product of an STI, but it makes sense that you want to fly under the radar with your pinkish sperm.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64vu3600333b77zcgu2xuu@published"&gt;You could come inside of them, whether or not you use condoms. Burying your load is the best way to prevent your partner from seeing its color. Guys who want to be bred typically &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to be bred, so you are unlikely to arouse suspicion. A condom would be even easier to manage, as you can handle the disposal yourself—tie it up, throw it in the trash, and no one is the wiser. And yes, you can pull out and shoot on their backs as well—offer to towel them down yourself after, and, again, handle the disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

This is working out pretty well, all things considered, but we’re not ready for group play at the moment. My wife thinks that means that we can’t reach out to other couples who are looking to swap because her opinion is that a swap means group play with everyone in the same room. I think it’s more likely that you just swap partners in separate spaces. I know there’s no right or wrong answer here, but what’s the more common interpretation?&lt;/p&gt;

If you think about the way the greater culture of swinging and polyamory operates, swapping often takes place at parties/clubs, where the action is out in the open. Yes, some parties have private booths or sections where interested people can go for some one-on-one time, but the general vibe is all out in the open. That, of course, allows for people to scope out the action and potentially join. “Open” often has a multipurpose use when describing relationships—it is often taken as meaning not only that you are open to other partners, but open to a lot of different things that you can do with them.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="180" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd64w276003l3b77gf8j4roj@published"&gt;But why leave anything up to assumptions? People have boundaries, and they are best stated upfront. Even if people would normally enter a situation with another couple with the expectation that you all play together (or at least in the same room), you can counter said assumptions by stating your limits and preferences. People will then use that information to determine whether or not they’re willing to hook up with you. There may be couples that you encounter who have a rule that they only play together (in the same room). There may be others who are a bit freer (which is to say: open) and will accept your stated parameters because they’re really into you and want you however they can get you. You can explain to them your reasons for wanting the configurations that you do (you’re new to this, moving slowly, and full-on group play is off the table for the time being) or not. Just be clear and let people respond in kind. You’ll be fine. Certainly, what you are asking for is not unheard of.&lt;/p&gt;

They have discovered this about themselves (or perhaps just been more open about it) the last year or so. I’m glad they are finding their truth, and I have tried to be supportive of them, helping them learn to do makeup, buying them nice heels and helping them pick out clothing, defending them to a few members of our families and other bigots. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/01/bisexual-lover-lost-interest-sex-advice.html"&gt;What’s really frustrating me, is lately, or the last year or so, they’ve made comments about lack of sex to our mutual friends and even around our families.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frailty is a medically defined condition in older adults that increases vulnerability to everyday stresses, leading to a higher risk of falls, hospitalization and loss of independence. Warning signs of frailty include:&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;
     
     
     &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7587637799"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unintentional weight loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moving slowly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feeling weak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent tiredness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low levels of physical activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because most of these signs have a direct link to how active someone is, walking is a particularly effective way to help &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt; improve their overall health and quality of life and maintain independence for longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a common question remains: How fast should older adults walk to see real benefits? Traditionally, the "talk test" has been used to guide walking intensity: people are encouraged to walk at a pace that makes it difficult to sing but still allows for comfortable conversation. However, this method is subjective and difficult to apply consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study led by researchers at the University of Chicago Medicine found that walking slightly faster—14 steps per minute more than a person's usual pace—led to meaningful improvements in physical function among older adults who were frail or at risk of becoming frail. "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0323759" target="_blank"&gt;Walking cadence as a measure of activity intensity and impact on functional capacity for prefrail and frail older adults&lt;/a&gt;," was published in &lt;i&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second study, the researchers developed and tested a smartphone app designed to accurately measure walking pace, making it easier to integrate this beneficial practice into &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/daily+life/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;daily life&lt;/a&gt;. "&lt;a href="https://karger.com/dib/article/doi/10.1159/000545982/928754/A-smartphone-application-to-measure-walking" target="_blank"&gt;A smartphone application to measure walking cadence before major abdominal surgery in older adults&lt;/a&gt;" was published in &lt;i&gt;Digital Biomarkers&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Why study walking pace?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking cadence—the number of steps taken per minute—is an intuitive and pragmatic way to measure walking intensity. Daniel Rubin, MD, an anesthesiologist at UChicago Medicine, became interested in cadence because of his &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+experience/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical experience&lt;/a&gt; evaluating &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older patients&lt;/a&gt; preparing for surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Older adults have a high risk of complications associated with surgery," he said. "Traditionally, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/surgical+teams/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;surgical teams&lt;/a&gt; have relied on physical function questionnaires to risk stratify patients, but I thought there must be a way to develop more objective metrics."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Walking faster is healthier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial, Rubin and his colleagues studied older adults classified as frail or prefrail. Participants were enrolled in structured walking programs within their retirement communities, guided and assessed by clinical research staff, and cadence was measured by a device fitted to their thigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group was encouraged to walk "as fast as safely possible," while another group walked at their usual comfortable pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study's results showed clear benefits: those who increased their cadence by at least 14 steps per minute above their usual pace (to roughly 100 steps per minute) experienced substantial improvements in their functional capacity, demonstrated by their ability to walk longer distances in a standardized test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People who haven't experienced frailty can't imagine how big a difference it makes to be able to not get tired going to the grocery store or not need to sit down while they're out," Rubin said.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;An intuitive walking app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on these findings, Rubin's team created a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/smartphone+app/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;smartphone app&lt;/a&gt; called "Walk Test," which they designed specifically for measuring walking cadence accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We didn't necessarily trust smartphones' built-in analytics," Rubin said. "Instead, we built an app that uses a novel open-source method to analyze the data measured by the phone and lets us actively engage users in brief, deliberate walking tests, ensuring accurate measurement."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Validation testing showed that the app counts steps per minute with exceptional accuracy, closely matching specialized, research-grade accelerometers. Rubin noted that Walk Test was designed for accessibility and user-friendliness in addition to accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to make it as low-barrier as possible so it's easy for older adults to use without additional equipment," he said. "The people who need the most help are usually the least well-equipped to get started."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practical advice for daily life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research highlights walking as a widely accessible exercise with substantial health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Even casual walking had positive effects on our study participants," Rubin said. But for those who are able, increasing their walking pace judiciously can yield even greater results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use cadence to guide your walking intensity, start by measuring your usual walking pace in steps per minute to establish a baseline. From there, try increasing your pace slightly to find a level that still feels comfortable but brisker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To maintain a steady and elevated cadence, Rubin recommends using a metronome app to match your steps to a consistent beat. While the Walk Test app developed by the research team is not yet available to the public, metronome apps are a simple alternative that can help walkers stay on pace and track progress over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These methods can help integrate faster-paced walking into daily routines, offering a simple yet effective strategy to people who want to stay healthier and more independent as they age.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adverse experiences and environments in childhood&lt;/strong&gt; may cause a chain reaction of mental and physical health problems later in life, according to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40289919/"&gt;new University of Georgia research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_102393" class="wp-caption alignleft"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sierra-Carter.webp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-102393" class="wp-image-102393 size-medium" src="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sierra-Carter-300x292.webp" alt="Environmental portrait of researcher Sierra Carter in an office in front of bookshelves" srcset="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sierra-Carter-300x292.webp 300w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sierra-Carter-768x747.webp 768w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sierra-Carter-549x534.webp 549w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sierra-Carter-810x788.webp 810w, https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sierra-Carter.webp 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-102393" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Sierra Carter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study suggests growing up with negative events and in dangerous communities in early adolescence can alter an entire lifetime, particularly for Black men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things that happen to you in childhood — from how you’re raised as a child to the environment that you’re in — can lead to long-standing issues,” said &lt;a href="https://cfr.uga.edu/a-new-associate-director-for-cfr/"&gt;Sierra Carter&lt;/a&gt;, co-author of the study and the new associate director of UGA’s &lt;a href="https://cfr.uga.edu/"&gt;Center for Family Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unfavorable environments, treatment in childhoods influence substance use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers relied on data from the UGA-led &lt;a href="https://cfr.uga.edu/for-researchers/projects/fachs/"&gt;Family and Community Health Study&lt;/a&gt;. Beginning in 1996, the ongoing study follows more than 800 families, all of which had a fifth grader at the start of the study. The researchers reinterview participants every two to three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study found starting at age 10, children were already able to register when their environments and treatment around them were unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsafe community environments affected not only the way the children acted but also created a physical, inflammatory response in their central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in young adulthood, these stressors on both body and mind translated to earlier and more frequent use of substances as a way of self-medicating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We found a lag with these background childhood experiences and drinking,” said &lt;a href="https://psychology.uga.edu/directory/people/steven-beach"&gt;Steven Beach&lt;/a&gt;, corresponding author of the study and director of the Center for Family Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once kids moved out of the protective environment of their homes, the delayed inflammatory responses had a chance to emerge and influence their behavior in a bigger way, setting the stage for elevated alcohol consumption.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alcohol misuse causes lasting physical consequences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumption of excessive amounts of alcohol over time created measurable health complications in adulthood for participants in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who reported drinking heavily as young adults were at higher risk of heart problems as they got older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, those 29-year-olds had worse aging outcomes as a result of this drinking, meaning there was a possibly shorter life expectancy, and faster signs of aging across numerous body systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effect of alcohol on aging was especially pronounced for women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dangerous childhoods have disproportionate effect on Black men, women&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repercussions of adverse childhoods were compounded for Black men and women, largely due to the added effects of discrimination in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Being exposed to racial discrimination puts you at risk for early alcohol use, which then puts you at risk for later alcohol use and other diseases down the road,” Carter said. “That’s a well-established pathway that gets people on this difficult trajectory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black participants who experienced racism in early life were more likely to binge drink and experience cardiac issues and faster aging in their appearance and body functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I firmly believe that we can do better than we currently are in terms of protecting children in a whole variety of ways,” Beach said. “It’s just really important for us to think about the delayed effects of childhood experiences that carry forward and have an impact on life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This study also underscores the likely payoff of investments in children and building strong, safe communities. If we can intervene early, if we can support kids, the payoffs are likely to not just be immediate. They’re likely to be very long lasting, all the way out through adulthood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was published in Development and Psychopathology and was funded by the National Cancer Institute, National Institute on Drug Abuse awarded and National Institute on Aging.

              &lt;h1&gt;Scientists Develop High-Performance MRI Scanner in Effort to Define Microscopic Brain Structures&lt;/h1&gt;
                  &lt;p class="nih-subtitle"&gt;Next-generation system noninvasively images tiny nerve structures disrupted in brain disorders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;a href="/sites/default/files/2025-07/ninds-20250716.jpg" class="link--no-tag link--zoom-in"&gt;&lt;article class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-float-right"&gt;

            &lt;p class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Chiara Maffei, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;
      
  &lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;p&gt;A scientific team supported in part by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed a new, ultra-high-resolution brain imaging system that can reconstruct microscopic brain structures that are disrupted in neurological and neuropsychiatric brain disorders. The new system is a significant advance over conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners that cannot visualize these tiny but clinically important structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system, called the Connectome 2.0 human MRI scanner, overcomes a significant hurdle for neuroscientists: being able to bridge different brain regions and probe tiny structures necessary to define the “connectome,” the complex matrix of structural connections between nodes in the nervous system, and to do it noninvasively in living humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This research is a transformative leap in brain imaging – pushing the boundaries of what we can see and understand about the living human brain at a cellular level,” said John Ngai, Ph.D., Director of NIH’s &lt;em&gt;Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies® &lt;/em&gt;Initiative, or The BRAIN Initiative&lt;em&gt;®&lt;/em&gt;. “The new scanner lays essential groundwork for the &lt;a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/research/neuroimaging-technologies-across-scales/brain-initiative-connectivity-across-scales"&gt;BRAIN CONNECTS&lt;/a&gt; program’s ultimate goal of developing a wiring diagram for the human brain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scanner is innovative in two major ways: it fits snugly around the heads of living people, and it has many more channels than typical MRI systems. These advances greatly increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the system, providing much sharper images of very small biological brain structures than previously possible. These technical upgrades will enable scientists to map human brain fibers and cellular architecture down to nearly single-micron precision to study how subtle changes in cells and connections relate to cognition, behavior, and disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the team showed that the scanner was safe in healthy research volunteers, revealing subtle microstructural differences (individual axon diameter or cell size) between individual brains. Before this new system, this was only feasible in postmortem or animal studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our goal was to build an imaging platform that could truly span scales – from cells to circuits,” said senior author Susie Huang, M.D., Ph.D., of the Department of Radiology at Mass General Hospital. “It provides researchers and clinicians with a powerful new tool to study brain architecture in health and disease, in real time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work is an important step toward developing a complete wiring diagram of the brain, an achievement that requires novel approaches to map the brain at different scales: across large brain regions and circuits, as well as at the level of tiny cells and connections. It also opens the door for future advances in precision neuroscience, in which noninvasive brain stimulation may help treat brain disorders tailored to an individual’s unique brain circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded in part by The BRAIN Initiative&lt;em&gt;®&lt;/em&gt;. It supports the BRAIN Initiative Connectivity Across Scales (BRAIN CONNECTS) program, which aims to develop the research capacity and technical capabilities to generate wiring diagrams that can span entire brains across multiple scales. The findings were reported July 16 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Doctors gave her just a 32 percent chance of surviving the next five years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I was in complete shock. I remember staring at the floor not knowing what to think, not knowing what was next, that was a big worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've had to grow up faster in a week than I have in 25 years.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caldwell is just one of the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14695689/colon-cancers-doctors-alarmed-rise-sharply-young-people.html"&gt;ever-increasing number of women&lt;/a&gt; diagnosed with breast cancer before they turn 50, which is now among the fastest growing cancers in the age group alongside colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Savannah Caldwell has been diagnosed with stage four breast cancer at age 25 years after previously been told she was 'too young' to have cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers say breast cancer cases among young women are now &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/fb-6039909/WHAT-BREAST-CANCER-PEOPLE-DOES-STRIKE-SYMPTOMS.html"&gt;rising by up to 1.85 percent per year, with an extra 4,000 women being diagnosed with the cancer annually in the US compared to a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While breast cancer in women in their 20s is rare, it's not unheard of. About 6.5 out of every 100,000 women in their 20s will receive a breast cancer diagnosis, according to the American Cancer Society&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They remain puzzled by the surge, especially in healthy, young individuals, though some have pointed to possible environmental triggers or earlier onset of puberty as potential factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Caldwell, who is from Russell,the diagnosis came with devastating physical symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shortly after learning she had stage four breast cancer, the 25-year-old developed crippling back pain caused by a tumor pressing against her spine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pain became so severe it made walking and even basic movement difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors immediately began an aggressive treatment plan, starting with 12 rounds of chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caldwell has already completed nine and may also undergo immunotherapy and radiation depending on how her body responds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Caldwell is pictured above amid chemotherapy, she has been recommended for 12 rounds of the treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing her story to local news station &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.wsaz.com/2025/07/15/savannahs-story-local-woman-battles-breast-cancer-25/"&gt;WSAZ&lt;/a&gt; , she said: 'At night, especially when with my kids, whenever we cuddle up... I look over... and I just hope I get to see them grow up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Things change minute-by-minute, but for the most part I am being very optimistic. I hope my will to fight can get me through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I want to fight, I want to live and I want my story to be a beautiful one no matter how long or short it is.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caldwell said the chemotherapy has gone well so far, but that she has started to lose her hair and has been losing weight rapidly, now being down to 88lbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an update after her fourth round of chemotherapy in June, she said: 'Between the third and fourth chemo a lot has changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Caldwell said her cancer is stage four and has spread to her ribs, spine and lungs. Doctors say she may also need radiation and immunotherapy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My hair is thinning a lot, just yesterday I noticed it is coming out in clumps. I am still experiencing a lot of back pain, neck pain, [pain] in my ribs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Through the night, I wake up very nauseous and almost projectile vomiting and it is harder to eat.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'I look forward to getting this over with, and getting through.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the ninth chemotherapy, she said she was 'still not sleeping much' but 'hanging in there'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have diagnosed her with invasive ductal carcinoma, the most common form of breast cancer and behind about 80 percent of all cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her friends have started a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/savannahs-cancer-battle"&gt;fundraiser online&lt;/a&gt; to raise money to help cover bills and complications linked to the chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the page, they write: 'Savannah is not going to be able to work for a long time.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any additional/new exposures to the public can be found on the &lt;a class="Link" href="https://krtv.org/CCCCHD"&gt;Cascade County website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spread of measles can occur before people know they have the disease and before any rash appears. The times listed on the website include the period when the exposure occurred and two hours after, which is how long the measles virus can remain airborne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Growing concerns over measles exposure in Great Falls:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEnhancement" data-video-disable-history&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who are immune to measles through vaccination, laboratory evidence of immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or were born before 1957 are not considered at risk for infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals without prior measles infection or vaccination have a 90% likelihood of contracting the disease if exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly infectious airborne disease that typically begins with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth, and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads downward to the rest of the body. It is particularly dangerous for infants for whom vaccination is generally not recommended until 12 months of age. Maintaining a high level of vaccination in the community helps protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated, as well as individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles continues to be prevalent in many regions worldwide, resulting in an estimated 300 deaths every day. This month, the federal Centers for Disease Control &amp;amp; Prevention (CDC) reported the highest number of measles cases in the United States since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000. As of July 8, 2025, there were 1,288 reported measles cases in 39 states. Montana has had a total of 26 cases of measles reported in four other counties in addition to Cascade County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to protect against measles is vaccination. No changes have been made to the existing measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine recommendations in the United States. Two doses of MMR, a measles-containing vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, are 97 to 99 percent effective in preventing measles. Measles vaccines have been available in the U.S. since 1963, and two doses have been recommended for children since 1989.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are not sure of your vaccination status, here are a few places you can review:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Call your old high school, college, or university and ask if they have vaccination records.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact your doctor’s office, urgent care, or pediatrician. Even if you have not been there in years, they may still have your records.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact the health department where you grew up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check your home state immunization registries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need the MMR vaccine, call your primary care physician as soon as possible. CCHD does have MMR vaccine available. Please call 406-454-6950 to make an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information about measles and the measles vaccine, visit the &lt;a class="Link" href="https://krtv.org/DPHHSmeasles"&gt;state health department’s website&lt;/a&gt;. Additional information can also be found on &lt;a class="Link" href="https://krtv.org/MeaslesCDC"&gt;the CDC’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you develop symptoms, you should continue to stay home except for testing or urgent/emergency treatment. Please call your healthcare provider or urgent care to arrange for testing. It is extremely important that you do not enter a clinic building without calling ahead to the clinic so that precautions can be taken to avoid exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCHD has a measles phone line at 406-791-9242. Please call this number for:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare provider reports of measles cases or suspected cases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immunization questions, record checks, or appointments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Testing information&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Questions about exposure or quarantine&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any other measles questions or concerns&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phone line is operated during business hours – if you call outside normal business hours and leave a message, we will contact you the following business day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Claudia Totir/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many factors can affect a person’s risk of developing dementia later in life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research has shown that diet is one factor that might influence dementia risk. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One study suggests that following certain diets, like the Mediterranean diet, could decrease dementia risk, while pro-inflammatory diets may increase risk. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can what people eat affect &lt;span&gt;their dementia risk? A new study suggests that this may likely be the case&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers explored in depth how certain dietary habits are related to dementia risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using data from the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;, the results confirm the benefits of dietary patterns like the Mediterranean diet and the MIND diet and suggest that inflammatory diets may increase someone’s chances of developing dementia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also indicate that the impact of diet on dementia risk may be more significant for women and older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examined diet and dementia risk while also considering the impact on people with certain characteristics, such as obesity or older age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers evaluated participants’ diets based on several scoring indices. One looked at adherence to the Mediterranean diet, and another at adherence to the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet. The &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/mind-diet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt; combines the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/254836" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;DASH&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324221" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; diets and focuses on components like nuts, leafy vegetables, and berries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next was the Recommended Food Score, which helps evaluate diet quality based on how much people eat certain foods like lean meat, low-fat dairy, fruits, and vegetables. There was also the Alternative Healthy Eating Index-2010, which looks at how well someone is following American Dietary Guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, researchers also used the Energy-adjusted Dietary Inflammatory Index (EDII) to look at how inflammatory diets were. This index considered components like some vitamins and minerals and components like alcohol and fat intake. Researchers then divided dietary index scores into four groups. They also considered covariates, including physical activity, smoking, and body mass index. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers were able to analyze data from 131,209 participants, who did not all have a baseline dementia diagnosis. They then had exact matching in each of the five dietary categories for sex and age. Exact matching is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10760465/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt; used in cohort studies that can help with confounding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At baseline, the average age of participants was age 56. The average follow-up time was 13.5 years, and throughout the follow-up, 1,453 participants developed dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall, participants with the lowest scores for the Mediterranean diet, the MIND diet, and the Recommended Food Score experienced the “highest incidence of dementia.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also observed that those with the lowest inflammatory diet scores and the highest Alternative Healthy Eating Index scores had “the lowest incidence of dementia after the follow-up period.” However, for these two groups, there were no quartile group differences that reached a significant level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers observed that higher scores for the Mediterranean diet, the MIND diet, the Recommended Food Score, and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index were all linked to decreased dementia risk. Following more of an inflammatory diet was linked to an increased dementia risk. They also found that higher scores for the MIND diet, the Recommended Food Score, and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index were all linked to a decreased risk for mild cognitive impairment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time was also an important factor. For example, at the less than five-year follow-up, only the MIND appeared to be associated with a decreased dementia risk. At the five to ten-year follow-up, more closely following the MIND diet, the Recommended Food Score, and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index appeared to decrease dementia risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the ten-year or more mark, some associations remained significant, such as how greater following of the Mediterranean diet appeared to lower dementia risk by 24%. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subgroup analyses looked at sex, age, and obesity. Researchers found that for participants ages 60 and older, more closely following the Mediterranean diet and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index reduced dementia risk, but this wasn’t the case for younger participants. The associations with other scoring indexes were still significant regardless of age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For women, closer adherence to all healthy diets and lower inflammatory diet scores all appeared to lower dementia risk. For men, only the Recommended Food Score appeared to significantly decrease dementia risk, and the effects were still better for women.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the Mediterranean diet appeared to help with dementia risk regardless of weight. A greater inflammatory diet score was associated with an increased risk for dementia in participants with obesity. The other healthy dietary patterns besides the Mediterranean diet helped lower dementia risk for participants who did not have obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, researchers looked at how these diets impacted people with the ApoEε4 genotype, which can &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Institute on Aging" rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/alzheimers-disease-genetics-fact-sheet" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;increase risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; for Alzheimer’s disease. For non-ApoEε4 carriers, higher scores of all healthy diets helped to decrease dementia risk, and higher inflammatory diet scores increased risk. For ApoEε4 carriers, only adherence to the Recommended Food Score appeared to help decrease dementia risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1891877213/amarish-dave-do" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Amarish Dave&lt;/a&gt;, DO, an osteopathic physician specializing in neurology, who was not involved in the study, commented with his thoughts on the findings: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study adds hard numbers to what we know intuitively, which is that healthy diets lower your dementia risk, and inflammatory foods raise it. It confirms that healthy eating patterns matter when it comes to reducing dementia risk. The size and quality of the data make these results hard to ignore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study adds information regarding potential dietary interventions related to dementia. There are limitations, such as the study was only in participants in the U.K., and some information comes from participant reporting. There may be restrictions on generalizability to other groups, and future research can have more diversity. Any general limitations of the UK Biobank also apply to this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers note that the self-reporting of food intake increases the risk of recall bias; people can make mistakes such as incorrectly estimating portions and nutrients. They also note the possibility of an underestimation of the association between diet and risk for dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were between ages 40 and 69 at baseline, and researchers only did follow-up for a certain timeframe. Researchers suggest that using other follow-up periods and working with diverse age groups could be helpful, as this could reveal variation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet information was collected in a narrow window, and researchers did not take into account how participants’ diets could have changed during the follow-up. The researchers suggest that examining dietary changes could be helpful in truly looking at the potential long-term impact of diet on people’s chances of developing dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some dietary data was lacking. For example, researchers note that they lacked information on how much olive oil participants were consuming, so they weren’t able to include this in the scoring when considering the Mediterranean diet. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6949890/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Olive oil&lt;/a&gt; is a major component of the Mediterranean diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also lacked data from the original Dietary Inflammatory Index, so they only included some elements of this index. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledge that the use of exact matching in this study was also limiting. They explain that “the estimated effect can only be generalized to a small population and lacks precision.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the risk for residual confounding, which researchers acknowledge could impact “dietary choices and dementia risk.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study highlights the diet’s important role in possibly protecting against dementia. &lt;a href="https://siliconpsych.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Alex Dimitriu&lt;/a&gt;, MD, double board certified in Psychiatry and Sleep Medicine and founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry &amp;amp; Sleep Medicine, who was also not involved in the study, noted the following clinical implications of the research: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study speaks to the importance of long-term adherence to diet and the benefits of this. It also demonstrates how diet may play a greater role for older women than for other groups. Also of interest, the study confirms prior findings that pro-inflammatory diets (high in saturated fats, and refined carbohydrates) can be a risk factor for dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also suggest the need for doctors to keep discussing diets with their clients. As noted by Dave: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Doctors should be talking to patients about brain-healthy diets just like we talk about heart health. Eating less processed food and more whole, anti-inflammatory foods could be a powerful tool to prevent cognitive decline.

But one day, maybe not far off, it could change the way many babies are made everywhere — posing new moral and political questions as reproduction could increasingly become an outcome not of sex but of genetic preselection and data-mining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BKYAQSE2Y5HU7KVX6JVIMVVDCI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“For something as consequential as your child, I don’t think people want to roll the dice,” the 30-year-old entrepreneur told The Washington Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GER27PVH3RE6LEELOQELAXJ5LM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It is now standard for pregnant women and couples undergoing in vitro fertilization to test for rare genetic disorders stemming from a single gene mutation, such as cystic fibrosis, or chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome. But Orchid is the first company to say it can sequence an embryo’s entire genome of 3 billion base pairs. It uses as few as five cells from an embryo to test&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;for more than 1,200 of these uncommon single-gene-derived, or monogenic, conditions. The company also applies custom-built algorithms to produce what are known as polygenic risk scores, which are designed to measure a future child’s genetic propensity for developing complex ailments later in life, such as bipolar disorder, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, obesity and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GYCJ7VHH9H2YNBUE968RW8JQ4R" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Orchid, Siddiqui &lt;a href="https://x.com/noor_siddiqui_/status/1859232081202893153"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;, is ushering in “a generation that gets to be genetically blessed and avoid disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RFCKRQJAQBBQ7O6JMDNKCMS77A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Right now, at $2,500 per embryo-screening on top of the average $20,000 for a single cycle of IVF, Siddiqui’s social network in Silicon Valley and other tech hubs is an ideal target market.

Soon, she suggests, it will be unremarkable for hopeful couples to choose their embryos by spreadsheet, as her current clients do, weighing, say, a propensity for heart disease that is 1.7 times the risk of the general population against a 2.7 score for schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LME7AKY6B5DANJI3SKP4JKWZL4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Zilis, the mother of four of Musk’s at least 14 children, has been an Orchid client, according to two people close to the company, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. They said at least one of Musk and Zilis’s offspring is an Orchid baby. Siddiqui declined to comment on that assertion, which was first reported by the Information, a tech industry news site, last summer.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Musk and Zilis did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="COTBZAATHBATLLK5DFGXAKM2ZQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Orchid represents a slice of a broader&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;cultural movement in which powerful people in Washington and Silicon Valley are&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;pushing the importance of producing offspring. Vice President JD Vance, Musk and Siddiqui’s early benefactor, the conservative&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;billionaire investor Peter Thiel,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;have all repeatedly argued that falling birth rates threaten&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the future of industrialized nations and that people should have more children to counteract the decline — a viewpoint known as pronatalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VCFB3AKAR5HY7PXAJBRIPK4OOQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This growing movement, which is far from a monolith&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;and has fierce debates within it, is giving a huge boost to a fertility industry already experiencing heightened demand. In February, the Trump White House issued an executive order pushing for expanded access to IVF. And&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;while the loudest voices arguing that people should have more babies are on the right, there’s broader political&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;support for increasing access to fertility treatments: A California law mandating that all large insurers cover IVF and other fertility services went into effect on July 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7WGOPNPUNRAJRAOPKVIG63EHJU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In Silicon Valley, innovations that could make these services more affordable and accessible are coming, some of them backed by people concerned with population decline. Thiel has funded the egg-freezing robotics start-up TMRW, launched a $200 million fund to bring fertility services to Asia and bankrolled a family planning app connected to a right-wing magazine. The investor, who is gay, has recently become a father to four children through IVF and surrogacy, according to people familiar with his family choices,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe personal relationships. Thiel declined, through a spokesperson, to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3J3H5D4UNJGY5GOORU6H2GNI6M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Siddiqui, who has already created 16 of her own embryos and plans to do more IVF rounds, says her company has an important role to play in advancing people’s ability to have more children.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;She told The Post that being able to have a healthy child should be considered a basic human right, and she has &lt;a href="https://guides.orchidhealth.com/post/conceivable-with-noor-fighting-the-fertility-crisis-with-robin-hanson"&gt;hosted&lt;/a&gt; a podcast episode&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;on “Fighting the Fertility Crisis,” a discussion about the causes of population decline. The extensive genetic screening Orchid provides, she said, can help more people have babies — both by improving the IVF success rate and allaying parents’ fears about future babies’ health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BYH7GAMZ3RB6PJBFZC5PF67EYI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I think everyone who wants to have a baby should be able to have one,” she said, adding that IVF and genetic testing should be made available and affordable for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UISXH2T5TBCMVCW63SBEFDTGTQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But Orchid doesn’t just help people have children; it helps them shape their future children in dramatically new ways. And that has sparked controversy. Some critics see its polygenic scoring as veering toward a contemporary form of eugenics, enabling a world in which the rich leap even further ahead with super intelligence and superior health starting from birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="R7YGDNPLPFEITLWDZSWMJZVWFM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Musk, who has funded a population research institute at the University of Texas, wants to produce offspring with genes for superior intelligence, Zilis told one of Musk’s biographers. The two people close to the company said Siddiqui has provided intelligence screenings in the past to couples on an ad hoc basis — including, one of them said, to Zilis and Musk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SSQY2J4GI5CW7EH6O63TN2WUPQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Orchid declined to comment on that and vociferously rejected any association with eugenics. Siddiqui said Orchid helps prospective parents who would otherwise fear having children because of potential genetic disorders. IVF was controversial when it began in the 1970s, she said; protesters showed up with “pitchforks” at the offices of the scientists pioneering the breakthrough and tried “to put them in jail” for playing God. If they had prevailed, she added, “12 million people wouldn’t exist today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DULTN4J6PJA55NLJNBZSPBHO2Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Orchid screens for intellectual disability but does not provide intelligence predictions, Siddiqui said. A growing number of start-ups do, however. One of them is the Thiel-funded start-up Nucleus; another is Heliospect Genomics,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the research arm of Herasight, an executive of which is a&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;bioethicist who advocates “liberal eugenics” — casting that term as applying not to governmental efforts to weed out undesirable births but instead to parents’ use of emerging biological tools to enhance their children’s prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X6X2CWJFKFAI5LSQFRWPQQSG2U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Until last month, Orchid’s website featured&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;advice from that bioethicist, Jonathan Anomaly, on overcoming skepticism about its service. “We intentionally alter our environments, breed crops so that they’re more nutritious and easier to harvest, and we’ve invented lightning rods and vaccines to make us less likely to die from natural disasters,” he wrote. “I find the playing God objection a bit tiresome.” Orchid removed the page after The Post asked about it. Anomaly said he now prefers the term “genetic enhancement” to “eugenics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HDREYTYJ4RAA7J3ZQYEWQEGBKM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Delian Asparouhov, a partner at Thiel’s Founders Fund who has invested in Nucleus, made a similar argument. “When you choose your married partner, you’re using a form of eugenics,” he said. “When your kids are older, you invest in tutors and great schools. What’s the harm in using a tool that allows you to amplify that type of effect?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="LUEFSOBARVHHVPJZKPZX6SCCJU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="LUEFSOBARVHHVPJZKPZX6SCCJU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;‘Russian roulette’ or a jet to the future?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5T6OBIJ4NFA55JWAVPK4SELMNA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the United States, there are virtually no restrictions on the types of genetic predictions companies can offer, and no external vetting of their proprietary scoring methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NHB4KE2IF5FEZGS62YVTZGWAFA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Orchid and a handful of other start-ups offering polygenic risk scores are barreling forward in this largely unregulated milieu.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The first Orchid baby was born in late 2023, and Orchid is now in 100 IVF clinics in the U.S. — more than twice as many as a year ago. (The company won’t say how many babies have been born using its service.) Nucleus launched its screenings, which test embryos for more than 900 heritable traits and conditions, last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JTFY2BJ5O5FUTAZIQIEC5RRLEI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Yet several genetic scientists told The Post they doubt Orchid’s core claim: that it can accurately sequence an entire human genome from just five cells collected from an early-stage embryo, enabling it to see many more single- and multiple-gene-derived disorders than other methods have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-image subtype-StaffPhoto size-large" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-from-the-source" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QDR2IVFFHBE7LEWFI2ZNMBK53U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Experts have struggled to extract accurate genetic information from small embryonic samples, said Svetlana Yatsenko, a Stanford University pathology professor who specializes in clinical and research genetics. Genetic tests that use saliva or blood samples typically collect hundreds of thousands of cells. For its vastly smaller samples, Orchid uses a process called amplification, which creates copies of the DNA retrieved from the embryo. That process, Yatsenko said, can introduce major inaccuracies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RUALSKIKBVAMFMU3QEJTSY7A3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“You’re making many, many mistakes in the amplification,” she said, rendering it problematic to declare any embryo free of a particular disease, or positive for one. “It’s basically Russian roulette.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-from-the-source" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BDGSGO2H5FFGDNDGQ6VFLAGX4E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;George Church, a genomic sequencing pioneer at Harvard University and an Orchid investor, harbors no such doubts. Questioning the advancement&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;that enables Orchid to sequence the full genome from such a small sample — enabling long-term health predictions and near-term defect detections in an embryo — is “like asking how much faster is a jet than walking,” Church said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OLG7SRM5ABGCVNWY7EHH6JIGA4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Relying on a small number of cells is not the technology’s only shortcoming, other experts said. Numerous fertility doctors and scientists also told The Post they have serious reservations about screening embryos through polygenic risk scoring,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the technique that allows Orchid and other companies to predict future disease by tying clusters of hundreds or even thousands of genes to disease outcomes and in some cases to other traits, such as intelligence and height. The vast majority of diseases that afflict humans are associated with many different genes rather than a single gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V58QFNV5P51BQBT9CEACE6FZ9R" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These algorithmic scoring methods&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;are increasingly accepted by scientific and medical experts because they have shown promise in predicting the occurrence in a general population of a growing number of common ailments, including coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease and breast cancer. Researchers and clinicians hope that such complex genetic predictions will come to significantly enhance the quality of medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GAPD6DYK355U901Y6AD6YW9Z8W" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the genetic code reflects only propensities: Much is still unknown about how constellations of genes and gene variants interact with an individual’s environment and with one another to contribute to the likelihood of any individual getting a disease in life. And for traits such as intelligence, polygenic scoring has &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/how-well-can-genetic-scores-predict-iq-heres-what-the-latest-research-reveals/"&gt;almost negligible predictive capacity&lt;/a&gt; — just a handful of IQ points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-from-the-source" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6DJCGJULSJDMPC3VWUJI6DGKRA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Critics say&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;such scoring could compel&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;couples who have struggled with fertility issues to discard perfectly good and hard-won embryos based on inaccurate&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;or incomplete information. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38805697/"&gt;2024 paper raised concerns&lt;/a&gt; that the scores could encourage couples to unnecessarily incur the cost and physical burden of additional rounds of IVF. Or parents might select against an unwanted trait, such as schizophrenia, without understanding how they may be screening out desired traits associated with the same genes, such as creativity. “Maybe we don’t want to screen those people out of our society,” said Lior Pachter, a computational biologist specializing in genomics at the California Institute of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-from-the-source" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A33VGUDTUNCZJFFMSHHY25J3VE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In response to questions from The Post, an Orchid spokeswoman, Tara Harandi-Zadeh, said the company explicitly counsels patients not to throw away embryos. Company executives also downplayed the value of Orchid’s polygenic scores, which one described in an interview as merely an “add-on” benefit of the full-genome sequencing the company provides. The primary benefit of its service, she said, is the ability to detect many more single-gene-derived diseases and nonhereditary mutations than a standard genetic test conducted in an IVF clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JYYUCHBLK5FGNMI5ZC5TCMJYDI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Hundreds of serious monogenic diseases — each with well-established genetic causes — can now be detected before implantation,” Harandi-Zadeh said in a statement. “These aren’t vague risks or statistical associations; they’re clear, causal mutations that lead to profound outcomes: seizures, organ failure, inability to walk or speak, early death. These are missed without comprehensive whole genome embryo screening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CRJW7EGKMNBLRG5PCAQ3EPUBAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Orchid’s marketing materials and Siddiqui’s own descriptions have repeatedly showcased polygenic disease screening, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J4YO2VWUV5G2BPAODAFM63E4VY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The parents and their physician get much more information” from polygenic scoring, Siddiqui &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-ZL3pYNxno"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a 2023 video. “They get information about neurodevelopmental disorders, birth defects, pediatric hereditary cancers, complex conditions, meaning conditions where it’s not just a single gene, but dozens, hundreds, to millions of genes that contribute risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OL3UFQ26B5F3LOAKOFA33DS3NU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics&lt;a href="https://www.gimjournal.org/article/S1098-3600(23)01068-7/pdf"&gt; calls&lt;/a&gt; the benefits of screening embryos for polygenic risks “unproven” and warns that such tests “should not be offered” by clinicians. A pioneer of polygenic risk scores, Harvard epidemiology professor Peter Kraft, has criticized Orchid, &lt;a href="https://x.com/genes_pk/status/1380553618777063427?s=46"&gt;saying on X&lt;/a&gt; that “the science doesn’t add up” and that “waving a magic wand and changing some of these variants at birth may not do anything at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CCUXCTZJW5CBTKF4FCEU7AAGMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Still, many of those same experts say the scientific evidence supporting the validity of polygenic scoring methods is only getting better and already making its way into clinical use for adults. Consumer attitudes are liable to change, too. Asparouhov, the investor, said he was still critical of embryo selection based on polygenic scores. “Right now it’s a false choice,” he said. “But in the future, it’s the trust fund.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="5KVFM4MNYT5RQ632F0ZPMF90JC" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="5KVFM4MNYT5RQ632F0ZPMF90JC" data-testid="article-header"&gt;‘A license to do things’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DK84113F796B5FFPMNQCZGPT44" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The availability and power of consumer genetic tests have exploded in the past six to 10 years, powered by far cheaper human genome sequencing and large public and private biobanks that store genetic data from hundreds of thousands of volunteers. Researchers have used that data to explore connections between genes and population-wide disease outcomes, in what are known as genome-wide association studies, or GWAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2SXSMAOQ2FB73GBD5S4KDNPGPE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;An&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0183-z"&gt; influential 2018 paper&lt;/a&gt; in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Genetics&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;showed that groups of genes could be analyzed to identify people at significantly increased risk for five common ailments, including coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes and breast cancer. That paper and others opened up the possibility for clinicians to give people specific medical advice and treatments based on their genetic propensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F7LXB57M7JDBVKMUMLKRXWEMWM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Siddiqui founded Orchid the following year. She had moved to Silicon Valley from Northern Virginia after winning, in 2012,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a $100,000 grant from Thiel for aspiring entrepreneurs willing to ditch college to pursue a business idea.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Forgoing a university education was anathema to her Pakistani immigrant parents, she has said, so she applied in secret as a high school senior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OBQ6PLMGQ5GLZIMUHA25UWNEUE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Siddiqui’s parents eventually came around, and she credits her mother with being the impetus for Orchid. When Siddiqui was a child, her mother developed retinitis pigmentosa, an eye disease caused by a rare genetic mutation. Siddiqui became acutely aware that some people were “genetically privileged” — while others were not, like her mom, who was functionally blind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="1DT7A7KG9D13QAXZTN1G8ZU2DG" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“For people who haven’t had that type of tragedy hit them or their family, it’s really hard for them to relate,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B5CKL5Z4UBANTFHLHEL2PIZW5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a later stint at Stanford, where she completed degrees in computer science, Siddiqui became fascinated by the way data science was transforming biology, creating new potential applications for reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PO6ACZOZZRCD7ASCUYPQUC5X7U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;She also became steeped in a close-knit milieu of self-described builders who looked up to Thiel. Her husband is a cybersecurity entrepreneur she met while a Thiel fellow; a friend, Laura Deming, who was in Siddiqui’s Thiel Fellowship class, has been working on age-reversing technologies since she was a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JPMJKYPMPBEDFGOXF5WUQU4VXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One of Siddiqui’s early investors, billionaire Brian Armstrong, the right-leaning CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, said he invested after seeing a tweet about a class she was teaching at Stanford, called “Frontiers of Reproductive Technology.” He has tweeted that preimplantation genetic testing is part of a “Gattaca stack” — a reference to a 1997 &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177/"&gt;dystopian science fiction film&lt;/a&gt; — of emerging innovations that will “accelerate civilizational progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KKPQKLITMNGSPBOVS7CMSDXKTE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Had she not come to Silicon Valley at an early age, Siddiqui said, she would never have had the confidence to start a company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TMTWGZMVMFFOHFB3LFESAISLIU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Everyone here took me incredibly seriously as a 17-, 18-year-old, working on medical start-ups,” she said in an interview next to San Francisco’s Ferry Building. “It’s just a place where everyone has a license to do things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YAWDSHFBKJBKPLOTTH2WJQQQQA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Securing early funding from Armstrong, ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, bitcoin and genetics entrepreneur Balaji Srinivasan, 23&amp;amp;me founder Anne Wojcicki, and others, Siddiqui got to work combing through scientific literature to build the company’s proprietary polygenic scoring methods. In 2022, Orchid had what it describes as its big breakthrough: an innovation that enabled it to sequence all 3 billion base pairs of the human genome from as few as five embryonic cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WSGXNJ42NNCJ5K7FQ36HTLJMVM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the paper laying out that breakthrough, published last year in the peer-reviewed journal F&amp;amp;S Reports, is fundamentally flawed, according to Stanford’s Yatsenko and Aleks Rajkovic, chief genomics officer at the University of California at San Francisco Health Center for Clinical Genetics and Genomics. It excluded results that didn’t fit its thesis, Yatsenko said, and both scientists said that by using Orchid’s own lab to check those results, its authors didn’t adhere to ideal scientific practice. Orchid said that the paper’s findings had been verified by independent labs and that there were “zero discrepancies” in the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XDG4XRQBGZHHPH353XARIGGKUI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Todd Lencz, the leader of a federally funded research project examining polygenic embryo screening, said the science isn’t clear enough for use in a clinic. Subtle differences among different companies’ algorithms “can produce strikingly different results in clinical contexts,” said Lencz, a professor at Hofstra University’s Zucker School of Medicine. “There’s no gold-standard consensus about which method is best.” Orchid countered that slight differences in algorithms’&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;results are no argument for preventing people from benefiting from the best scientific knowledge available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TL52DJY7WZFCRNMC6XCM2J7KCM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another big issue facing Orchid and other start-ups is that polygenic scores can be up to half as accurate, according to some researchers, for some people with non-European ancestry. The primary pools of genetic data available to researchers come from European and American sources, especially the UK Biobank, a large database in the United Kingdom that includes the genetic data of a half-million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZKG574SI5BEMLG75Q3EE4POVBA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Siddiqui told The Post that Orchid is well aware of the potential for bias, noting that she is South Asian and her husband has Middle Eastern ancestry. She said the company uses standard statistical methods to correct for limitations in the scores. In some circumstances, she said, Orchid does not offer any score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ABFG5XSX7VHUNEHIMUW7P6MYLM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The data used to create risk scores draws on the genetics of people who are now adults and often elderly, and it’s unclear how much the risks faced by people now in their 70s apply to babies being born today, said Patrick Turley, a statistical-genetics researcher at the University of Southern California. Environmental factors that affect the genes of present-day embryos in-vitro, such as microplastics and endocrine-disrupting chemicals, are different from environmental factors many years ago, he added. And lifestyle and behavior, which also impact genes and life outcomes, are different today than for generations past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NOK26KISVVGIZCZOUNG2DSP5MU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s hard to make projections about how well [polygenic scores] are going to predict in the future when the world’s a different place,” Turley said, while emphasizing that genetic embryo selection could benefit certain couples, such as those who are carriers of rare diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UJPQW7WXRZHLTG4ECSZEOC7EGI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Orchid said research has shown that genetic predispositions are “remarkably stable” across decades. “Genetic signal doesn’t vanish just because the world changes,” spokeswoman Harandi-Zadeh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YZ6K2EFK3JFHFARXQOIO2Z4QJY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pachter, the Caltech computational biologist, has called Orchid’s offerings “amoral nonsense” and said conveying genetic information in numerical scores gives a certain “class of people” the illusion of more control than they really have, and validates the feeling that “one’s own genome must be special.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="9XVUTW6UMN2XQ8Y6DPYQZYRBMC" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Orchid rejected Pachter’s criticism, too. “It’s easy to moralize from an ivory tower when your child isn’t the one who might be born with a fatal disease,” Harandi-Zadeh said. “This isn’t about ‘some illusion of control.’ It’s about giving families the ability to prevent real suffering based on the most accurate information modern science can provide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="ZOLJDZ6YSVGQZOB7ET3IRF7W2Q" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="ZOLJDZ6YSVGQZOB7ET3IRF7W2Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Seeking ‘peace of mind’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-from-the-source" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3WACPVFWZ5EJDB3H4LA7LVYM7Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Roshan George, a start-up executive in San Francisco, said that when he and his wife, Julie Kang, used Orchid last year, the company’s genetic counselors gave detailed explanations about the probabilities of different predictions, emphasizing that “nothing is 100 percent certain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B7VNTC56QJDPJELTDNDVFCFO6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The couple sought out Orchid after learning, during a standard parental genetic screening process at their IVF clinic, that both were carriers of a rare genetic mutation that causes irreversible hearing loss soon after the child is born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HFA422BG3BH7PAR7CFVYPGURPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The couple’s main concern was whether they were passing the hearing loss variant on to their embryo. Though they probably could have found out by screening the embryos at an IVF clinic through standard processes, which amplify a snippet of the genome, George sought out full genome screening for “a more complete picture” and “peace of mind,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ELR6DR6X7ZCK7OMDBLKJU27O2A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;George and Kang produced 12 embryos and used Orchid to screen all of them — a cost of $30,000 on top of IVF. Six were viable. Two had the hearing loss gene variant. Another two were carriers, which meant they could pass the gene on to their children but wouldn’t be affected themselves. And two, called embryos JK3 and 6-JK in Orchid’s report, were unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OCCFSAPSJFB3ZAVI4PHXP6EGMI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The couple pored over their spreadsheets, debating which of the two to select. One embryo had a 1.5 percent lifetime risk of bipolar disorder, about half that of the general population. But its type 2 diabetes risk — 29 percent — was slightly above average, about 1.2 times that of a typical person. Another had a slightly higher risk of obesity. Given his and Kang’s ethnicities — South and East Asian, respectively — George took the predictions with “a grain of salt.” After weighing all the other factors, the polygenic scoring became “the tiebreaker,” George said. Kang gave birth in March; so far, their daughter, Astra Meridian, has perfect hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="S6BG3KPUY5F5DG7W5SU2YRAOZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The family’s experience is likely to be a window into the future, scientists said, in which an abundance of data offers families improved odds for healthy children and fraught reproductive choices. If families seek that information, the medical industry shouldn’t be “paternalistic” and deny them, UCSF’s Rajkovic said, but companies have to be careful not to promise more certainty than science can deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6XBI3P25SZCNXOK4UXUZA7GVUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Orchid’s offerings are “not ready for prime time,” according to Rajkovic. But the premise the company is pursuing — better odds for healthy babies — is “commendable in terms of pushing the barriers,” he said. “Because genetic disease can be devastating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-quote subtype-blockquote" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-testid="quote" class="wpds-c-hqmxme wpds-c-hqmxme-fDUVQq-showBorder-true wpds-c-hqmxme-iPJLV-css blockquote border-box black font--article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-contentid="EJI4M3JCCZGUJHIJAJDQ5PJWDQ" data-apitype="text" data-qa="article-quote" class="wpds-c-PJLV"&gt;&lt;b&gt;About this story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-contentid="LY2HXHBVL5D25HAN5P2SBXCHRI" data-apitype="text" data-qa="article-quote" class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-hiUTBI-isFirst-false"&gt;Nitasha Tiku contributed to this report.

First, that specific foods directly affect dreams (the “food-specific” effect); second, that certain foods cause physical discomfort, disrupting dreams (the “food distress” effect); and third, that food changes sleep quality, which in turn affects dream content (the “sleep effects” theory).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the survey were asked about their diet, food allergies, and intolerances, as well as their sleep habits and dream patterns, using tools such as the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Nightmare Disorder Index. What they found was quite illuminating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little more than 40% of survey respondents reported that food had some effect on their sleep, with 24.7% stating that certain foods worsened their sleep and 20.1% claiming some foods improved their ZZZ’s. Just 5.5% of participants reported that eating specific foods before bed directly influenced their dreams, and when it did, it tended to be linked to nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food-related nightmares were more commonly blamed on sweets (31%) and dairy products (22%). The researchers also found that people with food allergies and gluten intolerance were more likely to say their dreams were affected by food, and those with lactose intolerance were far more likely to report frequent nightmares. The likely culprit, the researchers noted, was gastrointestinal discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nightmares are worse for lactose-intolerant people who suffer severe gastrointestinal symptoms and whose sleep is disrupted,” Dr. Tore Nielsen of Université de Montréal, lead author of the study, shared in a &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/late-night-cheese-may-fuel-nightmares-new-study-explains-how/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “This makes sense, because we know that other bodily sensations can affect dreaming. Nightmares can be very disruptive, especially if they occur often, because they tend to awaken people from sleep in a dysphoric state. They might also produce sleep avoidance behaviors. Both symptoms can rob you of restful sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/fermented-foods-sleep-study-11687048" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Food Group May Be the Secret to Better Sleep, According to a New Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Food Group May Be the Secret to Better Sleep, According to a New Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these findings shouldn’t deter you from your love of cheese just yet. As Nielsen noted, his team needs to continue its work to study more people of different ages, “walks of life, and with different dietary habits to determine if our results are truly generalizable to the larger population.” He added, “Experimental studies are also needed to determine if people can truly detect the effects of specific foods on dreams.” So, he’s hoping to run a study asking people to eat cheese versus “some control food before sleep to see if this alters their sleep or dreams.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But if you’re someone who really seems to have nightmares after eating cheese, Nielsen says the answer is simple: Change your eating habits, which “could alleviate nightmares.” If you want to improve your sleep, the team found that fruit, herbal tea, and vegetables were all foods participants said helped them sleep better. But if you’re sleeping just fine after that mozzarella stick, then by all means, carry on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reviewed by&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren Manaker MS, RDN, LD, CLEC&lt;/strong&gt;: Lauren is an award-winning registered dietitian and three-time book author, with more than 22 years in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/cheese-consumption-linked-to-nightmares-11769272" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Food &amp;amp; Wine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Food &amp;amp; Wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2025 15:58:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE14OFFQQWFDN3JDdklRWS1ZT3ZPS1c2Ti1WMFlXWmFaeXk5eWVpR2N4cUhEa2N5MmNLVnQ1bGdEUHdvU1A0NllxazJaM3paeW42SGc4YUtHUkVQNHVWUE1Bc1AtTmVydHVfYURhbg</guid></item><item><title>根据新的评论， 4种可能实际上有助于抑郁症的补充剂- health.com | 4 Supplements That May Actually Help With Depression, According to a New Review - health.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE1yYVNjaUFscjI1VWQ1MUw4eDZydlljdHFtZ2tBYzBaWDFFdXowRmRpdnJlR256alVlTkp3OWlHbUdUUlkycVl3bGdFSVdkVUwyb3dhVGV3SEN6cWFTTERKYzhzQnpGQ3hrZTBKQkFHQUViZ2VZcHlF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dozens of&lt;strong&gt; supplements&lt;/strong&gt; claim to help &lt;strong&gt;alleviate depression,&lt;/strong&gt; but only a &lt;strong&gt;few are backed by research, &lt;/strong&gt;a new study found.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers in the United Kingdom reviewed hundreds of clinical trials that evaluated how well 64 different types of over-the-counter dietary supplements—from herbs to vitamins—treated depressive symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most of the research on supplements was limited, but five were significantly more studied than the others. Of those, four tended to outperform a placebo:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “I was interested in seeing whether this could be a solution for many people,” said the study’s lead author, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachaelfrost/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Rachael Frost&lt;/a&gt;, an herbal practitioner and senior lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom. “The accessibility of supplements is important—they do tend to cost less and do tend to be widely available.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Frost cautioned that she and her team did not assess the quality of the studies included. All were clinical trials—meaning they tested supplements in people—but some were large and well-designed, while others were smaller and less rigorous, she said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-most-supplements-for-depression-havent-been-studied"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With millions of social media posts from non-experts promoting products in the nearly $152 billion supplements industry, experts said it’s more important than ever to understand which are actually effective. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This study is a really helpful snapshot of where we stand with supplements for depression. &lt;strong&gt;What stood out most to me is that they looked at 64 different products but found solid evidence for only four,”&lt;/strong&gt; said &lt;a href="https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/doctors/wright-de-borrah-e/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;De Borrah Wright, MD&lt;/a&gt;, medical director of child and adolescent psychiatry inpatient service at NYC Health + Hospitals - Kings County, who was not involved with the new study.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It “highlights how important it is not to assume that every supplement on the shelf is effective,” she said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers looked at 209 trials investigating &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/magnesium-7229399" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, folic acid, cinnamon, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/best-vitamin-c-supplements-8611294" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;, prebiotics, and dozens of other supplements. Of these, 196 trials evaluated the supplements for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/depressive-disorder-overview-7100645" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; alone. Others evaluated how well these products could alleviate depression along with other mental health conditions, such as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/condition/anxiety/12-signs-you-may-have-an-anxiety-disorder" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/insomnia-symptoms-8404366" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There was little research conducted on most of the products, the team’s analysis revealed. Forty-one were each only evaluated in a single trial.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-others-are-backed-by-more-research"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Still, the new paper found that some supplements have been more extensively studied than others for their potential to ease depressive symptoms:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids. &lt;/strong&gt;These were&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;evaluated in 39 trials—more than any other product. However, the majority of those studies found that the &lt;strong&gt;supplements didn’t outperform a placebo&lt;/strong&gt; in reducing depressive symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St. John’s wort.&lt;/strong&gt; This herb is&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;derived from the yellow-flowered &lt;em&gt;Hypericum perforatum &lt;/em&gt;plant.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Many trials showed that it improved symptoms compared to a placebo, and some research has even suggested that it may be as effective as prescription antidepressants.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saffron. &lt;/strong&gt;Derived from a type of crocus flower, this spice was also studied more than many other supplements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Though early results show promise, “studies are small, and we still need more data before making strong recommendations,” Wright told &lt;em&gt;Health&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probiotics and vitamin D&lt;/strong&gt;. These also had a substantial body of research, much of it promising. For vitamin D, the benefits seem clearer in people with low levels. But “for those with normal levels, the benefit is less clear,” Wright said.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A 2024 meta-analysis suggested that high levels of vitamin D may be needed to see an effect on depressive symptoms, but excess vitamin D can be toxic and affect bone health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The following supplements had limited evidence but hinted at positive effects:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-some-supplements-could-ease-depression"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies have shown that some supplements, including &lt;strong&gt;St. John’s wort &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; saffron,&lt;/strong&gt; appear to &lt;strong&gt;regulate &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/how-to-increase-serotonin-8410186" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;serotonin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/dopamine-7254750" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;dopamine&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; two hormones related to depression.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As for &lt;strong&gt;vitamin D, &lt;/strong&gt;research has noted that receptors for the vitamin are located in several parts of the brain thought to play a role in depression, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1003153511/thea-gallagher" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Thea Gallagher, PsyD&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical psychologist at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and director of wellness programs at NYU Langone, &lt;strong&gt;probiotics&lt;/strong&gt; are a &lt;strong&gt;low-risk place to start&lt;/strong&gt; if someone would like to incorporate a supplement into their depression treatment. “That gut-brain access point, we think, is an important factor in mental health, so taking probiotics and also getting probiotics from food can be good,” she said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-are-supplements-safe"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If someone with mild or moderate—but not severe—depression would like to try supplements for their symptoms, Gallagher said taking them is likely &lt;strong&gt;low-risk. &lt;/strong&gt;Reassuringly, there “were relatively few adverse events” in the studies her paper reviewed, Frost said. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Still, "herbs and supplements can have quite a wide range of effects across different body systems,” Frost said. “It’s important to&lt;strong&gt; look at the quality of the products&lt;/strong&gt; and see if the dose you are taking aligns with the dose used in studies.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You also want to confirm that you aren’t taking medications that could interfere with the supplement—&lt;strong&gt;St. John’s wort, for example, can be dangerous &lt;/strong&gt;when mixed with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;birth control pills, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/blood-thinners-8431112" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood thinners&lt;/a&gt;, and antidepressants.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because the Food and Drug Administration doesn’t regulate most supplements for safety or efficacy, Wright recommends buying supplements with a &lt;strong&gt;seal from a third-party tester,&lt;/strong&gt; such as USP or NSF.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-remain-cautious-about-supplementsand-try-other-strategies"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though some supplements show promise for reducing depressive symptoms, how well they work compared to anti-depression drugs, such as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/ssri-8669076" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; (SSRIs), remains largely unknown, said Gallagher.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s kind of the wild wild west with understanding supplements, and we are trying to learn a lot more about how they work and what they do,” Gallagher told &lt;em&gt;Health&lt;/em&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s possible the well-documented placebo effect could be influencing some of the evidence in favor of supplements—but this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, she noted. “If supplements are part of you turning over a new leaf of taking better care of your health, that can be part and parcel good for depression,” she said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Still, Gallagher cautioned people to &lt;strong&gt;be critical of what they see online.&lt;/strong&gt; “There are a lot of influencers that are getting paid to say something has worked for them, but the problem when you come from the science and research side, we don’t find that the scientific findings are robust enough for us to recommend,” she said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For people with even mild to moderate depression, “supplements alone are probably not going to help you,” she added. And if you’re trying to avoid prescription medication, it’s especially important to &lt;strong&gt;maintain healthy habits&lt;/strong&gt; like “eating regular, substantive meals, getting good sleep, [and] getting 150 minutes of exercise per week,” she said.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Many Americans today are living with obesity, even with the advent of newer, more effective drugs like semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy). It’s a problem that seems to be getting especially serious in kids, however. Research out today finds that the percentage of children with “extremely severe” obesity has surged in the U.S. over the past decade and a half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California San Diego led the study, which examined nationally representative data of Americans’ health. Between 2008 and 2023, the rate of extreme obesity among U.S. children increased more than threefold, they found. The findings highlight a growing public health emergency, the researchers say, given the much higher prevalence of liver and other health problems among this group of children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“[They’re] developing adult-type complications—fatty liver scarring, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome—years before graduation. These conditions track into adulthood and shorten life expectancy,” lead author Phillipp Hartmann, an assistant adjunct professor of pediatrics at UCSD, told Gizmodo. “Treating them strains families, clinics, and the health care system.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hartmann runs a weekly liver clinic at Rady Children’s Hospital San Diego, where he helps treat children with metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), more commonly known as fatty liver. These children typically have obesity as well, and Hartmann began to notice that the most obese children tended to have the worst liver inflammation and scarring. These cases prompted him and his colleagues to wonder whether the current system for diagnosing obesity in children might be outdated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obesity in children is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bmi/child-teen-calculator/bmi-categories.html"&gt;defined&lt;/a&gt; as having a body mass index that’s at least in the 95th percentile for children of that specific age and sex. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classifies severe obesity as having a BMI 120% of the 95th percentile or greater (alternatively, a BMI of 35 or greater). The American Academy of Pediatrics has two separate categories (Class 2 and 3) for severe obesity, with the highest having a BMI 140% of the 95th percentile or greater (or a BMI of 40 and above). But the study researchers argue these distinctions still aren’t enough to capture the unique added risks seen in the most profound cases of obesity. They’ve proposed two more classes, which they’ve coined extremely severe obesity. Class 4 would be having a BMI between 160% and 180% of the 95th percentile, while class 5 obesity would be having a BMI 180% of the 95th percentile or greater.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To validate their argument, the researchers analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative poll of Americans’ dieting and lifestyle habits regularly run by the CDC. As expected, they found that children with extremely severe obesity had much higher rates of diagnosed metabolic disease than children with less severe obesity. They were roughly sevenfold more likely to have fatty liver, eight times more likely to have severe insulin resistance, and ten times more likely to have advanced liver scarring, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They also found that around 1.13% of children in 2023 met the criteria for extremely severe obesity. While that’s still a small figure overall, it’s more than triple the percentage seen in 2008 (0.32%). With roughly &lt;a href="http://The%20U.S.%20population%20age%2065%20and%20older%20rose%20by%203.1%%20(to%2061.2%20million)%20while%20the%20population%20under%20age%2018%20decreased%20by%200.2%%20(to%2073.1%20million)%20from%202023%20to%202024,%20according%20to%20the%20Vintage%202024%20Population%20Estimates%20released%20today%20by%20the%20U.S.%20Census%20Bureau."&gt;73 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; under 18 living in the U.S. today, that’s about 825,000 children who have extremely severe obesity. Rates of extremely severe obesity were higher among teens, boys, and non-Hispanic Black children. The team’s findings were &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.21170?guestAccessKey=992d125b-472d-43f8-a103-44c240b6d0f7&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=071625"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in JAMA Network Open.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Kids already well above a healthy weight keep climbing higher,” said Hartmann. “They now make up more than one out of every 90 children, and the trend continues to go up.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Pediatric obesity in the U.S. has been on the rise, with about 19% of children affected today. And some of the reasons behind this overall rise, such as more children eating diets rich in calories and ultra-processed foods, likely also help explain why extremely severe obesity is climbing in kids, too. But there might be other factors involved for a subset of children, Hartmann notes, including a genetic vulnerability or the aftereffects of the pandemic on their stress and sleeping habits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Because these pressures overlap, weight gain is not merely a personal choice issue but a complex, environment-driven problem,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There has been some &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/good-and-bad-news-on-the-obesity-front-in-the-u-s-2000502586"&gt;positive news&lt;/a&gt; about obesity in America lately. The latest CDC data shows that the national obesity rate has finally stopped climbing, at least in adults. Some of this decline is likely driven by the emergence of more effective GLP-1 medications like semaglutide. But the same data also suggests that severe obesity hasn’t yet stalled. And as powerful as these newer drugs are, many people haven’t been able to access them due to shortages or their high costs and limited insurance coverage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hartmann says interventions like clearer product labeling, healthy food subsidies, and community programs emphasizing physical activity can possibly help prevent childhood obesity from happening in the first place. Programs that screen for fatty liver and other metabolic diseases may also be able to keep these cases from worsening. But ultimately, children living with extremely severe obesity need greater access to obesity treatment, which can include family-oriented lifestyle programs, new and older medications, and, for some cases, bariatric surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Given the limited availability of novel, highly effective weight-loss medications such as semaglutide, I strongly believe that patients—especially pediatric patients—with classes 4 and 5 obesity, who carry by far the highest health risks, should be prioritized for access to these treatments,” Hartmann said. “I hope our study encourages the development of clinical trials specifically tailored to this high-risk population. We would be very interested in serving as a participating site for such a trial.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, Hartmann and his team will continue to investigate other aspects of extremely severe pediatric obesity, including whether the microbiomes of these children are distinct from others.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY, Fla. — Florida health officials are warning residents after a flesh-eating bacteria has already killed four people, including one in the Tampa Bay area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Florida Department of Health is &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/vibrio-infections/vibrio-vulnificus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; that there have been deaths in Bay, Broward, St. Johns and Hillsborough counties in 2025. This includes 11 cases reported throughout the state this year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bacteria, known as Vibrio Vulnificus, are a rare infection that lives in warm seawater and are part of a group of bacteria called “halophilic” because they require salt.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida DOH said not to enter waters if you have fresh cuts or scrapes. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're immunocompromised, including if you have chronic liver disease, kidney disease or a weakened immune system, you should wear proper foot protection to prevent cuts and injury caused by rocks and shells on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vibrio vulnificus can also cause illness when ingested, sometimes in raw shellfish like oysters.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tips to prevent flesh-eating bacteria infections&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="isPasted"&gt;Do not eat raw oysters or other raw shellfish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cook shellfish (oysters, clams, mussels) thoroughly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For shellfish in the shell, either boil until the shells open and continue boiling for five more minutes, or steam until the shells open and then continue cooking for nine more minutes. Do not eat those shellfish that do not open during cooking. Boil shucked oysters at least three minutes, or fry them in oil at least 10 minutes at 375°F.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid cross-contamination of cooked seafood and other foods with raw seafood and juices from raw seafood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat shellfish promptly after cooking and refrigerate leftovers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid exposure of open wounds or broken skin to warm salt or brackish water, or to raw shellfish harvested from such waters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear protective clothing (e.g., gloves) when handling raw shellfish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
