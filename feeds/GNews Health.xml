But there's good news: HPV vaccinations can help prevent cervical cancer, as well as a host of other cancers caused by HPV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine, coupled with regular screening – including a new at-home option – and checkups are the best way to reduce the risk of cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cervical cancer occurs when cells grow abnormally in the cervix," said Stephanie Henderson, MD, medical director for gynecology at Intermountain Health who is based in the Salt Lake City area. "This process usually takes several years, allowing a large window of opportunity to detect and treat abnormal cells early."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;January is national Cervical Cancer Awareness Month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cervical cancer is the fourth-most common cancer in women around the world. More than 13,000 women in the United States are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year, a number that has decreased dramatically over the past 50 years thanks to improved screening and the development of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly all cervical cancers are caused by HPV, a group of more than 200 common and highly contagious viruses. HPV, which also causes five other cancers, has been found in body fluids such as saliva, semen, and vaginal fluid but is most often passed from one person to another through direct physical contact. It is a common cause of genital warts and can infect the cells of the mouth, throat, genitals and anus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Historically, about 85% of all people, male and female, will be infected with HPV during their lifetime," Henderson said. "Fortunately, most people will recover from the virus before it causes any significant problems. The HPV vaccine helps people fight off HPV infection and helps prevent an HPV infection from progressing to precancer or cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research shows when detected early, five-year cervical cancer survival is higher than 90%. Yet more than half of all cervical cancer diagnoses are made beyond an early stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3 ways to reduce your risk of cervical cancer:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get the HPV vaccine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the HPV vaccine for both boys and girls between the ages of 9-12 years old, because the vaccine is most effective when administered long before exposure to HPV. More than 135 million doses of the HPV vaccine have been safely administered in the U.S. alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccinating our sons and daughters at the recommended ages can help keep them healthy well into adulthood, and is the best way to prevent HPV-related cancers later in life," said Tamara Sheffield, MD, medical director of immunization programs for Intermountain Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adolescents and adults can get the HPV vaccine up to age 45. Check with your trusted women's health or primary care provider if you haven't received it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Begin getting a Pap smear screening at age 21&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This screening checks the cervix for abnormal cells that can become cancer.  Pap smear screenings are recommended once every three years for women ages 21-29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From ages 30-65, women can continue to have a Pap test every five years with HPV testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Screen for HPV at a checkup or with an FDA-approved home-test option&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines for cervical cancer screening were recently updated by the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration to include a new home-test option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are many tools to help prevent cervical cancer, and one of those is an FDA-approved HPV test that can be used at home by women over age 30," said  Henderson. "We're excited about home HPV tests since they can remove barriers to help more women get screened, but it's important that FDA-approved tests are used and directions are followed precisely for accurate results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask your health provider if self-swab collection is recommended and available in your area, and check to see if it's covered by your insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's also important to follow up with a women's health provider about Pap smear or HPV test results so you know what type of screening and frequency of screening is recommended in the future, based on your age and medical history," Henderson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who is at risk for cervical cancer?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women who smoke are almost twice as likely to get cervical cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women who become sexually active before age 18 are more likely to contract the HPV virus. Women with multiple sexual partners are also more likely to contract the HPV virus and develop cervical cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women with a weakened immune system have a greater risk of cervical cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information or to find a provider, visit Intermountain's women's health page at &lt;a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/services/womens-health" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;intermountainhealth.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opinions and conclusions expressed in this article are the sponsor's own and do not reflect the views or opinions of KSL.com.

Kennedy Jr.’s Make America Healthy Again sees for all of the country’s medical problems, it’s food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Borrowing a phrase that has become ubiquitous in health policy circles and the influencer ecosystem that drives so much of our discourse these days around health and wellness, Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/food-medicine-takes-shape-rfk-jr-praises-school-menu-changes-west-virginia"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt;: “Food is medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And this month’s release of &lt;a href="https://cdn.realfood.gov/DGA.pdf"&gt;new dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for the country portrayed better eating as the cure to America’s chronic disease crisis. “My message is clear: Eat real food,” Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/press-secretary-karoline-leavitt-briefs-members-of-the-media-jan-7-2026/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; when announcing his new inverted food pyramid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It is a message that resonates — and for good reason. Many chronic health problems, from hypertension to diabetes, can be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9921002/"&gt;the consequences of a poor diet&lt;/a&gt;. Ultra-processed foods have been the target of criticism not just from Kennedy but a wide range of &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/public-health/prevention-wellness/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-ultraprocessed-foods"&gt;medical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/ultraprocessed-foods-bad-for-you"&gt;public health groups&lt;/a&gt; in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But there’s a major problem with Kennedy’s vision: Simply insisting that people “eat real food” does not make it any easier for them to find or afford nutrient-rich meals in a country where most grocery stores are awash in fatty, sugary, and salty treats and over-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Instead, he places the onus for healthy eating on the consumer rather than focusing on improving the food environment that makes it so hard for many Americans to eat healthy diets in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It’s part of the whole MAHA movement to promote individual responsibility. That’s the constant mantra.&lt;em&gt; Do your own research&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;make your own personal decision&lt;/em&gt; about how you feel about these things, irrespective of the science,” said Marion Nestle, a long-time nutrition policy researcher at New York University. “But we know from decades, and decades, and decades of research that individual responsibility is not enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-hidden-meaning-in-rfk-jr-s-food-is-medicine-message" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The hidden meaning in RFK Jr.’s “food is medicine” message&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even though doctors and nutritionists have been clear about the negative impacts of consuming too much ultra-processed foods, Kennedy’s were the first federal guidelines to discourage eating them. He gets credit for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the guidelines themselves &lt;a href="/future-perfect/474554/food-pyramid-dietary-guidelines-maha-protein"&gt;are still a bit wacky&lt;/a&gt;. They overemphasize protein based on the latest nutrition science, set unrealistic expectations around a “zero sugar” diet for kids, and endorse certain foods — specifically beef tallow — that continue to befuddle even the nutrition experts who largely agree with the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="sign-up-for-the-good-medicine-newsletter" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Sign up for the Good Medicine newsletter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;Our political wellness landscape has shifted: new leaders, shady science, contradictory advice, broken trust, and overwhelming systems. How is anyone supposed to make sense of it all? Vox’s senior correspondent &lt;a href="/authors/dylan-scott"&gt;Dylan Scott&lt;/a&gt; has been on the health beat for more than a decade, and every week, he’ll wade into sticky debates, answer fair questions, and contextualize what’s happening in American health care policy. Sign up &lt;a href="/pages/good-medicine-newsletter-signup"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;By adopting fairly conventional dietary advice, Kennedy has attracted widespread support for his food agenda. I spoke with a number of nutrition experts who, while uncomfortable with Kennedy’s actions on, for example, vaccines, still feel his tenure represents an opportunity to improve people’s eating habits and, as Kennedy himself would say, to address the underlying issues driving up rates of diabetes, hypertension, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Ideally, they told me, we could have the best of both worlds: a healthy eating agenda that everyone from Kennedy and MAHA to the American Medical Association and American Academy of Pediatrics could get on board with, while embracing the best public health practices that have proven their value over the last half century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But there’s a very real risk here, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The problem with labeling food as medicine, as Kennedy does, is it could be construed as meaning food &lt;em&gt;instead of&lt;/em&gt; medicine. And that indeed is his administration’s implied message, as they cast doubt on &lt;a href="/health/471362/rfk-jr-vaccine-committee-hepatitis-b-shot"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/07/rfk-jr-antidepressants-teenagers-warnings/"&gt;antidepressants&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="/health/462311/trump-tylenol-autism-announcement-leucovorin"&gt;Tylenol&lt;/a&gt;: Embrace nutrient-rich foods, but avoid pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Can you use diet to manage all clinical conditions without needing traditional pharma treatments? I think obviously the answer is no,” said Seth Berkowitz, a University of North Carolina doctor who has developed “food is medicine” programs. “It would be problematic to say, ‘Well, I don’t need to take X, Y, Z, I’m gonna do everything through diet.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This is already happening. Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.unmc.edu/healthsecurity/transmission/2025/03/04/as-measles-spreads-kennedy-embraces-remedies-like-cod-liver-oil/"&gt;embraced&lt;/a&gt; vitamin A and cod liver oil over vaccines during last year’s measles outbreak in Texas. And it is in line with the more outlandish wellness trends you will find on social media, like people eating &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/2024/10/should-you-be-eating-activated-charcoal"&gt;activated charcoal&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes they will purge their body of toxins, that have taken the “food is medicine” concept to illogical extremes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-a-real-food-is-medicine-strategy-would-look-like" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What a real “food is medicine” strategy would look like&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Under Kennedy’s conception of “food as medicine,” &lt;a href="https://realfood.gov/"&gt;it’s on you&lt;/a&gt;, the individual, to put that practice into action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The problem is the prescription for better eating has been tried — and has failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Many of us are living in “food swamps,” as nutritionists call them. Our local grocers and corner stores are stocked with cheap, unhealthy snacks and pre-made meals; the convenience of fast food restaurants are a short drive or walk away. Ultra-processed foods, especially those high in fats and sugars, are literally &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-makes-ultraprocessed-foods-addictive/"&gt;addictive&lt;/a&gt;. Their advertising is ubiquitous, flush with bright colors and cartoon mascots, and often, unhealthy foods are deceptively billed with health-conscious branding (I’m thinking of my beloved SmartFood white cheddar popcorn).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Food is medicine,” as conceived by Kennedy, “frames poor diet as an individual problem that can be solved by the health care system or medical establishment, when it is a societal problem to be solved by these commercial determinants of health,” said Alyssa Moran, a nutrition policy researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. “But it does appeal to the people already looking for a natural cure and natural treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If we are serious about trying to address people’s healthy eating, we need to turn the country’s many food swamps into food oases that can make it truly feasible for people to eat healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And, on that front, Kennedy has had conspicuously little to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some nutrition experts do support the Trump administration’s efforts to limit what kind of foods can be purchased with food stamps (though the president has also signed off on significant cuts to the program). The new dietary guidelines will affect — and ultimately improve — which foods can be funded through the national school lunch program and the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Those are small wins that some nutritionists have long sought. But they are hardly a cohesive plan to make healthy food more accessible and, as importantly, affordable. And the risks of steering people away from effective conventional medical care could outweigh the positive by warning people off ultra-processed snacks and toward whole fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even so, food &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be medicine — in the proper context. But what Kennedy means by “food is medicine” is not the same as what the American Heart Association or other clinicians mean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here are a few telling examples: In the 1980s and ’90s, community groups and local governments worked together to tailor meal programs for HIV patients who had no support for food shopping or preparation because of social stigma. The programs were narrowly focused, getting the right kind of food to a particularly at-risk population, seeking to overcome some of the structural barriers to their eating well. And today, Kevin Volpp, who is helping oversee a “food is medicine” initiative at the American Heart Association, which received support from the Biden administration, said their pilot programs aimed at getting whole foods to heart disease patients and those with uncontrolled diabetes were seeing “high follow-up rates, high customer satisfaction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;At the same time, a structural overhaul of food regulations — from what ingredients are permitted to who can purchase unhealthy foods to how foods are advertised — could help address the root causes of the chronic disease crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some of the experts I spoke with sincerely want to see a ban on the most harmful ultra-processed foods being sold to minors, like tobacco or alcohol.

itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have discovered a 'direct' link between aging gut bacteria and the body's failing ability to repair itself, pinpointing a key driver of physical decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is a 'direct' link between the collection of bacteria in your gut and how well your cells age, new research shows, suggesting that maintaining a healthy gut microbiome can have a major impact on a person's health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gut microbiome is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14090667/The-ultimate-guide-keeping-healthy-gut-symptoms-experts-say-NEVER-ignore.html"&gt;a complex ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; of trillions of microorganisms - both beneficial and harmful. It is a central regulator of human health, influencing everything from immune function and metabolism to mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And now, researchers from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/germany/index.html" id="mol-26796c20-f7ad-11f0-be49-a76661e62523"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and the US have pinpointed a critical mechanism linking microbial balance to tissue health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their work reveals that intestinal stem cells, responsible for continuously rebuilding the gut lining, become less active with age, leading to cellular breakdown and a weakened intestinal barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This age-related decline coincides with a significant disruption in the delicate balance of the gut microbiome, which is increasingly being associated with chronic disease and the rise of colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-d94dc3f0-f7bc-11f0-be49-a76661e62523"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the balance between beneficial and harmful bacteria changes, the communication between microbes and stem cells breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This deterioration is believed to trigger a cascade of body-wide inflammation, a major driver of age-related decline. The findings provide a scientific foundation for the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15470619/The-six-WORST-foods-gut-health-revealed-experts-bad-news-youre-fan-sliced-bread-fizzy-drinks-oysters.html"&gt;booming gut-health trend&lt;/a&gt;, showing that the microbiome does far more than aid digestion - it appears to directly regulate tissue repair and cellular aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Actor and wellness guru Gwyneth Paltrow is a long-time fan of the probiotic brand Seed, which runs for about $60 for a month's supply&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To pinpoint the connection between gut bacteria and aging at the cellular level, the researchers designed a series of experiments, primarily using mice. They first confirmed that the gut microbiomes of young and old mice were distinctly different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, to test cause and effect, they performed a microbiome transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They gave old mice a course of antibiotics to clear their existing gut bacteria, then repopulated their systems with gut microbes from young donor mice, a process called fecal microbiota transfer, or FMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also performed the reverse, giving young mice the microbiome of old donors. To measure the impact, they tracked two key things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, they analyzed gene activity in the intestinal stem cells and in the specialized ‘nurse’ cells, called Paneth cells, that sit beside them in the intestinal wall, focusing on a crucial rejuvenation signal called the Wnt pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Second, they used several high-tech methods to directly measure the gut lining's ability to regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This included tracking newly born cells as they migrated up the millions of tiny, finger-like projections, or villi, that line the intestine and absorb nutrients, a direct measure of how quickly the lining was being renewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a final, targeted experiment, they isolated a specific bacterium, Akkermansia muciniphila, that becomes more prevalent with age and fed it to mice to observe its specific effect on the stem cells' function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kourtney Kardashian's supplement brand Lemme markets a popular probiotic for $30&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results show that old gut bacteria make the gut age faster but young bacteria can turn back the clock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When scientists gave older mice the gut bacteria of young mice, the activity of the critical Wnt signaling pathway was restored and the older mice’s intestines started repairing themselves as if they were young again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their gut-healing cells became more active and better at regenerating tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, giving young mice an ‘aged’ microbiome only slightly reduced their stem cell function, suggesting a young gut environment is more resilient to decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found that Akkermansia muciniphila naturally increased in the guts of older mice. When they directly fed this bacterium to old mice, it further suppressed the Wnt pathway while reducing the stem cells’ ability to regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most significant finding in the study, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/stem-cell-reports/fulltext/S2213-6711(25)00392-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2213671125003923%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Stem Cell Reports&lt;/a&gt; was that the decline in the gut’s ability to repair itself is not an irreversible symptom of aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Changing the microbiome, specifically by introducing a younger community of bacteria, can restore the function of aged stem cells to full health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gut microbiome, therefore, is a central regulator of the aging process, helping to renew tissues. This also offers a potential target for interventions aimed at slowing age-related degenerative changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The wellness industry has embraced a growing awareness of the importance of trying these interventions, including by taking probiotic and prebiotic supplements, eating fermented foods, eating a high-fiber diet and human fecal microbiome transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Paltrow is seen above in a TikTok post that promoted Seed probiotics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest study shows that gut microbiome imbalance not only influences health and cellular aging but also the onset of chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is a key driver of age-related health issues and interventions have to do more than just add beneficial bacteria. They may need to fundamentally reset the entire microbial community to a more youthful state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Probiotics are one of America’s best-selling supplements, marketed for benefits ranging from improved digestion and skin health to better weight management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Millions of Americans invest heavily in these supplements, which can cost up to $60 per month’s supply, hoping to support their gut health and overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Probiotics consist of live bacteria or yeast designed to supplement and balance the natural microbiome in the digestive system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their popularity has surged alongside growing public awareness of gut health and the rise of wellness influencers on platforms like TikTok, where gut-focused content reaches millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whether they truly are effective is up for debate, but their growing popularity has influenced and expanded the number of studies into their connections to cognitive and mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some have shown promising links between certain probiotic strains and reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression, improved mood regulation and even subtle enhancements in cognitive functions like memory and focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 19:22:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOUDdWbmQyV3NubkhwanVtczBIbjV3SldpREhtZWRPV0pWTGFoTWtRdDRsOFV0RVRXNmNiQUV1eWNWUmRpcjlzZmpTbEZsV3FWNkJWRHgxSXB6OTdUNzFJVDBFN0lIX0RGU2VYbUQwaTRRQk1FUVczN21MRmM2NWVJYkF0TzZXXy0xdHBsOGR5TVVFakxTazZLaV96MFRfdW94RFgzTlBR0gGrAUFVX3lxTFBQb3I5WGU5cmdJbUlwTzhuLWF0VjV4YTNyYk1NQ0IxalJieXd6MFdjOTdNd0p5eGQzT1NhTmtVV3BBVXJuMVdTTDBIRE1DOXljN3RfRGgxcElQQzVQTEstM1Bvbm5SRm5sVWV4SGdPWUNFZnN1bFNuUmFWNkZ3RllhVUR2aFJ5Y0NycUZCX1RhUWhnX3hIcllGbGQ4Vll0TnphYjRObGdsdE02OA</guid></item><item><title>心脏病死亡人数下降。以下是如何降低头号杀手NPR的风险</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2026/01/22/nx-s1-5685136/heart-disease-deaths-prevention-american-heart-association</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;About every 34 seconds, someone, somewhere in the United States dies from heart disease — which remains the leading cause of death for both men and women, according to the American Heart Association. But a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/heart-disease-stroke-deaths-down-yet-still-kill-more-in-u-s-than-any-other-cause" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the AHA says deaths caused by strokes and other heart conditions are on the decline.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There were about 25,000 fewer deaths from cardiovascular disease and strokes in 2023, compared to 2022, the most recent data available, the annual report released Wednesday says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Deaths due to heart disease rose during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think the last five years, as health overall was impacted by the COVID pandemic, was something of an anomaly," says &lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/katz-institute-for-womens-health/news/the-latest/american-heart-assoc-names-stacey-rosen-2021-physician-of-the-year#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDr.,steadfast%20commitment%20to%20her%20patients.%E2%80%9D&amp;amp;text=Women's%20health%20needs%20are%20unique,Center%20to%20make%20an%20appointment.&amp;amp;text=Request%20an%20appointment-,Dr.,Please%20enable%20it%20to%20continue." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Stacey Rosen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist who is the executive director of the Katz Institute for Women's Health at Northwell Health in New York, and the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/around-the-aha/new-aha-president-driven-by-fairness-doing-right-by-patients" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;president of the American Heart Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So, what will it take to keep the positive momentum going?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rosen says a preventive strategy should encompass the health care system and each person as an individual — and it should focus on the conditions that set the stage for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For instance, everyone should know whether or not they have high blood pressure — also known as hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When you look at the U.S. statistics, there's actually almost 50% of Americans who have the diagnosis of hypertension," says Rosen. "And it is truly, aside from quitting tobacco, the most modifiable risk that we have."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many people don't realize they have high blood pressure because it doesn't bring on any specific symptoms. That's why check-ups are important — and the good news is that treating high blood pressure with medicine and lifestyle changes can literally prevent heart disease, explains &lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=25223" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Sadiya Khan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Northwestern University. She's part of the team behind the new report.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Improving high blood pressure with medicine has never been easier," Khan says. "There are so &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/07/nx-s1-5532108/the-silent-killer-increases-your-risk-of-stroke-and-dementia-heres-how-to-control-it#:~:text=According%20to%20NPR%2C%20hypertension%20is%20known%20as,*%20Limiting%20alcohol%20consumption%20*%20Stress%20reduction" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;many inexpensive therapies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; available, and getting blood pressure under control can add years to life as well as prevent heart disease, stroke and dementia."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Two more drivers of heart disease are obesity and diabetes, which can also be managed with a combination of medicines and changes in lifestyle habits including eating better and moving more. Community-level policy changes, like adding green spaces where people can exercise safely is important, Khan says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Having environments that promote activity can help us make healthier choices," Khan says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Public health experts have laid out&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.125.012625" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; lots of ideas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of policy changes that could support healthy communities and help lower the risk of heart disease. Initiatives include things like reducing sodium in the food supply (given excess salt in food is a driver of hypertension), and expanding health care initiatives focused on diabetes prevention, obesity treatment, and financial incentives to achieve cardiovascular risk factor reduction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;""There are many options and ways to move forward," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/parekh-anand.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Anand Parekh&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Michigan. Parekh &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.125.012625" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote the policy paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the AHA. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;None of us can make policy changes on our own, but there are lots of opportunities to tweak our daily habits in a way that can protect our hearts. The American Heart Association promotes&lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; "Life's Essential 8&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;," which includes a focus on diet, physical activity, sleep, quitting tobacco, as well as managing blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol and weight.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's tremendous data that shows the importance of Life's Essential 8," says Rosen, pointing to the "enormous" impact in reducing your risk of heart disease by following this advice.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Changing your habits can feel overwhelming, so Rosen recommends starting with small, specific, bite-sized goals: "So rather than saying, 'I'm going to lose weight', 'I'm going to exercise more', say 'I'm going to take the stairs twice a day, every day', 'I'm going to not have a breadbasket if I go out for a meal'."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Celebrating small wins is a nice on-ramp to healthier habits, which can help fend off heart disease. Rosen points to an example in her own life, when the evidence became clear that sufficient sleep can help protect the heart.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was somebody who didn't focus on sleep as being a personal priority," she says. A few years ago she changed her habits and routines, aiming to get plenty of rest . "It has absolutely made a difference."&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The first known outbreak of syphilis in Europe began at the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/2000-year-old-bones-undermine-myth-about-columbus-and-syphilis"&gt;turn of the 16th century&lt;/a&gt;, but on the distant continent of South America, the pathogen's history goes much deeper than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 5,500-year-old skeleton discovered at an archaeological site in Colombia has now offered up DNA from the spiral-shaped bacterium &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treponema_pallidum"&gt;Treponema pallidum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This strain, called TE1-3, is not in circulation today, but based on its genome, it belongs to a very old branch, or an "early-diverging sister lineage" of &lt;em&gt;T. pallidum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems to have split off before other subspecies responsible for diseases like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis"&gt;syphilis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/yaws"&gt;yaws&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonvenereal_endemic_syphilis"&gt;bejel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinta_(disease)"&gt;pinta&lt;/a&gt; emerged and spread around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-shows-just-how-bad-syphilis-got-in-london-in-the-late-18th-century"&gt;Study Reveals Just How Bad Syphilis Got in London in The Late 18th Century&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery, led by evolutionary genomics researcher Davide Bozzi, pushes back the evidence for treponemal diseases, as they're known, by roughly 3,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also points to an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/2000-year-old-bones-undermine-myth-about-columbus-and-syphilis"&gt;origin for syphilis&lt;/a&gt; in the Americas rather than &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-may-have-been-completely-wrong-about-the-origins-of-syphilis-in-europe"&gt;in Europe&lt;/a&gt;, adding to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-confirms-syphilis-was-active-in-the-americas-long-before-columbus"&gt;growing genetic evidence&lt;/a&gt; elsewhere in South and Central America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe, the first outbreaks of syphilis occurred just after the Italian explorer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus"&gt;Christopher Columbus&lt;/a&gt; returned from his journey to the Americas, and as a result, the two events have been historically tied together – a knot firmly &lt;a href="https://oyc.yale.edu/history/hist-234/lecture-12"&gt;tightened by racist and xenophobic ideologies&lt;/a&gt; about the way diseases spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, genomic researchers are picking apart these deep and twisted roots using ancient DNA. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-confirms-syphilis-was-active-in-the-americas-long-before-columbus"&gt;Growing evidence&lt;/a&gt; from ancient bones suggests that syphilis-like diseases were present in the Americas long before their likeness emerged in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189741" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189741" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/HumanRemainsBrazilSyphilis-642x260.jpg" alt="Brazil Skeleton " class="size-medium wp-image-189741" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/HumanRemainsBrazilSyphilis-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/HumanRemainsBrazilSyphilis-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/HumanRemainsBrazilSyphilis-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/HumanRemainsBrazilSyphilis.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189741" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Pre-Columbian skeleton in Brazil found containing evidence of an ancient bacterial subspecies related to syphilis (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/2000-year-old-bones-undermine-myth-about-columbus-and-syphilis"&gt;Jose Filippini&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unknown whether TE1-3 was spread from human to human via sexual activity, as is the case with syphilis, or by skin-to-skin contact, as is the case with yaws, bejel, and pinta. But based on its genome, this ancient strain possessed virulence genes found in modern versions, which suggests it was harmful – or at least had already adapted to infect human hosts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on their results, Bozzi and colleagues estimate that the divergence between TE1-3 and other &lt;em&gt;T. pallidum&lt;/em&gt; lineages occurred roughly 13,700 years ago – well before agricultural expansion in the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that contagious diseases were emerging among hunter-gatherer communities before the rise of dense farming populations living close to domesticated animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our findings show how even a single ancient pathogen genome can shift current understanding of pathogen emergence," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adw3020"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just because the oldest known evidence for a syphilis-like disease was found in South America doesn't mean it was solely confined to this one continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While controversial, a subset of scientists working in Europe &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-may-have-been-completely-wrong-about-the-origins-of-syphilis-in-europe"&gt;maintains&lt;/a&gt; that treponemal diseases and strains closely related to syphilis were present in Europe centuries before Columbus set sail for the Americas, suggesting that &lt;em&gt;T. pallidum&lt;/em&gt; was present on both continents before Columbus's&lt;span&gt; journey connected the two.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Besides, there's even a chance that the expression of syphilis &lt;span&gt;and other treponemal diseases is &lt;/span&gt;environmentally and socially determined. &lt;span&gt;In other words, the bacterium may have been present in various populations but began to spread in different ways, and cause variations of the same disease, depending on environmental conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means the pathogen behind syphilis may not have been a sexually transmitted infection in pre-Columbian populations in the Americas; it may have later acquired this mode of transmission – and the stigma associated with it – in 15th-century Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without more evidence, all of these hypotheses remain possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a related &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aee7963"&gt;perspective&lt;/a&gt;, anthropologists Molly Zuckerman of Mississippi State University and Lydia Bailey of the US National Museum of Natural History, who were not involved in the recent research, argue that these findings "make it possible to move beyond simplistic ideas of where diseases geographically come from."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Framing &lt;em&gt;Treponema&lt;/em&gt; origins through geographic binaries, such as 'Old World' versus 'New World,' obscures the ecological realities," they &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aee4609"&gt;continue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Far from static or specific to a human population or environment, pathogens are tethered to mobile human and animal hosts and reservoirs, molded by human experiences and biosocial and environmental conditions, adaptable, and globalized."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adw3020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A rare but potentially deadly fungal infection known as histoplasmosis is sickening a cluster of people in Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dozens of histoplasmosis cases have been reported in middle Tennessee since last fall, according to local health officials, while one woman may have died as a result. As of yet, officials have not identified a clear source of the cluster, though the infection is not transmittable between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A hidden danger&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/histoplasmosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20373495"&gt;Histoplasmosis&lt;/a&gt; is caused by inhaling spores of the Histoplasma fungus (typically the species &lt;em&gt;Histoplasma capsulatum&lt;/em&gt;). Most people are not sickened by these exposures, but sometimes the infection causes relatively mild pneumonia, leading to symptoms such as fever, cough, chest pain, and body aches. In rare cases, the infection can linger in the lungs and become a chronic problem or even spread to other parts of the body, like the brain, and cause serious, life-threatening illness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In early December 2025, the Tennessee Department of Health &lt;a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/program-areas/TNHAN_Histoplasmosis.pdf"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a health advisory to clinicians and labs in the state, warning of increased acute and severe histoplasmosis cases in Williamson and Maury County. At the time, it reported 18 known cases. A spokesperson for the Tennessee Department of Health told Gizmodo on Thursday that this tally is now at 36.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week, the family of Alyssia Brown, a resident from Spring Hill, &lt;a href="https://fox17.com/news/local/spring-hill-woman-dies-as-tennessee-investigates-histoplasmosis-cluster"&gt;came forward&lt;/a&gt; to the media to discuss her case and a possibly related death.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Brown’s symptoms reportedly began soon after she moved into her new home in October 2025. She experienced a chronic cough that refused to go away. Eventually, on December 8, she visited an emergency room, where she was diagnosed with bronchitis and prescribed a steroid medication. Her condition continued to worsen, and she passed away on December 15.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Prior to her death, she sought medical care again and requested that doctors test her for histoplasmosis, having heard about the cluster. According to her family and roommate, the test came back positive for the fungus on December 18. Local detectives are investigating Brown’s death, and her family is still awaiting her autopsy results, the New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/histoplasmosis-outbreak-tennessee.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mystery source&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A potential origin for these cases hasn’t been identified as of yet, and it’s possible that one will never be located, given the nature of this fungus, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Histoplasmosis is commonly found throughout the soil in Tennessee, so it can be challenging to completely prevent exposure,” the Tennessee Department of Health representative told Gizmodo. Like many fungal infections, though, severe cases are more likely to occur in people with weakened immune systems. People exposed to high levels of the fungus are also at greater risk of severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, the fungus is known to thrive in soil that’s been saturated with bird or bat droppings, and bats are thought to be an important vector for transmission. Previous outbreaks of histoplasmosis have been linked to bat exposure. Last year, for instance, doctors &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/u-s-family-infected-with-airborne-fungal-disease-after-touring-bat-filled-caves-2000605418"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; how 12 out of 13 members of a single family developed the infection after visiting the bat-colonized Venado Caves in Costa Rica during a vacation. People in the U.S. have also contracted histoplasmosis from using &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/bat-poop-fertilizer-blamed-for-deadly-fungal-infections-in-cannabis-growers-2000539391"&gt;bat guano as fertilizer&lt;/a&gt; to grow cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The Tennessee Department of Health is advising doctors to stay on alert for further cases and to suspect histoplasmosis when treating people from middle Tennessee with unexplained fever or respiratory illness.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Like the injection, the new Wegovy pill contains semaglutide, the same active ingredient as Ozempic. It works by mimicking a hormone in the body — glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) — that helps &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/how-does-the-brain-regulate-body-weight" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/how-does-the-brain-regulate-body-weight"&gt;&lt;u&gt;control appetite and blood sugar levels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="8316e336-e125-41f4-9f6b-810c671ad906-2"&gt;Both forms of Wegovy are approved to help adults with obesity — as well as adults who are overweight and have related health conditions, like high blood pressure — lose weight and keep it off, in combination with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. However, only the injectable version is approved for children 12 and up with obesity; the pill version is not yet cleared for that age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="56dfb11b-a920-44e6-b684-aac2c8e51a7c"&gt;Here's what to know about the new Wegovy pill and who might benefit most from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-32c8bc40-166d-4790-9e46-78730df8c567" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="do-semaglutide-pills-work-as-well-as-injections-3"&gt;Do semaglutide pills work as well as injections?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="c28f5363-e847-4603-9086-61b351d99219"&gt;The main difference between the Wegovy pill and the injection is how the drug enters the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When semaglutide is injected under the skin, it is absorbed directly into the blood. When taken as a pill, however, the drug must first pass through the stomach and intestines, where some of its active ingredient is broken down by digestive enzymes before it can be absorbed through the gut lining and into the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, "only a small fraction [of the pill] reaches the bloodstream," explained &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/20488/chika-anekwe" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/20488/chika-anekwe" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Chika Anekwe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, obesity medicine clinical director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Weight Center and an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School. This is an expected difference between injected and oral medications, in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qFZ8gTUHqxYuA2ppixrs2S" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qFZ8gTUHqxYuA2ppixrs2S slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the pill exposes the digestive tract to more semaglutide than the injection would, its local effects on the gut are minor, Anekwe explained. That's because the "key effects still require absorption and systemic signaling," so they only kick in once the drug reaches the bloodstream, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make up for that digestive process, the pill version of Wegovy is taken at a much higher dose than the injectable form. The highest dose of the pill is 25 milligrams, compared with 2.4 milligrams for the weekly injection, Anekwe told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pill also comes with strict instructions for when you should take it, Anekwe said. It should be taken on an empty stomach in the morning with a small amount of water, and patients must wait at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medications, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.novo-pi.com/wegovy.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.novo-pi.com/wegovy.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;its drug label says&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This ensures that the medication will be properly absorbed at the intended dose. The injectable version does not have these restrictions; it can be taken at any time of day and with no fasting required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1942738547/priya-jaisinghani" target="_blank" data-url="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1942738547/priya-jaisinghani" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Priya Jaisinghani&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an endocrinologist and obesity medicine specialist at NYU Langone Health, discussed the effectiveness of the two formulations during an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpxK_k0dklY" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpxK_k0dklY" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Endocrine Society webinar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about GLP-1 pills in December 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, "there has been no long-term, head-to-head trial" that has compared the once-daily 25-mg pill with the once-weekly 2.4-mg injection in adults with obesity, Jaisinghani said. However, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sciencehub.novonordisk.com/congresses/ow2025/plotkin.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://sciencehub.novonordisk.com/congresses/ow2025/plotkin.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;results from clinical trials that tested the drugs separately&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggest the two versions lead to very similar weight loss when taken as instructed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the STEP-1 trial, a study of 2.4-mg injectable semaglutide, participants lost an average of about 14.4% of their body weight. In the OASIS 4 trial, a study of the 25-mg pill, participants lost an average of about 13.9% of their body weight. Jaisinghani said these results indicate that the pill and the injection "offered comparable efficacy for weight management."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="8e1a6ab9-90fc-4de2-a49f-15f8ab0f9bbe"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;This is a 1.5-mg starter dose of the Wegovy pill.

These include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About three-quarters of Wegovy users experience mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal symptoms, Anekwe said. But for both forms of the drug, a minority of patients — around 7% to 10% — stop taking the medication because of these effects, according to trial data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Some real-world data suggest that a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2829779" target="_blank" data-url="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2829779" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;higher percentage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2819256" target="_blank" data-url="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2819256" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;of patients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stop taking GLP-1s within a year of starting them, but that may be due to a mix of factors, including both side effects and medication cost.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2359ea89-a27e-472c-88fd-be773fb75269" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-might-benefit-more-from-the-pill-or-the-injection-3"&gt;Who might benefit more from the pill or the injection?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="0fe998e4-be31-4b3d-9f38-4b8330634f1e"&gt;Patients considering Wegovy may opt for the pill or injection for different reasons. For instance, "the pill may be better for someone who is averse to using injections," Anekwe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pill version may also be more appealing to people who do not have reliable access to refrigeration, such as frequent travelers, she said. That's because the pill can be stored at room temperature, unlike the injection, which must be refrigerated. Generally, the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.novomedlink.com/obesity/products/treatments/wegovy/resources/for-pharmacists.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.novomedlink.com/obesity/products/treatments/wegovy/resources/for-pharmacists.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Wegovy injectables should be kept between 36 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2 to 8 degrees Celsius). And if needed, the pens can be stored at 46 to 86 F (8 to 30 C) for up to 28 days, if their caps haven't been removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="44ee8676-efdc-4039-aaf2-a8fc220a82bd"&gt;That said, the strict daily schedule of taking a pill on an empty stomach with restrictions on food timing may be challenging for some people to stick to. Those individuals may prefer the convenience of a once-weekly injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost and insurance coverage may also influence which version people choose. The pill may be better for someone who doesn't have insurance coverage because it has a lower out-of-pocket cost, Anekwe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And besides lifestyle factors and cost, there is another important difference that determines who can use each version: Unlike the injectable form of Wegovy, which is approved for adolescents ages 12 and older with obesity, the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.novo-pi.com/wegovy.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.novo-pi.com/wegovy.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Wegovy pill is currently approved only for adults&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="a3cc1fe7-ba58-4f8f-a0eb-168093acacf3"&gt;

But 16 days later, the now 30-year-old noticed she was experiencing unusual symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The former substance abuse counselor’s eyes were red and dry and her face and lips began to swell, she told Kennedy News &amp;amp; Media, via &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/37951078/mum-skin-horror-reaction-drug-face-melting-eyesight/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Sun;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Her symptoms eventually progressed to a painful rash on her torso and difficulty breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I wasn't sure what it was, I just knew something didn't feel right,” she explained. “The second day, my sister came to my house, and I was pretty incoherent. I was having a hard time breathing and was disoriented. That's when the rash started to spread across my face and left me with blisters. It was very painful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As McAllister’s condition worsened, she realized she needed medical attention and went to the hospital. There she quickly learned from doctors she was suffering from a skin disease called Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emily McAllister&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;SJS is a rare and serious skin disorder caused by an allergic reaction to medications, such as antibiotics or anti-seizure drugs, and sometimes infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Symptoms include a fever, sore mouth and throat, fatigue, burning eyes, red or purple rashes and blisters on the skin. As these erosions (painful open wounds that look like burns) develop, the top layer of affected skin dies and starts to shed, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17656-stevens-johnson-syndrome" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. The erosions typically spread to the eyes, chest, mouth, nose, throat, urinary tract, and genitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;SJS can also progress to its most severe form, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), where at least 30% of the skin is affected. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK574530/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, about 30% of people who develop TEN do not survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;McAllister was admitted to the hospital’s burn unit and over the next three years, she was hospitalized and fighting for her life. She lost 87% of her skin due to the blistering rash and underwent numerous surgeries including eyelid reconstruction, a stem cell transplant, a salivary gland transplant and three uterine surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;During that time, McAllister’s vision also deteriorated — a complication of SJS — resulting in her undergoing six eye surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emily McAllister in the hospital for SJS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-puzzler-8620185" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

Even after recovering from SJS, she said, much of the damage is permanent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Now I’m blind in both eyes. In the left eye, I don’t have any vision and in the right eye, I wear a special contact lens that helps a little bit but I’m still considered legally blind."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She says SJS is "so severe it lasts your whole life. My life is a lot different, I’m considered disabled now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, McAllister admitted that she tries to stay positive about her health journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I do feel lucky to be alive because SJS can be fatal,” she said. “I am lucky to continue to live life and be there while my daughter grows up.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/woman-loses-skin-goes-blind-from-rare-condition-sjs-11889920" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Singapore</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 18:13:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9paXY1ZXh0XzhiQWtDdnRvMWRuVUpZSU4yOUVENEpLX3JRV3hWeFptelVPel9RdjAtZ1ItdmdrdHBGeDd4NS1tWVVMbktLNkVfWkc3bWVIQ3VyRF9fWEt3dlI0Wmd4eWwyWVktOHBWVEw4UQ</guid></item><item><title>研究显示GLP-1停药后体重恢复较轻-正在寻找α</title><link>https://seekingalpha.com/news/4541668-study-sheds-light-weight-regain-glp-1-use</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sa-content-offsets"&gt;&lt;div class="paywall-full-content R6FbO mb-32 flex sa-text-content sa-media-content sa-table-content sa-content-helpers print:block"&gt;&lt;div class="w-0 grow print:w-auto"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="T2G6W JYDbo" data-test-id="content-container"&gt;&lt;figure class="getty-figure" contenteditable="false" data-show-to-all="false" data-type="getty-image"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/2244140593/image_2244140593.jpg?io=getty-c-w630" sizes="(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw -

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;This past week has brought a dizzying back-and-forth about a U.S.-funded medical research trial.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many public health experts call the study unethical and unnecessary, likening it to the infamous Tuskegee Experiment, while the Trump Administration has promoted it as a rare opportunity to study the potential negative effects of a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The randomized controlled trial — funded partly with $1.6 million from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — would study the general health effects of the hepatitis B vaccine given at birth in the west African country of Guinea-Bissau.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For a relatively small study in a relatively remote place, there has been outsized attention, and the rumor mill has been spinning. There have been contradictory reports that the trial has already started, that it has been canceled and that it's proceeding as planned.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;This morning at a press conference, the Minister of Public Health in Guinea-Bissau, Quinhin Nantote, finally weighed in, saying the study is suspended pending review.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We decided to suspend or even cancel the above mentioned study," said Nantote, who was speaking in Portuguese, through an interpreter. He said a local ethics committee that had approved the study did not have the "required technical resources" and did not coordinate with the necessary other medical authorities in the country. The country experienced a military coup in November last year and many high level officials changed in the process.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nantote said the ethics review was the "consequence of misinformation, weak social communication means and a lack of international communication, leading to inappropriate interpretations of our national health policies regarding immunization and health studies." He added that there has "been no sufficient coordination in order to take a final decision regarding that study."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Africa CDC, the health agency of the African Union, says it is sending a team to Guinea-Bissau to help the country evaluate the study. It says that local officials have the final authority.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's not a foreign country that will come and say this one will take place. It's the sovereignty of the country," says Dr. Jean Kaseya, director-general of Africa CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Immediately following the Thursday press conference, speaking on the condition of anonymity, an official with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sent an email to NPR that contradicted Nantote and Kasaya, asserting that the study has not been suspended.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here's a look at why this trial has garnered so much attention.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This study is happening as U.S. vaccine policy changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For more than 30 years, giving the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/12/04/nx-s1-5629168/hepatitis-b-vaccine-kids-health" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hepatitis B&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; vaccine to all newborns in the U.S. has been standard practice. It's also &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-b" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the recommendation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vaccine helps prevent infants from getting the hepatitis B virus from their mothers during delivery. The virus attacks the liver and can, years later, lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer and death. There's no known cure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, on December 5, CDC advisers &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/12/05/nx-s1-5634004/cdc-hepatitis-b-vaccine-acip-meeting" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;voted to overturn&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the U.S. policy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The advisers — hand-picked by vaccine-skeptic and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — worried the vaccine might cause some harm. However, outside medical groups point to numerous &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ebch.120" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; showing that it's safe and that rates of pediatric hepatitis B virus have &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/searchable-download/Universal%20Hepatitis%20B%20Vaccination%20at%20Birth%202Dec2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dropped by 99%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; since 1991 and the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2020surveillance/hepatitis-b/table-2.4.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that in 2020 only 10 children in the U.S. got hepatitis B from exposure at birth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Less than two weeks after the vote, a &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-23245.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;document emerged&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; detailing that the CDC would fund a study to look into the hepatitis B vaccine in Guinea-Bissau, where nearly one in five adults are infected with hepatitis B virus. That rate is much higher than elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa where the prevalence is just around 6%, according to the Africa CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The basics of the study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Guinea-Bissau does not currently give the hepatitis B vaccine to newborns per the WHO recommendation but plans to start doing so in 2028, according to Guinea-Bissau's Nantote.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Danish researchers say on &lt;a href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;their website&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that they want to study 14,500 newborns during this "unique window of opportunity" before the birth vaccination starts. Half of newborns will get the hepatitis B vaccine at birth, while the other half would get the inoculation later as part of other routine vaccinations given at 6, 10 and 14 weeks old.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The idea is not to test whether the hepatitis B vaccine works against hepatitis B. Instead, the researchers are looking for other health effects of the vaccine. Do the newborns who get the vaccine develop other severe illnesses in the first few weeks of life? Do they get eczema in the first two years of life? Or perhaps they show neurological differences before they turn 5?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ethics: unethical and unnecessary? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Not long after the study surfaced physicians and medical ethicists called for its cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"[The Guinea-Bissau study] is highly unethical and cruel and frankly dishonest," says &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Paul Offit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and formerly a member of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He's one of a number of physicians who have compared this study to the notorious &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/16/967011614/in-tuskegee-painful-history-shadows-efforts-to-vaccinate-african-americans" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tuskegee Experiment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which started in the 1930s and, for decades, denied treatment to poor African Americans with syphilis so that researchers could see how the disease progresses. More than 100 died as a result.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The 7,000 group that's not getting the vaccine till six weeks of age are now being exposed to substandard care — substandard care that is being paid for by American tax dollars," Offit says, noting that with such a high rate of hepatitis B virus in the population many of those youngers could be infected by their mothers before 6 weeks of age.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://med.emory.edu/departments/medicine/divisions/infectious-diseases/studies-programs/bircwh/scholars/boghuma-titanji.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Boghuma Titanji&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease physician at Emory University, agrees with the Tuskegee analogy and worries the study could be the "initial trigger that then leads to communities being distrustful of medical intervention and vaccines." She says that distrust can last decades and even be passed down from generation to generation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the study counter that, currently, newborns in Guinea-Bissau are not getting the vaccine at birth.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"No newborn in Guinea-Bissau will receive fewer vaccines because of this study," they wrote on &lt;a href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;their website&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, defending their study. They foresee that "vaccination coverage will increase" explaining "trial vaccination teams will operate every day of the year, including weekends and holidays. This is expected to increase timely vaccination coverage compared with routine services." The researcher did not respond to NPR's multiple requests for comment about the ethical questions and whether the study has been canceled.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some bioethicists say there's a more fundamental issue: "The first and important consideration in making a study ethical is: The study has to answer a valuable question," says Christine Grady, former chief of the Department of Bioethics at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. "In this case, I think that's perhaps the biggest problem with this study," she says, noting that the vaccine has long been known to be safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The researchers argue on their website that the results "will contribute to the global scientific understanding of how vaccination affects overall child health" and that "this is an important trial which can impact future vaccine policies in the region and worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The politics: Non-competitive, questionable researchers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another major point of contention: who is doing the research and how they were selected.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Danish researchers at the helm — including Dr. Christine Stabell Benn — are highly controversial. They are affiliated with the University of Southern Denmark and lead the Bandim Health Project, which has done research in Guinea-Bissau for decades.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While work by Stabell Benn's team has been published in reputable scientific journals, their statistical work has been questioned. For example, last month, in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X25012344" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vaccine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, outside biostatisticians evaluated the studies coming out of Bandim Health. What they found was that the group has "systematically over-interpreted the findings from their randomized trials," meaning the conclusions have been overstated and often aren't backed up by the data&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;when there was "proper statistical handling." That's according to a &lt;a href="https://health.au.dk/en/display/artikel/randomized-trials-show-no-evidence-of-non-specific-vaccine-effects" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;press release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; accompanying the article.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I was surprised by some quite strong claims," explains &lt;a href="https://www.au.dk/en/stovring@biomed.au.dk/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Henrik Støvring&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of pharmacometrics and statistics at Denmark's Aarhus University and lead author on the article. "But whenever I looked at a randomized trial — the primary outcomes I could find — it did not show statistical significance."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Stabell Benn's team has pushed back against this conclusion and requested the review be retracted by the journal. The request is being reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, RFK Jr. is a fan of Stabell Benn's team.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He cited a widely-criticized study on vaccine safety by Stabell Benn and others when he &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/07/01/g-s1-74752/rfk-jr-vaccines-safety-gavi" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pulled more than a billion dollars&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in U.S. funding for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. That money would have helped fund childhood vaccinations in many low-resources settings. The anti-vaccine organization RFK Jr. chaired — &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/03/nx-s1-5198506/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-chd-lawsuits" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Children's Health Defense&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — also &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/research_tags/diphtheria-tetanus-pertusis-dtp/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cites&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the Danish researchers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Outside vaccine experts have raised another concern: that the CDC awarded the $1.6 million dollars without an open, competitive process.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's led &lt;a href="https://medicine.usask.ca/profiles/bmi-affiliated/angela-rasmussen.php" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Angela Rasmussen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan, to worry that the Bandim Health Project was hand-picked by RFK Jr.'s team to do the research, since they are known to have raised safety concerns about vaccines long considered safe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"[The thing] people really need to know [is] behind this all — is cronyism, is bad science," she says. "It's babies getting chronic illnesses that can kill them."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a statement to NPR, the U.S. HHS defended the study and said it is proceeding as planned and the protocol is being finalized. Their statement said the study "represents the world's first and perhaps only opportunity to test the overall health effects of [the hepatitis B vaccine at birth]."&lt;/p&gt;

On the flip side, it is possible to take your H20 intake to the extreme and become overhydrated, especially if you fall into certain groups. There are signs you’re drinking too much water, though, that can help you recognize when it’s time to dial it back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/natasha-trentacosta-938538.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Natasha Trentacosta, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Natasha Trentacosta, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a sports medicine specialist and orthopedic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Orthopaedics in Los Angeles; &lt;a href="https://www.wmchealth.org/physician-locator/michael-klein-1508866757" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Michael Klein, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Michael Klein, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a kidney specialist with WMCHealth in Hawthorne, NY and an associate professor at New York Medical College.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overhydration is when there is an excess of water intake compared to water loss,” says &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/natasha-trentacosta-938538.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Natasha Trentacosta, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Natasha Trentacosta, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a sports medicine specialist and orthopedic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Orthopaedics in LA. Here, doctors explain the signs of overhydration you should know in order to modulate your water intake in a healthy way, plus who can become overhydrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Signs of overhydration to know&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mild water overload often is asymptomatic,” says &lt;a href="https://www.wmchealth.org/physician-locator/michael-klein-1508866757" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Michael Klein, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Michael Klein, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a kidney specialist with WMCHealth in Hawthorne, NY and an associate professor at New York Medical College. Still, there are some signs that may suggest an underlying issue with how your body is processing water (more on those below). According to the experts we spoke to, the most common signs include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who can become overhydrated?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average healthy person likely does not need to worry about overhydration. “Your body is very effective at adjusting,” says Dr. Klein. “Once you reach adequate water levels, your body just gets rid of the excess very efficiently, assuming a state of normal health.” This is also the reason you don’t immediately get sick from not drinking enough water, Dr. Klein adds, because your body can adjust to changes in your water intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there are certain groups of people who need to be careful not to overhydrate. The first is people with certain kidney diseases, especially those who produce excessive amounts of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is also known as vasopressin. “People who have an excess of ADH have strict water restrictions and water can be deadly. They have to be very careful,” says Dr. Klein. He explains that in these people (whose official diagnosis is &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000314.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion&lt;/a&gt;, or SIADH), ADH tells the body to hold onto water no matter how much you drink, which can lead to water intoxication if not accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar thing happens in people with liver disease and congestive heart failure, Dr. Klein says. “In &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a30872553/heart-failure-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart failure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;, your kidneys think you are dehydrated, and they will secrete these hormones, and if you drink water, you can get profoundly water toxic,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overhydration may also happen in athletes if they drink excessive amounts of water following strenuous exercise or activity, says Dr. Trentacosta. “This dilutes the sodium in their bodies and results in hyponatremia,” she adds. Per the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Fhyponatremia%2Fsymptoms-causes%2Fsyc-20373711&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa70049905%2Fcan-you-drink-too-much-water%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, hyponatremia is a condition in which sodium levels drop dangerously low. In addition to the groups of people mentioned above, it may also occur in those taking diuretics or antidepressants, people who have adrenal gland insufficiency or low thyroid hormone, or those who have chronic and severe vomiting or &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65833239/causes-of-diarrhea-to-know-about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diarrhea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diarrhea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, for most people, neither type will be an issue. “Normally, drinking large amounts of water, even up to six gallons, can be managed by the natural ability of our bodies to regulate water excretion through the combined efforts of the pituitary gland, kidneys, liver, and heart,” Dr. Trentacosta says. “But if any of these organs are dysfunctional, that upper limit can be lowered.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overhydration is rare, but it can occur—and in some cases, it may be caused by a serious issue that needs to be addressed. If you’re regularly experiencing any of the symptoms above, it’s definitely worth giving your physician a call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:30:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOLXpZOTdkSjlKVlFBVnYtTDQxYm93QmlOQ2FqeWc4QUpHMkc3VHhMdW9HbVRxQ2FmMlczbXcyOXFGbG90UkpydG1xQ0EwNlJRa0I1MFE0c3dUcHhNVC1MTDJaYkMwWDNmVGNTT0t0dFh2LUNEZ1BYMTBSS3hrRkpNTnhR</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心疫苗顾问对脊髓灰质炎疫苗接种的首要问题，其他长期建议- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/22/vaccine-policy-adviser-kirk-milhoan-individual-rights-trump-public-health/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chair of a federal vaccine advisory panel charted a new course for the committee in a podcast released Thursday — suggesting the public might want to reconsider the use of polio vaccines, arguing individual freedoms should be a north star of the panel, and pointing to the Covid pandemic as key to his thinking on health policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who became chair of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in December, also downplayed established science on vaccines during an interview for the podcast and suggested policy goals, not new research, were the driving force behind changing recommendations in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a wide-ranging interview with the podcast “&lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-should-i-trust-you/id1788335471?i=1000746190751" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Why Should I Trust You&lt;/a&gt;?”, Milhoan painted a more detailed picture of the committee’s strategy than has been previously known as it moves to weigh recommendations for vaccines given to children and pregnant people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked why the committee had revised existing recommendations, including delaying the age by which some children are immunized for hepatitis B, Milhoan said plainly: “Yeah, because we were concerned about mandates, and mandates have really harmed and increased hesitancy.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The current members of the ACIP were handpicked by health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after he dismissed its prior members last summer, accusing them of being influenced by the pharmaceutical industry. The new members, who include a number of Kennedy allies and vaccine critics, have since recommended removing thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative, from flu vaccines and splitting the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella combined shot with varicella taken separately. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group now intends to continue to review long-settled recommendations for pediatric vaccines and those given to expectant parents. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-should-i-trust-you/id1788335471?i=1000746190751" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;first interview Milhoan has given&lt;/a&gt; since a December ACIP meeting during which the hepatitis B recommendation was made and since he became chair. After the December meeting of the committee concluded, Milhoan was heard comparing the members of the panel to “puppets on a string.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was referring to what it’s like to be a committee member when there are lots of different pressures and threats coming in,” Milhoan said in the podcast, pushing back when asked if Kennedy or his agency was the “puppet master.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t had anyone say, ‘Kirk, this is what we want to make sure is voted on,’” he said. Milhoan did say, though, that he and other members of the committee have been subjected to threats, and that his son bought him bullet-proof clothing for Christmas. “You know, we have a whole email thread of all the threats we get as ACIPs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-public-health-versus-individual-rights-nbsp"&gt;Public health versus individual rights &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the interview, Milhoan clearly laid out what he sees as the goal of the new ACIP: protecting individual rights over public health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What we are doing is returning individual autonomy to the first order, not public health, but individual autonomy to the first order,” he said. Members of the panel have frequently questioned whether providers adequately inform patients of the risks and benefits of vaccines. At one point, Milhoan accused the American Academy of Pediatrics, which is suing the Department of Health and Human Services over its vaccine policies, of claiming their members don’t have time to adequately inform patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“[Patients] should be making the decisions on what the risks are of disease, what the risks are of vaccines, which is different for each person, what the family history is, and then make a decision from there, as opposed to what was sort of more of a heavy-handed, authoritarian thought of the vaccine schedule that led to mandates that if you didn’t have this set of vaccines exactly how they were prescribed, then you didn’t get in school,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asked about Milhoan’s remarks, an AAP official said they were “only the latest step in an effort to sow doubt and confusion” about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our answer is and has always been clear — talk to your doctor about the recommended vaccines for your child. Those decisions have always been made in partnership,” said Sean O’Leary, chair of the AAP’s committee on infectious diseases. “The answer isn’t biased government intervention, it’s trusted engagement between parents and doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the spectre of Covid-19 loomed large for Milhoan in the podcast: He frequently pointed back to messaging about the Covid vaccines, which he believes were made out to be more effective than they are. He also said that, as a pediatric cardiologist, vaccines weren’t front of mind for him until Covid-19 vaccine mandates. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People couldn’t go to school, and they couldn’t do this, and they couldn’t do this, to get a vaccine that has really been a large failure,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Milhoan also addressed what top appointees at the Food and Drug Administration have described as evidence that at least 10 children &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/29/covid-vaccine-deaths-fda-memo-vinay-prasad/"&gt;died from getting Covid vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, calling it “a very large death signal.”  Vaccine experts have called on the FDA to make the data public; to date it has not. Milhoan told the podcast hosts he had seen the data, but did not elaborate on them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Milhoan cast doubt on the scientific rigor of current public health decision-making. “I don’t like established science,” he said, adding “science is what I observe.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He pushed back on co-host Brinda Adhikari’s assertion that vaccines have been proven to reduce the spread of polio and measles viruses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m looking at the observable science,” he said. “And what I’m saying is that there is an emotion when people use the word proven.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He criticized previous iterations of the ACIP for not thoroughly considering the safety of vaccines — even though the committee has previously recommended pulling vaccines from the market because of safety concerns — and said the new committee is bringing an “increased level” of focus on safety. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet, he also said he had no new framework to evaluate vaccine safety, even as he criticized the CDC’s available vaccine safety reporting system. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t have a new solution. We’re working to figure out why it broke,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-questioning-polio-measles-vaccines"&gt;Questioning polio, measles vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asked about his thoughts on polio and measles vaccines, Milhoan seemed to question whether both are still necessary. There has been an international effort for nearly the past 40 years to eradicate the crippling polio virus, which still spreads in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and which occasionally makes its way out of that region. Measles, however, is running rampant in parts of the United States, with transmission occurring at rates that haven’t been seen since the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think also, as you look at polio, we need to not be afraid to consider that we are in a different time now than we were then. Our sanitation is different, our risk of disease is different, and so those all play into the evaluation of whether this is worthwhile of taking a risk for a vaccine or not,” Milhoan said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When … we talk about the risk of, let’s say, measles, many of those risks of not getting measles without having a vaccine was in the 1960s. We take care of children much differently now,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Milhoan’s suggestion that both better sanitation and less crowding could bring those diseases under better control than before the vaccines were introduced is a common talking point of Kennedy’s as well. One of Kennedy’s lawyers, Aaron Siri, prior to Kennedy’s confirmation, had petitioned the FDA to revoke approval for the polio vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Milhoan also seemed to suggest that the ongoing outbreaks will generate modern estimates of the risks measles poses. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What we’re going to have is a real-world experience of when unvaccinated people get measles,” he said. “What is the new incidence of hospitalization? What’s the incidence of death?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Milhoan said he didn’t want vaccination rates to decline — though many public health experts say health officials’ changes to vaccine policy &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/06/what-new-vaccine-schedule-means-doctors-parents-kids/"&gt;will do just that by introducing further uncertainty and confusion&lt;/a&gt; for families wondering whether to vaccinate their children. Earlier this month, the HHS recommended an entirely new childhood vaccine schedule, which slashed the number of recommended vaccines. ACIP was not consulted on the change but Milhoan said didn’t offend him. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t have a desire for less people to get vaccinated,” Milhoan said. “My desire is to have as low a side effect profile as we can that has the maximum efficacy in preventing disease or preventing horrible outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr. are having a chilling effect on vaccine makers as anti-vaccine rhetoric has turned into concrete changes to inoculation schedules and recommendations, investors and executives said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration of President ​Donald Trump has, in the last year, &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51428590/us-revises-childhood-vaccine-schedule-to-recommend-fewer-shots" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;upended vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, with the U.S. last month ending its longstanding guidance that all children receive inoculations against flu, hepatitis A and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51431259/doctors-say-changes-to-us-vaccine-recommendations-are-confusing-parents-could-harm-kids" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;The unprecedented changes&lt;/a&gt; have led to diminished vaccine usage, hurt the investment case for some biotechs and created a drag that will likely dent revenues and raise costs for companies in the ⁠coming years, 15 investors and analysts told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccines will not be a growth area under the current administration," said Stephen Farrelly, global pharma and healthcare lead at ING, signaling a potential drag on the sector through 2028.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine policy under Kennedy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist who has ‌cast doubt on the safety and efficacy of vaccines contrary to scientific evidence, has moved quickly since taking over the Department of Health and Human Services under Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He fired a panel of independent ⁠expert advisers, replacing them with members who share his anti-vaccine views, and dropped broad COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for pregnant women and children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also revived research into a long-ago debunked claim linking vaccines to autism, and adopted ‌new, reduced &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51433239/rsv-vaccination-push-made-a-huge-difference-for-utahs-kids-intermountain-health-says" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;childhood vaccine schedules&lt;/a&gt; without the long-standing ‍practice of involving a broad group of outside experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors and analysts initially saw Kennedy's appointment as a headline risk, rather than a fundamental threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, issues such ⁠as tariffs and drug-pricing pressure from the Trump administration were weighing on sentiment, putting vaccine concerns on the back burner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanofi Chief Financial ⁠Officer François-Xavier Roger last year noted "a little bit of negative buzz" around vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That changed as the risks became less theoretical. Investors are now concerned that the impact of Kennedy's policies will be hard to reverse, echoing public health experts' worries, who also said they will lead to preventable illnesses and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy says the changes aim to improve safety and bring U.S. vaccine policy in line with other peer nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A HHS spokesperson said in a statement that vaccine recommendations are based on the best available "gold-standard scientific evidence and public health considerations, not corporate interests."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big vaccine makers include UK-based GSK, France's Sanofi, U.S. drugmakers Pfizer and Merck, and smaller firms such as Moderna, Novavax and Germany's BioNTech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The striking policy changes have begun to prompt some rare public rebukes from industry leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla and Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson criticized Kennedy's rhetoric at a major healthcare conference last week, with Hudson citing "all the ... misinformation that is going around."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bourla told reporters it ‍was driving down vaccination rates and increasing disease risk. "I'm seriously frustrated," he said. "What is happening has zero scientific merit and is just serving an agenda which is political and antivax."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Political pressure starts to bite&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-term prospects for vaccine makers remain robust, investors said, as vaccines are still the most effective tool for preventing disease. But they said companies were now more beholden to the whims of political leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, success and failure will rest on the opinions of a few people. It's not enough to have good science and commercial opportunity," said Clear Street analyst Bill Maughan. "If you're a biotech investor, it just seems tough to really get conviction in a vaccine name right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors said they would stick by large-cap drugmakers less dependent on vaccine revenue, such as GSK, Sanofi, Pfizer and Merck. Smaller players like Moderna, BioNTech and Novavax face sharper risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect of U.S. changes is already starting to take hold. GSK and Sanofi reported lower U.S. flu vaccine sales in the third quarter, despite ‌a more severe flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Australia's CSL postponed separating its vaccine unit, Seqirus, citing "heightened volatility" and falling U.S. vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's clearly consumer reaction to the narrative that is coming out in the United States," said Jefferies analyst Michael Leuchten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Long-term view&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some investors said demand for vaccines and disease ‌prevention will likely rebound. Outbreaks such as the rising measles cases in South Carolina, or an extended severe flu season, could drive renewed vaccine usage, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently said the 2025–26 flu season had seen at least 11 million cases and 5,000 deaths reported so far, nearly double last year's toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, have challenged Kennedy's policies in court and it remains to be seen how that will play out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors "often focus on shorter-term time frames, while companies clearly take a far longer-term view," said Linden Thomson, senior portfolio manager at asset management firm Candriam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These businesses have been around for decades. They don't invest on a one- or ⁠two-year horizon," agreed Matthew Masucci, an analyst for Callodine ​Capital, which owns GSK and Sanofi shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for now, investors may be more cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whipsawing U.S. policy and vaccine skepticism are a drag on investment, said Ian Turnbull, an equity analyst at investment firm Mawer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It does make it a less attractive market to invest in if your demand isn't predictable like it used to be," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

Still, there are some signs that may suggest an underlying issue with how your body is processing water (more on those below). According to the experts we spoke to, the most common signs include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="8" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="8.0"&gt;       Gait instability or loss of coordination&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="8.1"&gt;       Increased falling &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="8.2"&gt;       Dizziness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="8.3"&gt;       Confusion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="8.4"&gt;       Lethargy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="8.5"&gt;       Nausea or vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="9" data-lazy-id="P0-17"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Who can become overhydrated?" data-anchor-id="who-can-become-overhydrated" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emt9r7s1"&gt;Who can become overhydrated?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The average healthy person likely does not need to worry about overhydration. “Your body is very effective at adjusting,” says Dr. Klein. “Once you reach adequate water levels, your body just gets rid of the excess very efficiently, assuming a state of normal health.” This is also the reason you don’t immediately get sick from not drinking enough water, Dr. Klein adds, because your body can adjust to changes in your water intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Still, there are certain groups of people who need to be careful not to overhydrate. The first is people with certain kidney diseases, especially those who produce excessive amounts of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is also known as vasopressin. “People who have an excess of ADH have strict water restrictions and water can be deadly. They have to be very careful,” says Dr. Klein. He explains that in these people (whose official diagnosis is &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000314.htm" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000314.htm" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion&lt;/a&gt;, or SIADH), ADH tells the body to hold onto water no matter how much you drink, which can lead to water intoxication if not accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;A similar thing happens in people with liver disease and congestive heart failure, Dr. Klein says. “In &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a30872553/heart-failure-symptoms/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a30872553/heart-failure-symptoms/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="heart failure" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;, your kidneys think you are dehydrated, and they will secrete these hormones, and if you drink water, you can get profoundly water toxic,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Overhydration may also happen in athletes if they drink excessive amounts of water following strenuous exercise or activity, says Dr. Trentacosta. “This dilutes the sodium in their bodies and results in hyponatremia,” she adds. Per the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hyponatremia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373711" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hyponatremia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373711" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mayo Clinic" data-vars-ga-product-id="38b40d87-967c-47da-a2ba-e66970440ecc" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link product-links css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, hyponatremia is a condition in which sodium levels drop dangerously low. In addition to the groups of people mentioned above, it may also occur in those taking diuretics or antidepressants, people who have adrenal gland insufficiency or low thyroid hormone, or those who have chronic and severe vomiting or &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65833239/causes-of-diarrhea-to-know-about/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65833239/causes-of-diarrhea-to-know-about/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="diarrhea" data-node-id="13.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;diarrhea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Still, for most people, neither type will be an issue. “Normally, drinking large amounts of water, even up to six gallons, can be managed by the natural ability of our bodies to regulate water excretion through the combined efforts of the pituitary gland, kidneys, liver, and heart,” Dr. Trentacosta says. “But if any of these organs are dysfunctional, that upper limit can be lowered.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Overhydration is rare, but it can occur—and in some cases, it may be caused by a serious issue that needs to be addressed. If you’re regularly experiencing any of the symptoms above, it’s definitely worth giving your physician a call. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 16:17:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9uXzFLTG5oaWtVUG9JclNSMXk3bE5jSlVGTGpVVUZscTBsQkJtMnF1SklSMWlGemJ1X1ZiRjFjYUxPSUhDdkNhQnAzWlJtS0Nyc0lFeVVHQlg5b2V5azFwd2RuWGp2RWdNWkhZZ2Z3VlpwZkRBYjRid25QbWFVQQ</guid></item><item><title>较少的年轻人死于癌症死亡的主要原因—结直肠癌除外- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/22/health/colon-cancer-young-adult-deaths</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Jenna Scott remembers the joy of being pregnant with her first and only child. She also remembers the immense abdominal pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000c3b6p9wfliiza@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During her pregnancy, she let her doctors know about the persistent discomfort. She was told it was normal, that the aches “came with the territory,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000d3b6p93749s0s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But after she delivered a healthy baby boy, the pain didn’t fade. It lingered.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000e3b6pr1vwl8ef@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than a year later, Scott received a diagnosis that shook her sense of normalcy: stage 4 colon cancer. She was 31 years old at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000f3b6pvd2kyr6x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We did a colonoscopy and when I woke up, there was my husband, my doctor and four nurses in the room. The GI doctor said he didn’t need to send anything off to pathology to know that I had cancer,” Scott, now 39, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000g3b6p79h5x5u1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Stage 4 cancer, also known as metastatic cancer, means the cancer has spread from its original location to other parts of the body. For Scott, she said the disease spread from her colon to her liver.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000h3b6p216u5dvh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’ve always been super fit and healthy. I’ve been an athlete all my life. I didn’t even grow up eating red meat. In an instant, my life changed completely and unexpectedly,” she said. “I was in a state of disbelief because that word ‘cancer’ didn’t live in my world. Cancer means death.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In a concerning trend, colorectal cancer now appears to be the deadliest cancer for young adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Colorectal cancer has surpassed other cancer types to become the leading cause of cancer deaths among people under 50 in the United States, as of 2023, according to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.25467?guestAccessKey=5eabd609-08b0-47c7-a738-916c7acdcc37&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=012226" target="_blank"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday in the medical journal JAMA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000k3b6pvpe8cg3c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Deaths from colon and rectal cancers in the under-50 age group rose by 1.1% annually since 2005, the research found. Because of this rise, colorectal cancer went from being the fifth most common cause of cancer deaths among people younger than 50 in the early 1990s to becoming the top cause in 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We don’t know why it is increasing,” said Dr. Ahmedin Jemal, senior vice president of surveillance, prevention and health services research at the American Cancer Society and senior author of the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Mortality for the other major causes of cancer deaths in young adults under 50 is declining. It is only colorectal cancer mortality that is increasing, but we really don’t know fully what contributes to this rising burden,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Scott, an advocate for the nonprofit Colorectal Cancer Alliance, also finds the new research troubling.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            After years of treatment – which included chemotherapy medications, targeted therapy and surgery – she is now in stable condition, but she said that she must “continue chemotherapy and targeted therapy indefinitely,” because each time she has stopped treatment before, the cancer came back and spread further to other organs in her body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            As she now continues treatment, Scott said that her goal is to “become a grandmother one day.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            For the new research, Jemal and his colleagues at the American Cancer society analyzed the annual numbers and rates of cancer deaths among people under 50 in the United States from 1990 through 2023, based on data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000s3b6pt4uqnuil@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s the most complete data we have,” Jemal said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000t3b6ptlfa8y3n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers examined the five leading causes of cancer death among the under-50 age group. They found that overall, from 1990 through 2023, more than 1.2 million people died of cancer in the United States before age 50, and the death rate fell by 44% during that time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The data also showed that deaths decreased for every leading cancer type, except for colorectal cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7000v3b6pk6hpvwnm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among the five leading causes of cancer death in people under 50, the average annual decline in deaths from 2014 through 2023 was 0.3% for brain cancer, 1.4% for breast cancer, 2.3% for leukemia and 5.7% for lung cancer, according to the data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There are nearly 60 new colorectal cancer cases diagnosed in people under 50 each day in the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://colorectalcancer.org/basics/facts-and-statistics#:~:text=Colorectal%20cancer%20is%20the%20fourth%20most%20common%20cancer%20in,among%20men%20and%20women%20combined.&amp;amp;text=Each%20year%2C%20about%20150%2C000%20Americans%20are%20diagnosed%20with%20colorectal%20cancer.&amp;amp;text=More%20than%2050%2C000%20people%20will%20die%20from%20colorectal%20cancer%20this%20year.&amp;amp;text=One%20in%2024%20people%20will,colorectal%20cancer%20in%20their%20lifetime." target="_blank"&gt;Colorectal Cancer Alliance&lt;/a&gt; — that’s a diagnosis about every 25 minutes.

            The new research is an important reminder for people under 50 to stay up-to-date on their cancer screenings, Jemal said. It’s recommended for people at average risk of colorectal cancer to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/colorectal-cancer/screening/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;start regular screening at age 45&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Yet “only 37% of adults ages 45 to 49 are up-to-date for their colorectal cancer screening,” Jemal said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Colorectal cancer screening can not only detect cancer at the early stage, but also it removes the polyps before it becomes cancer,” he said. “So, it’s one of the two screening types that we have that not only detects cancer at early stage but also prevents it, the other being cervical cancer screening.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The new research is “timely” and highlights a “red flag,” said Dr. Y.

            But while screening for colorectal cancer among healthy younger adults with no symptoms is critically important, “that’s only part of the story. I think there is a tremendous gap – and opportunity – in expeditiously diagnosing and treating people who are already symptomatic,” You said.

            “There is an unmeasurable group of young adults who have symptoms that may be consistent with colorectal cancer, but either sit on the symptoms because they are busy or are scared, or eventually access their health care system but encounter a provider who thinks it’s just a hemorrhoid and doesn’t trigger further investigations,” You said, referring to when patients’ symptoms sometimes get dismissed by their providers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr700193b6pcd4nn6xs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So, there are definitely delays in diagnosing young adults who are already symptomatic.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7001a3b6prjw4hwki@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When there are delays in diagnosing cancer, it becomes more likely that the disease will be diagnosed at later stages, such as stage 3 or 4. When cancer is at an advanced stage, it may have spread beyond the tumor itself into surrounding regions or other parts in the body, making it more difficult to treat and the patient becomes less likely to survive, regardless of age.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7001b3b6pi78l25ro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why the increase in colorectal cancer deaths appears to be happening at a time when more people under 50 are being diagnosed with advanced-stage disease, said Dr. Andrea Cercek, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who was not involved in the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7001c3b6phtx90on9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For colorectal cancer, “those under 45 are not screened, so they’re not diagnosed until they have symptoms. In many of those, about three-fourths, those symptoms are actually because they have much more advanced disease, and then the outcomes are worse, regardless of their age,” Cercek said, adding that the new research highlights a greater need to diagnose young patients quickly and not dismiss their symptoms because of age.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7001d3b6pbkgq7ook@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s estimated that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7423740/" target="_blank"&gt;more than 60%&lt;/a&gt; of colorectal cancer patients under 50 are diagnosed after the disease has already advanced to stage 3 or 4.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7001e3b6plwge7fkp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In this younger group, when we do see later stage of diagnosis, that is highly associated with lower survival,” said Christine Molmenti, an associate professor and cancer epidemiologist at Northwell Health in New York, who was not involved in the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkpfrgr7001f3b6plv77e88d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’ve met a lot of patients under 50 with this disease, and I think it is very heartbreaking,” she said. “Anecdotally, what we see a lot of times is that these patients are healthy. They’re fit. Sometimes they’re athletes. There were a couple of patients who had not survived the disease, but their parents told us that they ran a marathon four months before their stage 4 colon cancer diagnosis. And often times young people ignore symptoms, or their symptoms are dismissed. So, I think there needs to be awareness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far from being symbolic, the figures recorded in the codex were part of a dynamic and practical astronomical tool, according to new research led by &lt;em&gt;John Justeson&lt;/em&gt;, emeritus professor at the &lt;em&gt;University at Albany, SUNY&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Dresden Codex, one of only four surviving Maya manuscripts, includes folded pages with a meticulously organized sequence of lunar and eclipse calculations. The new analysis reframes it as a working scientific document, not just a religious or cultural artifact. The findings shed light on the scientific sophistication of Maya astronomers, who updated and corrected their data across generations to maintain predictive accuracy for ceremonial and practical use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research shows that the codex’s eclipse table wasn’t fixed. Instead, it was actively maintained and adapted, with precise reset mechanisms that allowed it to remain functional for long periods. The work changes how Maya science is understood, showing it to be both long-term and mathematically rigorous.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Precision Built on 405 Lunar Months and 69 Eclipse Markers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The eclipse table within the codex tracks 405 lunar months, with 69 lunations, the interval from one new moon to the next, marked as key points. Since solar &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/cracking-the-709-bc-eclipse/" data-type="post" data-id="97844"&gt;eclipses&lt;/a&gt; only occur during new moons near lunar nodes (the points where the Moon crosses Earth’s orbital plane), these marked lunations served as eclipse indicators.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/eclipse-table-of-the-dresden-codex-1200x727.jpg" alt="Eclipse Table Of The Dresden Codex" class="wp-image-104693" srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/eclipse-table-of-the-dresden-codex-scaled.jpg 1200w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/eclipse-table-of-the-dresden-codex-420x255.jpg 420w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/eclipse-table-of-the-dresden-codex-520x315.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eclipse table of the Dresden Codex – ©  Science Advances &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not all marked dates would have resulted in visible darkness, since eclipse paths can miss specific locations by hundreds of miles. Still, the Maya system functioned as a warning window, providing their calendar specialists, known as daykeepers, with a timeframe for potential eclipse activity rather than exact regional predictions. These daykeepers were responsible for maintaining the sacred day counts, integrating celestial events into ritual life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because each lunar month lasts approximately 29.5 days, a count based on whole days slowly drifted from the actual lunar cycle. Over time, this meant that predicted eclipse seasons could appear a day early or late, an error that observers would eventually notice. Such drift made it risky to rely on a single, unadjusted table.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Overlapping Reset Points Limited Cumulative Error&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, the Maya didn’t simply restart the count at the end of the table. Instead, they overlapped tables by beginning a new count before the previous one ended. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt9039" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new SUNY paper&lt;/a&gt;, two key reset points, after 358 months and 223 months, were used to keep the data aligned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/six-sheets-of-the-dresden-codex-pp-55-59-74-depicting-eclipses-multiplication-tables-and-the-flood-1200x727.jpg" alt=" Six Sheets Of The Dresden Codex (pp. 55 59, 74) Depicting Eclipses, Multiplication Tables And The Flood." class="wp-image-104696" srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/six-sheets-of-the-dresden-codex-pp-55-59-74-depicting-eclipses-multiplication-tables-and-the-flood-scaled.jpg 1200w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/six-sheets-of-the-dresden-codex-pp-55-59-74-depicting-eclipses-multiplication-tables-and-the-flood-420x255.jpg 420w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/six-sheets-of-the-dresden-codex-pp-55-59-74-depicting-eclipses-multiplication-tables-and-the-flood-520x315.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Six sheets of the Dresden Codex (pp. 55-59, 74) depicting eclipses, multiplication tables and the flood – © Wikimedia Commons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each reset served a different corrective purpose: one corrected small timing errors more frequently, and the other applied a larger adjustment after many repeated cycles. Modeling by the researchers showed that this combined strategy could hold the predictions within 51 minutes of accuracy over 134 years. The approach reveals a sophisticated understanding of long-term astronomical drift and suggests that these calendars were carefully managed and updated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Astronomy Rooted in Daily and Ritual Calendars&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maya astronomy was integrated into both sacred and civil life. Priests tracked sky events alongside the 260-day divinatory calendar and the 365-day civil year, making astronomy part of both daily and ceremonial planning. As &lt;a href="https://www.albany.edu/anthropology/faculty/john-justeson" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;John Justeson&lt;/a&gt; explained, the 405-month eclipse table appears to have been developed from a lunar calendar that was synchronized with the 260-day count, aligning sky events with ritual significance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Monthly moon observations likely came first, as eclipse prediction requires a consistent record of new moons. Justeson and co-author &lt;em&gt;Lowry&lt;/em&gt; propose that the eclipse table evolved from an earlier, less complex count of 405 consecutive lunar months. Over time, scribes repurposed the existing structure by adding eclipse markers, without needing to rewrite the entire document.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This adaptive reuse suggests that eclipse prediction emerged not from a sudden insight, but from a long tradition of lunar tracking and calendar maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Long-Term Use and Historical Alignment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most probable starting point for the surviving table falls around 1083 or 1116 CE, based on alignment with eclipse seasons in the northern Yucatán. A notable modern example, the total solar eclipse on July 11, 1991, which passed over Mexico and Central America, could have been flagged by the codex’s system when reset points were applied properly. Some later accounts incorrectly place this eclipse in 1999, but the 1991 event is the one that matches the documented path.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Evidence of earlier calendrical use by the Maya further supports this timeline. Fragments found at San Bartolo, dating between 300 and 200 BCE, show a day name (“7 Deer”) written in the style of the 260-day calendar. These marks were discovered within sealed layers of the Las Pinturas pyramid, confirming their historical context and demonstrating that Maya scribes had been maintaining ritual calendars for centuries before the codices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This narrowing of the airways, known as bronchoconstriction, is one of the main reasons people feel discomfort in extreme cold. He adds, “Cold air may also dry and irritate the airway lining, triggering inflammation and making the lungs more sensitive and reactive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;Another effect of cold temperatures is on the body’s defence mechanisms. “&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Cold air can impair the mucociliary clearance system, the tiny hairs in our airways that remove germs and particles, making you more prone to infections like bronchitis or pneumonia,” Dr Mangla explains.&lt;/span&gt; “Additionally, cold air thickens mucus, making it harder to clear, which can cause congestion and a persistent cough,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;For those exercising outdoors, there’s another risk. “Healthy individuals, especially runners or outdoor workers, may develop asthma-like symptoms in &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/bengaluru-cardiac-surgeon-explains-why-cold-weather-can-be-most-dangerous-for-your-heart-reveals-who-s-most-at-risk-101768829750392.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="cold weather"&gt;cold weather&lt;/a&gt;, known as exercise-induced bronchospasm,” says Dr Mangla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;“&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;People may experience a persistent or dry cough, chest tightness, breathlessness during exertion, wheezing after cold exposure, or an increased frequency of respiratory infections,” Dr Mangla explains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artContent"&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risks for people with asthma or COPD&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cold waves can be dangerous for people with asthma or &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/beyond-smoking-understanding-and-treating-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-101706361544978.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease"&gt;Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease&lt;/a&gt; (COPD), as cold air directly affects the airways and increases the body’s stress,” she warns. “In COPD, damaged lungs already struggle to exchange oxygen. Cold stress can make breathing harder and may lead to low blood oxygen levels. Extreme cold can also coincide with higher rates of influenza, pneumonia, and bronchitis, which can worsen symptoms and even lead to hospitalisation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who is more vulnerable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children and older adults&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smokers or ex-smokers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with allergies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Individuals exercising or working outdoors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those with recent &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/climate-shifts-fueling-viral-infections-doctor-explains-the-link-ashares-prevention-tips-for-children-and-elderly-101751712194229.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="viral infections"&gt;viral infections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prevention measures&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid strenuous outdoor activity in extreme cold.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover your nose and mouth with a scarf or mask&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay hydrated even during winter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warm up properly before exercising.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use prescribed inhalers regularly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep indoor air warm and humidified.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get vaccinated against flu and pneumonia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seek early treatment for a persistent cough or breathlessness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Consult a doctor if symptoms last more than 2–3 weeks, if there’s recurrent wheezing or breathlessness, chest pain, fever, blood in sputum, or if symptoms worsen with cold exposure,” Dr Mangla recommends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

&lt;p&gt;The public &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/health/"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; emergency warning has been made in the &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/san-francisco/"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; Bay Area and relates to a deadly &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/bacteria/"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; which has been reported in the area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Officials in Berkeley, &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/california/"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; say there has been a detection of leptospirosis – a potentially deadly bacterial disease which is transmitted by rats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was found in a homeless encampment in the area, leading to health officials setting out a warning to locals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The alert was issued by local health authorities and warned of the risks for dogs being walked, and residents.&lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p class="article-readmore__content-clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		


&lt;p&gt;Experts say recent rain has created favorable conditions for bacteria to thrive and be passed around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="outstream" class="nuk-ad-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Officials discovered strains of leptospirosis among multiple rats and say there have so far been at least two cases of dogs being infected after being walked near the Harrison Street encampment, located by Codornices Creek. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Dogs are particularly at risk because they tend not to avoid puddles of water in the same way that humans do,” Dr Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease physician at UCSF told &lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/berkeley-dangerous-bacterial-disease-21299405.php" rel="nofollow" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;SFGATE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She also explained it cannot be spread from human to human, so it is animals who are most at risk from the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Humans can however pick it up from contaminated puddles and soil. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leptospirosis is caused by leptospira bacteria, which is most commonly known to be spread through the urine of infected animals, mainly rats.&lt;/p&gt;

						LEPTOSPIROSIS is caused by leptospira bacteria, which is most commonly known to be spread through the urine of infected animals, mainly rats.					&lt;/p&gt;
				
				&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The urine then contaminates soil and stagnant water and can spread to other animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials say there have been no human cases reported as yet, and are warning people to be wary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disease poses significant dangers to both animals and people if contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
		


&lt;p&gt;The urine then contaminates soil and stagnant water and can spread to other animals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Officials say there have been no human cases reported as yet, and are warning people to be wary. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The disease poses significant dangers to both animals and people if contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The infections come primarily when contaminated water or soil comes into contact with cuts, eyes, the mouth, or mucous membranes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the city, the “combination of warm &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/weather-1/"&gt;weather&lt;/a&gt; followed by recent storms” has created “optimal conditions for the bacteria’s survival and transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bacteria can persist in soil or water for up to a month, increasing the risk of more infections long after the initial contamination.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;City officials have designated the Harrison Street area as a ‘red zone’ and advise people and &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/pets/"&gt;pets&lt;/a&gt; to stay at least a third of a mile away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A clean up operation is currently underway focussing on “water clean up, rat eradication, and public safety measures.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Environmental testing in the area is ongoing, and officials are calling on pet owners to vaccinate their animals against leptospirosis. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it is not just dogs at risk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Owners of cats who are allowed free reign are also encouraged to consider vaccination, while all pet owners should prevent animals from drinking potentially contaminated water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other rules have also come into force to protect dogs further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If caught leaving their &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/dogs/"&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt; outside in the harsh &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/winter/"&gt;winter&lt;/a&gt; weather, owners have been warned they could be hit with jail time and &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/15725493/january-pet-laws-pennsylvania-california-new-jersey/"&gt;fines up to $1,000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Certain parts of the &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/where/united-states/"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; are set to record some of their lowest temperatures for the winter so far over the &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/next/"&gt;next&lt;/a&gt; few days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Akron, &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/where/ohio/"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; is one such area set to experience single-digit temperatures dropping to double-digit negatives with wind chill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Likewise, pet owners are being reminded by local &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/police/"&gt;police&lt;/a&gt; to bring their animals inside or risk serious consequences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If found guilty of neglecting an animal, which can include leaving them outside in extremely cold temperatures such as those imminently coming, owners can be found guilty of a misdemeanor in the first degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthy teeth might be doing more than just brightening smiles. A growing body of research reveals that the number and condition of your &lt;strong&gt;teeth &lt;/strong&gt;could actually predict how long you live. And for older adults, even one missed dental visit could mean a significant shift in life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, dental care has been treated more like a cosmetic concern than a medical one. But a new wave of scientific studies is challenging that perception, showing that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;oral frailty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, tooth decay, and missing teeth are closely tied to higher risks of death, particularly among the elderly. In &lt;strong&gt;Japan&lt;/strong&gt;, where longevity is among the highest in the world, researchers have been digging into massive datasets to understand how dental health affects not just quality of life, but survival itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This shift in understanding has implications beyond public health policy. It affects how aging populations might approach preventive care, especially in countries like Japan, where the percentage of people aged &lt;strong&gt;65 &lt;/strong&gt;and over is rapidly rising. Far from being just a matter of cleanings and cavities, dental health may now be considered a vital part of longevity strategies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oral Frailty Linked to Shorter Healthy Lives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a six-year cohort study published in &lt;em&gt;Geriatrics &amp;amp; Gerontology&lt;/em&gt;, older adults in Japan with multiple signs of &lt;strong&gt;oral frailty&lt;/strong&gt; (including difficulty chewing, speaking, and dry mouth) had significantly shorter &lt;em&gt;healthy life expectancy&lt;/em&gt; (HLE). Men aged 65 with oral frailty had an HLE of just under 22 years, compared to over 23 years for those without it. The gap was even wider for women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (&lt;a href="https://www.jages.net/About-Jages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;JAGES&lt;/a&gt;) defined oral frailty based on the presence of at least &lt;strong&gt;three symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;: fewer than 20 teeth, chewing difficulty, swallowing issues, dry mouth, and speech problems. Their findings showed a clear trend, more symptoms equaled higher risk. In fully adjusted models, individuals with oral frailty were &lt;strong&gt;1.34 times&lt;/strong&gt; more likely to die during the study period than those without.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even pre-frailty (having one or two symptoms) was associated with shorter healthy lives. As explained in the study, transitions from a healthy state to disability or death were significantly more common among frail individuals, independent of other factors like income, education, or health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dental Visits Add Years to Life Expectancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the more surprising findings was the impact of &lt;strong&gt;routine dental care&lt;/strong&gt;. Among the more than 11,000 participants aged 65 and older, those who had visited a dentist in the previous six months lived longer and remained healthier, even when they already showed signs of oral frailty.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cumulative-probability-of-all-cause-mortality-by-tooth-condition-in-men-and-women-springernature-link-1200x727.jpg" alt="Cumulative Probability Of All Cause Mortality By Tooth Condition In Men And Women ©springernature Link" class="wp-image-104695" srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cumulative-probability-of-all-cause-mortality-by-tooth-condition-in-men-and-women-springernature-link-scaled.jpg 1200w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cumulative-probability-of-all-cause-mortality-by-tooth-condition-in-men-and-women-springernature-link-420x255.jpg 420w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cumulative-probability-of-all-cause-mortality-by-tooth-condition-in-men-and-women-springernature-link-520x315.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cumulative probability of all-cause mortality by tooth condition in men and women ©SpringerNature Link&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dental check-ups were linked to an increase of about one additional year of healthy life expectancy across all groups. According to the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ggi.70230" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Geriatrics &amp;amp; Gerontology&lt;/em&gt;, both men and women who saw a dentist regularly had better outcomes, regardless of how many oral frailty symptoms they showed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The benefits were especially noticeable for those in the most vulnerable group. Among people with full-blown oral frailty, the probability of death was higher for those who had skipped recent dental visits. The hazard ratio for death was &lt;strong&gt;1.25 &lt;/strong&gt;in individuals who hadn’t seen a dentist, compared to their peers who had.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filled Teeth Associated With Longer Survival&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;condition of the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/bronze-age-secrets-3500-year-old-teeth/" data-type="post" data-id="82941"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;teeth&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;also turned out to be more important than just the number. A large-scale Japanese study involving nearly 200,000 adults over 75 years old showed that having &lt;em&gt;filled&lt;/em&gt; teeth (those treated for decay) was linked to better survival outcomes than having decayed or missing teeth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to findings from the OHSAKA &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12903-025-07275-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, participants with 21 or more healthy or filled teeth had the lowest mortality risk. In contrast, men with no teeth had a 74% higher risk of death than those with at least 21 treated or sound teeth. For women, the increase was 69%. The data, published in &lt;em&gt;BMC Oral Health&lt;/em&gt;, highlighted that including decayed teeth in the count actually weakened the ability to predict mortality, suggesting that untreated decay carries ongoing health risks, likely through chronic inflammation or impaired nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers also emphasized that &lt;strong&gt;filled teeth&lt;/strong&gt;, unlike decayed ones, reflected access to dental treatment and care, a key factor in preventing long-term health decline. According to the study, the number of filled teeth was a more accurate predictor of all-cause mortality than the number of total remaining teeth, further underlining the importance of proactive dental care.&lt;/p&gt;

That variant is APOE-ε4. Another form of the same gene, APOE-ε2, has been associated with a lower likelihood of developing Alzheimer's and is widely believed to offer some level of protection against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large study published Jan. 16 in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;, The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, set out to examine how often these two gene variants appear in a rare group known as super agers. Super agers are people age 80 or older whose memory and thinking abilities closely resemble those of adults who are 20 or 30 years younger. The research was led by investigators at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower Frequency of Alzheimer's Risk Gene&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed a striking difference in genetic risk. Super agers were 68% less likely to carry APOE-ε4 when compared with individuals age 80 and older who had Alzheimer's dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What stood out even more was the comparison with cognitively healthy peers. Super agers were still 19% less likely to carry APOE-ε4 than other adults in the same age group who showed normal cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This was our most striking finding -- although all adults who reach the age of 80 without receiving a diagnosis of clinical dementia exhibit exceptional aging, our study suggests that the super-ager phenotype can be used to identify a particularly exceptional group of oldest-old adults with a reduced genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease," said Leslie Gaynor, PhD, assistant professor of Medicine in the Division of Geriatric Medicine. She led the study together with Alaina Durant, BS, a statistical genetic analyst in the Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer's Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher Levels of a Protective Gene Variant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers also discovered another important genetic distinction. For the first time, super agers were shown to have a higher frequency of APOE-ε2, the gene variant linked to reduced Alzheimer's risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with cognitively normal adults age 80 and older, super agers were 28% more likely to carry APOE-ε2. When compared with participants age 80 or older who had Alzheimer's dementia, super agers were 103% more likely to have this protective variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Largest Study of Super Agers to Date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This observational study included the largest number of super agers examined so far. The analysis drew on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project Phenotype Harmonization Consortium (ADSP-PHC), which is led by study co-author Timothy Hohman, PhD, professor of Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether, the study evaluated genetic and clinical data from 18,080 participants across eight national aging cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Super Agers Were Defined&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super ager status was partly determined by memory performance. Participants age 80 or older qualified if their memory scores were higher than the average score among cognitively normal adults ages 50 to 64.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study population included participants from several race and ethnicity groups. Among them were 1,412 non-Hispanic white super agers and 211 non-Hispanic Black super agers. The dataset also included 8,829 individuals with AD dementia and 7,628 cognitively normal controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, the APOE-ε4 variant is found in about 13.7% of people. Within this study population, the frequency was much higher at 43.9%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Super Agers Matter for Alzheimer's Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With interest in super agers growing," Gaynor said, "our findings notably encourage the view that the super-ager phenotype will prove useful in the continued search for mechanisms conferring resilience to AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is by far the largest study to date to identify differences in APOE-ε4 allele frequency based on super-ager status, and the first study to find a relationship between APOE-ε2 allele frequency and super-ager status. We would expect these findings to lend continued interest to questions of how these variants may influence development of clinical dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, as well as to the super-ager phenotype more generally."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Team and Funding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional contributors from Vanderbilt University Medical Center included Angela Jefferson, PhD, Logan Dumitrescu, MS, PhD, and Derek Archer, PhD. They worked alongside 32 researchers from 15 universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was supported in part by National Institutes of Health awards U24 AG074855, U01 AG068057, and R01 AG059716.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

There is no cure, making prevention key, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In the study, researchers analyzed data from large European populations across Copenhagen and the United Kingdom. Using analytical methods that mimic a randomized controlled trial, the researchers found that as BMI increased by approximately 4.5 points, the risk of vascular dementia rose across all BMIs, directly linking BMI to an increased risk of developing vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Additional analysis showed that elevated blood pressure, in association with BMI, directly contributed to increased risk of vascular dementia, adding to a growing body of evidence strongly linking cardiovascular health to brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"What is good for the heart is good for the brain," Frikke-Schmidt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;BMI is a measure of a person's body weight relative to their height.

Overweight and obesity are categorized as a BMI 25-29 and BMI 30 or greater, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Leah Croll, assistant professor of neurology at the SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, told ABC News many dementia cases may be preventable, and this new research adds to evidence showing how important targeting risk factors like elevated BMI and cardiovascular disease are to preserving brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Dementia prevention is the wave of the future," Croll said. Adding that it's important to reinforce or develop habits to maintain a healthy weight and manage blood pressure through diet, exercise, and routine medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;While some people may be more motivated to lose weight, Croll said that blood pressure is a silent symptom that can be easier to ignore or may often go unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"A paper like this really allows me to have conversations with my patients in the clinic where I can motivate them to stay on top of their blood pressure," Croll said.

"You can get vitamin D from most pharmacies and retailers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As we say, however, many medics have recently argued that this shouldn't be a blanket rule, claiming some patients have reported experiencing four indicators that the supplements are having adverse effects on their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Switching up your dosage might be advised (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Biomedical scientist Tobias Mapulanga explained: "As the NHS encourages vitamin D in winter, many people are reaching for bottles in the darker months and accidentally overshooting, then blaming the fallout on seasonal bugs, when constant thirst and needing the loo more often, queasiness, tummy pain or constipation, headaches or brain fog, and new aches or cramps appear soon after increasing your intake or adding sprays or gummies, that points to a supplement backfiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The stakes are clear: the right amount supports you, but doubling up can turn a well-meant routine into feeling worse rather than better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Constantly needing a wee, but still feeling thirsty&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;If you find some weeks after starting to take Vitamin D supplements that you're needing to urinate more often, and constantly feel thirsty, it could be an indictor that you're taking too much then you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This is because Vitamin D has the potential to disrupt both fluid and salt balance, which came leave a person both parched, but needing the loo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It is recommended in these cases, to take absolutely no more than the prescribed 10mg, and to always keep water close by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Vitamin D can cause extreme thirst (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Feeling nauseous&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Enduring general sickness, burping more than you usually would, or suffering from a sour stomach could also be a sign that something is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This could be because some variations of Vitamin D could contain sweeteners or flavourings that throw off a person's stomach acid levels, and trigger irritation. It's recommended in these cases to either take your supplement with a main meal, and switch from taking sprays of gummies to tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Achy bones and muscles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;If you notice you're cramping more often, or just feeling generally much more fatigued that usual, it could be a sign that Vitamin D supplements aren't for you. An excessive amount of this nutrient can upset the minerals that your muscles rely on, and this, mixed with potential dehydration, could cause muscles to cramp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It's recommended to adjust your amount in these cases, as well as to drink a large glass of water with meals, and add things like yoghurt, leafy greens, beans and bananas into your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Too much Vitamin D can cause aches and pains (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Struggling to focus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Has your brain felt foggier than usual since you started taking Vitamin D supplements? If so, again, it could indicate you've taken too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;High doses of this specific nutrient can cause a person's calcium levels to surge, with additives like sweeteners also having the potential to muddle their thinking. In these cases, it is recommended that a person takes their pill with food, or to choose a product listing only cholecalciferol as a bulking agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>tyla.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 14:03:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPYjNlUUpOZVBCMXRJR01kQm9FWXpubGs0MzBWbVd6a2MwaWhWNnB0ZF9oTlBIU3I1QW1EUTZXMG5Mcjk3eTdwUFMxcXB5T2hJbVhteTktTmNiRVplN2VyQ1BaRHhveTAwd25sa0RDSTRLWUdxeE9ILS1uVTNlQ216Y2FB</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，推动睾丸激素测试的“Manosphere”影响者正在说服健康的年轻人，他们有问题-卫报</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/22/manosphere-influencers-testosterone-tests-young-men</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If you’re not waking up in the morning with a boner, there’s a large possibility that you have low testosterone levels,” an influencer on TikTok with more than 100,000 followers warns his viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Despite screening for low testosterone being medically unwarranted in most young men, this group is being aggressively targeted online by influencers and wellness companies promoting hormone tests and treatments as essential to being a “real man”, a study published in the journal Social Science and Medicine has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers analysed 46 high-impact posts about low testosterone and testing made by TikTok and Instagram accounts with a combined following of more than 6.8 million, to examine how masculinity and men’s health are being depicted and monetised online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4dde43ac-b3ef-42bb-bb66-44fb1419ccf8" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Social media misinformation driving men to seek unneeded NHS testosterone therapy, doctors say","elementId":"4dde43ac-b3ef-42bb-bb66-44fb1419ccf8","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/08/social-media-misinformation-driving-men-to-nhs-clinics-in-search-of-testosterone-they-dont-need"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The lead author of the study, Emma Grundtvig Gram, a public health researcher at the University of Copenhagen, said influencers promoting routine testosterone screening often framed normal variations in energy, mood, libido or ageing “as signs of pathology”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This meant “men may come to perceive themselves as inherently deficient or in need of medical intervention”, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This creates a sense of urgency for solutions, which in turn fuels lucrative markets for pharmaceuticals, supplements and medical devices, even in the absence of clear clinical benefit. More broadly, this contributes to the medicalisation of masculinity itself. It reinforces a narrow, idealised model of masculinity, while marginalising non-traditional or diverse expressions of gender.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Testosterone naturally declines with age but it is not inevitable for all men, and lower levels may also be linked to factors including type 2 diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome and the use of certain medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Gram and her colleagues found the posts often targeted younger, fit men and contained messaging aligned with the “manosphere” – online communities that circulate ideas about male superiority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Within this narrative, so-called ‘alpha men’ are promoted as dominant, sexually successful and physically powerful, and our study found testosterone was positioned as the key to achieving this status,” Gram said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This connection is important because it shows that testosterone marketing is not just about health, but is embedded in wider cultural and ideological narratives about gender and power, and the manosphere is not simply an ideology, but also an industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Ada Cheung, an endocrinologist in the University of Melbourne’s department of medicine who was not involved in the study, said routine screening for low testosterone in asymptomatic men, including younger men, was not supported by Australian guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Generally, testing is recommended only when symptoms such as delayed puberty or reduced libido are present, or in specific clinical circumstances, such as after testicular surgery or chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Symptoms commonly attributed to low testosterone were often non-specific and overlapped with fatigue, stress, anxiety, depression and relationship difficulties, Cheung said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This often leads to discussions about the normal range of testosterone, the limited evidence for benefit in otherwise healthy men, and the potential risks of unnecessary treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s not hard to get testosterone on the black market or on the internet or in gyms, so many who want to try it may not seek out medical advice necessarily. Risks of unwarranted testosterone testing or treatment include masking of underlying conditions, and unnecessary exposure to side-effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These can include infertility, cardiovascular risk and thickened blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="523d0149-d6b2-465b-a07a-8f7627ec2df8" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":17,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Looking for Mr T: the politicisation of testosterone","elementId":"523d0149-d6b2-465b-a07a-8f7627ec2df8","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/jul/28/looking-for-mr-t-the-politicisation-of-testosterone-and-toxic-masuclinity"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Gram’s study found 72% of social media posts analysed also had financial interests, such as selling testosterone tests, treatments or supplements, or were sponsored by industry.

It worked. After her treatment last summer, she was sober enough to visit her son for the first time in six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“I’ve tried to do it myself over and over again, and nothing ever works,” Jordan said of kicking her addiction. “Nobody would have ever thought I would’ve gotten clean.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Where Narcan has proved to be a last-ditch lifesaver for overdoses, the treatment Jordan received is spurring hope among physicians and addiction treatment specialists in San Francisco for longer-term freedom from fentanyl. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;The long-acting injectable buprenorphine acts as an “opioid blockade,” binding with receptors in the brain and desensitizing the patient to the narcotic effects of fentanyl for up to a month at a time. Until recently, fentanyl users hoping to kick the habit have had to take a daily pill of the withdrawal medication, which causes complications for those living on the streets. The longer-acting version of buprenorphine gives doctors a higher probability of following up with patients before fentanyl cravings return. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;However, the medication can lead to temporary withdrawal symptoms that are so intense that some patients decide to forgo further treatment. The first injection — the effects of which last roughly a week — carries the risk of sending the patient into sudden and violent withdrawal if the amount of fentanyl in their body isn’t accurately calculated. That’s a difficult task for doctors administering the medication, as users are often unsure exactly how much opioid they’ve taken. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;But in spite of these drawbacks, public health experts and addiction specialists believe the injections to be one of the most promising therapeutics in the fight against the fentanyl epidemic. Though they have declined from an all-time high in 2023, annual overdose deaths in San Francisco have plateaued at more than 600.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;In other states and cities, the use of long-acting buprenorphine is still emerging or under study. But San Francisco has been an early adopter. In Jan. 2024, the city’s Department of Public Health first began trialing the long-acting injections just a few months after one of the medications received approval from the Food and Drug Administration. That year, DPH administered more than 1,400 injections across the city. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;In 2025, DPH use of the drugs doubled, to more than 2,800 injections, giving hundreds of people who were imprisoned by their addiction a chance at recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;This month, DPH expanded use of the medications to jails, where incarcerated people&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;can receive their first dose within eight hours of their arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“It’s a very empowering way for people to be on medication and not have to think about the daily planning, the daily routine, keeping track of their medications,” said DPH physician Dr. Jeffrey Hom. “It allows them to focus on other aspects of their lives that they may not have been able to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading-block article-body text-left"&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;As overdose deaths have mounted, effective long-term treatments for opioid addiction have proved elusive. Fentanyl vaccines have been in development for years, with at least &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/a-fentanyl-vaccine-is-about-to-get-its-first-major-test/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;one entering early trials&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt; (opens in new tab)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, but FDA approval is years away. In the meantime, use of injectable forms of buprenorphine, sold under the brands Sublocade and Brixadi, is growing worldwide. Once the extended-release formulation is injected, the drug is released gradually over several days or weeks, eliminating the ups and downs of taking a daily pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;However, their promise comes with a catch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;If doctors administer the wrong amount of the drug, patients can experience an acute dayslong illness. The hot flashes, cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea can leave people bedridden and in misery. Even if they’re temporarily unable to feel the effects of fentanyl, they’re so sick that they may no longer trust the treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“It’s kind of like you’re driving a car at 100 mph, and you slam on the brakes to get to 50 mph,” explained Dr. Christine Soran, deputy medical director of substance use services at the DPH. “That sudden change is really uncomfortable.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfstandard.com/2025/12/22/sf-homeless-drugs-coordinated-entry-purgatory/" data-post-id="06aa6727-ca1a-43b3-9553-6035b7a0ed47"&gt;Rudy Batka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; had been addicted to fentanyl for five years and living on the streets of San Francisco when he received his first injection of Brixadi. The medication made him so sick that he left a sobering center in SoMa and chose not to continue treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;A week later, a doctor at a drop-in clinic assured Batka he was in the “perfect window” to receive the second dose, which would have made him essentially&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;immune to the narcotic effect of fentanyl&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;for another month. The doctor assured him it wouldn’t make him sick again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="ImageBlock_ImageFigure__ZnquR grid-wide inset-image mobile-grid-full mobile-grid-full" data-align="wide"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="basis-full mt-[10px] text-xs text-gray-550 font-inter leading-[18px] "&gt;Dr. Noelle Martinez holds Rudy Batka’s hands in an effort to keep him awake during a visit to the Behavioral Health Access Center.&lt;span class="image-caption-divider"&gt; | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Source: &lt;/span&gt;Amanda Andrade-Rhoades/The Standard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;But Batka was too scared to consent. Instead, he returned to the streets, where he soon relapsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Experts say they recognize the difficulty of administering the first dose of the drug. Even so, early studies have shown that the long-acting injectables have a higher retention rate than comparable daily medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;A study in July found that 43% of patients in jail who received their first injection attended a follow-up appointment after their release. Comparatively, the average follow-up rate for patients who used the daily pill version of buprenorphine while in custody was 29%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;The injections offer more freedom for patients than daily medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“They can leave San Francisco and don’t have to think, ‘Oh my gosh, am I going to run out [of pills]?’” Hom said. “They can travel, they can see family. … Those are the sort of moments where I really realized that this can be very empowering.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>sfstandard.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBTdjg1djFMSEJzSGxfY3N2UVdrQ3RuMmp5T3BsQ0hZS0p4d1pNcURNaFZSSVdsUjd5TnlKb1ZkT3NTQ1RiLXlOT01nZXN1WTU2aXRuZ1JJWEdOak81b1NZbzJQWUdoN0RjR1dKaGRRaFktZmpYbkFqVzFmbGZpYmc</guid></item><item><title>纽约州立大学北部分校寻求一小群志愿者进行针对常见致命感染的疫苗研究- syracuse.com</title><link>https://www.syracuse.com/health/2026/01/suny-upstate-seeks-small-army-of-volunteers-for-vaccine-study-against-common-deadly-infection.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UXJBRTUK5NGC7JRZ7MAORPSKAQ"&gt;Syracuse, NY -- Upstate Medical University is looking for 1,000 volunteers -- &lt;a href="https://www.upstate.edu/news/articles/2026/2026-01-15-cdiff.php" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.upstate.edu/news/articles/2026/2026-01-15-cdiff.php"&gt;its largest clinical trial to date&lt;/a&gt; -- to test a vaccine against a deadly infection that primarily afflicts people in healthcare settings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WKRUDOCOKZHBJPWKMAKLM32UVY"&gt;The effort, led by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, is aimed at preventing bacterial infections caused by Clostridioides difficile, commonly known as c. diff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="U5KG2WNHQJF4NNR2CQ56MEEAAI"&gt;C. diff is most common in people who have recently had antibiotics in a hospital, nursing home or other health facility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="H2VRFKASVRDX7KTC6SZ72L34DU"&gt;It causes typically causes diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever.

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the widely known biological clock in women, male reproductive aging has often been overlooked. Public and medical narratives have long portrayed sperm quality as relatively unaffected by age, with men sometimes fathering children into their seventies or eighties. Yet growing evidence suggests otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Children of older fathers have higher statistical chances of neurodevelopmental disorders, metabolic issues, and even stillbirth. This has prompted several fertility societies, including the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, to recommend an upper limit of 40 years for sperm donation. Until now, however, the biological mechanisms behind these risks have remained largely unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers from the University of Utah and the University of Nevada have uncovered a potential molecular explanation, published in &lt;em&gt;The EMBO Journal&lt;/em&gt;. Their findings point to a sudden and dramatic transformation in sperm RNA profiles, an internal biological signal that could serve as a marker for aging sperm and its effects on the embryo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Invisible Layer of Sperm Biology&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery began with a reexamination of sperm composition. For years, scientists focused almost exclusively on the DNA within sperm heads. It was known that sperm DNA becomes fragmented with age, but sperm also carry RNA, molecules that help execute genetic instructions. According to the research team, standard sequencing tools failed to detect many of these RNAs because they are chemically modified and thus invisible to conventional methods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To overcome this, the scientists developed PANDORA-seq, a new technique that strips away chemical disguises from RNA, revealing previously undetectable fragments. When applied to sperm from mice, the researchers uncovered a massive population of small non-coding RNAs, including transfer RNA-derived (tsRNAs) and ribosomal RNA-derived fragments (rsRNAs). These elements are not just cellular debris. As explained in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s44318-025-00687-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt;, they act as regulators during early embryo development, influencing gene expression at a critical stage.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/discovery-of-an-aging-cliff-in-mouse-sperm-sncrna-profiles-using-pandora-seq-1200x727.jpg" alt="Discovery Of An ‘aging Cliff’ In Mouse Sperm Sncrna Profiles Using Pandora Seq" class="wp-image-104683" srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/discovery-of-an-aging-cliff-in-mouse-sperm-sncrna-profiles-using-pandora-seq-scaled.jpg 1200w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/discovery-of-an-aging-cliff-in-mouse-sperm-sncrna-profiles-using-pandora-seq-420x255.jpg 420w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/discovery-of-an-aging-cliff-in-mouse-sperm-sncrna-profiles-using-pandora-seq-520x315.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discovery of an ‘aging cliff’ in mouse sperm sncRNA profiles using PANDORA-seq – © The EMBO Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What surprised the team was not just the presence of these RNAs, but the sudden change in their profile. Between 50 and 70 weeks of age in mice, equivalent to mid-life in humans, the RNA profile of sperm shifted sharply. It wasn’t a gradual decline, but a dramatic drop, described by lead author Qi Chen as an “a&lt;em&gt;ging cliff.&lt;/em&gt;” The study found a parallel in human &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/sperm-whales-communication-unique-humans/" data-type="post" data-id="95098"&gt;sperm &lt;/a&gt;samples collected from the same donors years apart: the same lengthening of rsRNAs occurred in both species.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Reverse Clock Inside Sperm Cells&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Conventional wisdom suggests that aging leads to shorter, degraded molecular structures. But this study revealed the opposite. According to the authors, specific ribosomal RNAs in sperm heads actually become longer with age, not shorter. The balance shifts: more long fragments, fewer short ones. This inversion puzzled researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of indicating decay, the elongated RNAs may signal a breakdown in the sperm’s molecular processing system. The study suggests that oxidative stress may be damaging the enzymes responsible for trimming these RNAs to their functional lengths. As these enzymes lose efficiency, longer RNAs accumulate. This transformation could rewrite the genetic script that sperm deliver to the egg.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/discovery-of-an-aging-cliff-in-mouse-sperm-sncrna-profiles-using-pandora-seq-1-1200x727.jpg" alt="Discovery Of An ‘aging Cliff’ In Mouse Sperm Sncrna Profiles Using Pandora Seq" class="wp-image-104684" srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/discovery-of-an-aging-cliff-in-mouse-sperm-sncrna-profiles-using-pandora-seq-1-scaled.jpg 1200w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/discovery-of-an-aging-cliff-in-mouse-sperm-sncrna-profiles-using-pandora-seq-1-420x255.jpg 420w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/discovery-of-an-aging-cliff-in-mouse-sperm-sncrna-profiles-using-pandora-seq-1-520x315.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conserved age-related length shift of rsRNAs in human sperm cohorts – © The EMBO Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found this change was localized. Only by isolating sperm heads, separating them from their tails, which contain high concentrations of mitochondrial RNA, ould the signal be clearly detected. As noted by Tong Zhou, a co-corresponding author of the paper, previous sequencing of whole sperm likely masked the shift, as tail RNA overwhelmed the signal from the head. The sperm head, which fuses with the egg and carries the key genetic material, holds the altered rsRNAs, making this discovery all the more significant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Old RNAs, New Consequences for Embryos&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test whether these RNA changes have functional consequences, the team created a synthetic RNA cocktail. This blend mimicked the profile of sperm from older males, rich in long rsRNAs and poor in short ones. When injected into mouse embryonic stem cells, the cocktail triggered major shifts in gene activity. Specifically, it activated pathways tied to metabolism and switched on genes linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results echo previous epidemiological data that link advanced paternal age to increased risks of developmental and metabolic disorders in children. According to &lt;a href="https://attheu.utah.edu/facultystaff/scientists-discover-a-hidden-rna-aging-clock-in-human-sperm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the University of Utah researchers&lt;/a&gt;, this RNA-based mechanism could be a “&lt;em&gt;molecular smoking gun&lt;/em&gt;” explaining those associations. The altered RNA signals alone, without any changes to DNA, were enough to reprogram the cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While current male fertility tests focus on sperm count, motility, and shape, this research suggests that RNA content may carry critical, overlooked information. James M. Hotaling, one of the study authors, pointed out that these findings could lead to future diagnostic tools to assess “&lt;em&gt;sperm RNA age&lt;/em&gt;” and refine reproductive counseling for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10909733/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;older fathers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aging has traditionally been viewed as a gradual and continuous process shaped by time, genetics, and environment. However, advances in molecular biology are challenging this assumption, revealing that physiological aging may proceed unevenly across the lifespan rather than at a constant pace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A multi-omics study has identified &lt;strong&gt;two distinct age ranges&lt;/strong&gt;. These inflection points suggest that aging is driven not only by accumulation, but also by disruption, with implications for how biological age is measured and how disease risk, screening strategies, and preventive interventions are approached in mid- to late adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Evidence Points to Critical Biological Turning Points&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A team at &lt;em&gt;Stanford School of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; tracked over 135,000 biological markers in 108 individuals over several years. The study, led by Dr. Michael Snyder, chair of genetics, found that &lt;strong&gt;81 percent of molecules associated with aging changed in non-linear patterns&lt;/strong&gt;. Rather than progressing steadily, molecular activity underwent rapid shifts at two defined ages: &lt;strong&gt;44 and 60&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00692-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the research focused on multi-omic datasets, including &lt;strong&gt;metabolomic, proteomic, and microbiome&lt;/strong&gt; data. It revealed significant changes in cardiovascular, immune, and metabolic functions during the identified age ranges. These included fluctuations in lipid metabolism, alcohol and caffeine processing, and markers tied to cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biological samples were collected at regular intervals, enabling time-sensitive insights. Participants in their 40s exhibited measurable shifts in pathways associated with &lt;strong&gt;muscle maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2026/01/sunburn-cause-finally-discovered-rna-damage-not-dna/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="117958" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stress response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and organ function. Those in their early 60s showed altered indicators of immune system regulation, kidney filtration, and chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Xiaotao Shen, a co-author, noted a high density of molecular transitions clustered around the two age markers. These did not appear in adjacent age ranges, suggesting discrete periods of elevated biological volatility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Microbiome as a Core Driver&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study placed particular emphasis on the &lt;strong&gt;human microbiome&lt;/strong&gt;, a dense microbial ecosystem primarily located in the gastrointestinal tract. Shifts in microbiome composition were strongly associated with both age thresholds. These changes are linked to key physiological processes, including nutrient absorption, immune signaling, and neurochemical production.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers observed that microbial diversity and abundance changed in parallel with systemic molecular markers. This co-variation reinforces existing research suggesting the microbiome plays a role in modulating the biological aging process. Disruptions in microbial equilibrium have previously been associated with cognitive decline, inflammatory disorders, and metabolic disease.&lt;/p&gt;

Four types of biological samples were collected, and 10 types of omics data were acquired. Credit: Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Although the study did not directly identify causality, the concurrent shifts across molecular systems and microbial ecosystems suggest a high degree of interdependence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Behavior and Biology Intersect in Midlife&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research also addressed the possibility that lifestyle patterns may coincide with or trigger biological inflection points. Dr. Snyder highlighted midlife behavioral trends such as increased alcohol intake and sustained stress as potential contributors to metabolic disruptions. “Alcohol metabolism may falter due to increased consumption that often occurs in midlife,” he said in an earlier interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While these hypotheses remain under investigation, prior studies have linked long-term stress and poor sleep quality to deteriorating cardiovascular and immune function. The data from the Stanford study align temporally with &lt;strong&gt;life-stage transitions&lt;/strong&gt;, such as peak occupational pressure and shifts in family responsibilities, which may carry physiological consequences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The concept of &lt;strong&gt;allostatic load&lt;/strong&gt;, referring to cumulative biological wear and tear from chronic stress, provides a theoretical framework for understanding how psychosocial factors might influence the timing of biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Limited Scope, High Resolution&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite its depth, the study presents several limitations. The sample size of 108 individuals restricts statistical generalizability, and the cohort was not demographically representative. Broader replication will require expanded datasets with greater ethnic, geographic, and socioeconomic diversity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data are observational, not interventional; as such, causality cannot be inferred. While the research identifies correlations between molecular changes and age, it does not establish whether these changes are driven by internal biological clocks, external environmental triggers, or their interaction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data collection also required &lt;strong&gt;frequent biospecimen analysis&lt;/strong&gt;, which may not be feasible in large-scale clinical environments. This logistical burden highlights a tension between the precision of the findings and their scalability for public health interventions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cost remains another barrier. Multi-omic data generation and high-resolution longitudinal tracking are resource-intensive, limiting accessibility to elite research institutions with long-term funding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Rethinking Health Strategies for the 40s and 60s&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If validated through further studies, these findings could influence clinical screening guidelines and reshape how midlife health risk is assessed. Current models often rely on chronological age as a proxy for physiological risk. The Stanford research proposes an alternative framework rooted in &lt;strong&gt;biological transitions&lt;/strong&gt; tied to specific life stages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Emerging &lt;strong&gt;precision medicine initiatives&lt;/strong&gt; could incorporate molecular screening at midlife to predict susceptibility to chronic disease. Pharmaceutical development may also pivot toward therapies targeting the biological mechanisms that intensify around these identified inflection points.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings may be relevant for institutions developing aging-related policies, including retirement age planning, healthcare forecasting, and insurance actuarial models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The arrival of semaglutide and similar GLP-1 drugs in recent years has ushered in a new era of obesity treatment. These drugs, which mimic the GLP-1 hormone, help people lose substantially more weight than they typically would with diet and exercise alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide was developed by Novo Nordisk. It’s the active ingredient in the type 2 diabetes drug Ozempic and the obesity treatment Wegovy, both taken as a weekly shot. Though only Wegovy is approved for obesity, Ozempic has become the cultural shorthand for GLP-1 therapy (notably, Ozempic is often prescribed off-label for weight loss). But Ozempic’s reign on top looks to be coming to a close, if it isn’t already here.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly’s tirzepatide (Zepbound and Mounjaro) combines GLP-1 with a second hunger-related hormone called GIP and provides greater weight loss on average than semaglutide. And there’s a bevy of GLP-1-based drugs on the horizon vying for approval, with some likely to reach the public this year. Even Novo Nordisk is looking to upgrade its products. Last December, it &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-wegovy-pill-is-officially-here-2000702882"&gt;won&lt;/a&gt; FDA approval for a once-daily pill form of Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So here are some of the Ozempic rivals most likely to make a splash in the world of obesity treatment in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;1. Orforglipron&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Developed by Eli Lilly, orforglipron mimics the GLP-1 hormone. Unlike most GLP-1 drugs, however, it’s taken as a once-daily pill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Phase III clinical trial data &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-pill-to-fight-obesity-is-on-the-verge-of-approval-2000648312"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; last year, people on the highest dose of orforglipron lost, on average, 10% of their baseline body weight, compared to the 2.5% average weight loss seen in people taking a placebo. A study released last month also &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/eli-lillys-experimental-pill-could-help-you-ditch-glp-1-obesity-shots-trial-finds-2000701348"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that orforglipron could help people maintain most of the weight they lost on other GLP-1 drugs such as semaglutide or tirzepatide. Eli Lilly has since petitioned the FDA to approve orforglipron as an obesity treatment, with a decision expected sometime this spring.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Should it win approval, though, orforglipron will likely face some headwinds. The drug’s effectiveness might be below that of other popular drugs on the market, including Novo Nordisk’s oral version of Wegovy, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-wegovy-pill-is-officially-here-2000702882"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; late last year. But the company is banking on orforglipron having enough advantages to entice some doctors and patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For starters, many may prefer a daily pill over a weekly injection, either as a first-line treatment or as maintenance therapy. And unlike the Wegovy pill, orforglipron can be used without any food or timing restrictions (oral Wegovy needs to be taken in the morning on an empty stomach, at least 30 minutes before eating, to be most effective).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;2. CagriSema&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;CagriSema is a weekly injectable drug being developed by Novo Nordisk. It combines the GLP-1 mimic semaglutide with cagrilintide, which mimics another hunger-related hormone called amylin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In late-stage clinical trials, people taking CagriSema have lost up to 22.7% of their baseline weight over a year’s time. The company &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/novo-nordisk-files-for-fda-approval-of-cagrisema-the-first-once-weekly-combination-of-glp1-and-amylin-analogues-for-weight-management-302645862.html"&gt;officially submitted&lt;/a&gt; the drug for FDA approval in late December, with a decision expected this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If approved, CagriSema could arguably become the most effective GLP-1 drug currently available to the public. It would also signify that amylin-based drugs could be another viable approach to obesity treatment. At the same time, the Phase III results weren’t quite as impressive as Novo Nordisk appeared to be expecting (&lt;a href="https://www.pharmexec.com/view/novo-nordisk-cagrisema-falls-short-25-weight-loss-target-patients-obesity-overweight#:~:text=The%20results%20come,tirzepatide.2"&gt;25% or greater&lt;/a&gt; weight loss), and it will face stiff market competition from Eli Lilly’s existing drug tirzepatide, which has provided slightly lower but similar results in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;3. VK2735&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have dominated the landscape of GLP-1 therapy so far, but there are some competitors looking to challenge that dominance. For example, there’s Viking Therapeutics and its candidate VK2735. The drug combines GLP-1 and the hormone GIP (similar to tirzepatide) and is being developed in both an injectable and oral form.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the latest Phase II data &lt;a href="https://ir.vikingtherapeutics.com/2025-08-19-Viking-Therapeutics-Announces-Positive-Top-Line-Results-from-Phase-2-VENTURE-Oral-Dosing-Trial-of-VK2735-Tablet-Formulation-in-Patients-with-Obesity#:~:text=SAN%20DIEGO%2C%20Aug.,categorized%20as%20mild%20or%20moderate."&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; last August, people taking oral VK2735 lost up to 12% of their body weight over a 13-week period. Typically, it takes about six months to a year for a GLP-1 drug to reach its peak effectiveness, indicating that VK2735’s ceiling hasn’t been reached yet. That said, the drug did have a relatively high dropout rate of 28%, with most related to gastrointestinal events like vomiting. Though GI symptoms are a common side effect of GLP-1 therapy, the discontinuation rate was higher than those &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183#:~:text=More%20participants%20in%20the%20semaglutide%20group%20than%20in%20the%20placebo%20group%20(7.0%25%20vs.%203.1%25)%20discontinued%20treatment%20owing%20to%20adverse%20events%20(mainly%20gastrointestinal%20events)%20(Table%203%20and%20Fig.%20S9)."&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; with other GLP-1 drugs like semaglutide, so it’s at least something to keep an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The company is moving forward with its development of VK2735, having &lt;a href="https://ir.vikingtherapeutics.com/2025-06-25-Viking-Therapeutics-Announces-Initiation-of-Phase-3-Obesity-Clinical-Program-with-GLP-1-GIP-Agonist-VK2735"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; two Phase III trials last June.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. MariTide&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another potential rival to Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk might come from Amgen’s MariTide, short for maridebart cafraglutide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MariTide has some intriguing differences compared to current drugs. It’s intended to be taken as an injection once a month, as opposed to the weekly injections required by current GLP-1s. The drug also takes a different chemical approach to treating obesity. While it still mimics GLP-1 activity, it also blocks the hormone GIP, in contrast to drugs like tirzepatide and VK2735, which mimic both GLP-1 and GIP.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, this alternate approach appears promising. In &lt;a href="https://www.amgen.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/06/results-from-amgens-phase-2-obesity-study-of-monthly-maritide-presented-at-the-american-diabetes-association-85th-scientific-sessions"&gt;Phase II clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;, people with obesity have lost up to 20% of their weight over a year’s time while taking MariTide. People with type 2 diabetes also lost up to 17%, which is notable since people with diabetes typically lose substantially less weight on GLP-1 therapy than those without diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Amgen is currently conducting several Phase III trials of MariTide. Should it eventually win approval, the drug could offer a more convenient option for some potential users while also illustrating that there’s more than one way to treat obesity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Retatrutide&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Retatrutide is being developed by Eli Lilly, and it might be the most hyped experimental drug seen so far.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In clinical trial data &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/eli-lillys-weight-loss-superdrug-worked-so-well-during-trials-some-quit-over-losing-too-much-2000698424"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; last month, people with obesity and knee osteoarthritis taking retatrutide lost up to 71 pounds over 68 weeks’ time, or nearly 30% of their baseline weight. Those results appear to be the most impressive documented for any weight loss drug to date and come close to matching the average effectiveness seen with traditional bariatric surgeries. Users also experienced a substantial reduction in knee pain.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Retatrutide’s effectiveness likely stems from it mimicking not one, not two, but three hormones that regulate our hunger and metabolism at once: GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The drug probably isn’t going to be for everyone. Some people might simply not need or want to lose that much weight, and there is some early evidence that the drug’s side effects might be a bit more intolerable than drugs like semaglutide. Still, given the sheer potential effectiveness on display here, retatrutide could certainly become the next big thing in weight loss treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly plans to release results from other Phase III studies of retatrutide in 2026, with an FDA approval likely not too far down the road.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Rejuva&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fractyl Health’s &lt;a href="https://www.fractyl.com/our-platforms/rejuva/"&gt;Rejuva&lt;/a&gt; isn’t as close to reaching the public as the other drugs mentioned so far. But it is the most futuristic-sounding option on the list.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s an injectable gene therapy designed to boost the body’s own production of GLP-1, possibly for life. Early studies in mice have suggested that a single course of Rejuva might be able to match the benefits seen with other GLP-1-based drugs. The company also argues that Rejuva could be easier to tolerate, since the therapy would really only stimulate added production in response to food, as opposed to the high circulating levels of GLP-1 induced by drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The company is developing Rejuva for type 2 diabetes and obesity, with its obesity therapy intended to boost both GLP-1 and GIP production. It’s &lt;a href="https://ir.fractyl.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fractyl-health-announces-potent-preclinical-results-rjva-002"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to start the first human trial of Rejuva, for people with poorly controlled diabetes, this year.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/excessive-sitting-raises-risk-of-early-death-now-we-know-how-much"&gt;Excessive sitting&lt;/a&gt; isn't good for a person's physical or mental health, but there's a type of sedentary activity that may not &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sitting-could-be-shrinking-your-brain-and-exercise-may-not-help"&gt;shrink our brains&lt;/a&gt; or cost our cognition to the same extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic review of 85 studies has now found good reason to differentiate between 'active' sitting, like playing cards or reading, and 'passive' sitting, like watching TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former may actually boost brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's probably because active sitting engages the brain, whereas passive sitting lets a person take a back seat both physically and cognitively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-revealed-how-much-exercise-you-need-to-offset-sitting-all-day"&gt;Scientists Revealed How Much Exercise You Need to 'Offset' Sitting All Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Total sitting time has been shown to be related to brain health; however, sitting is often treated as a single entity, without considering the specific type of activity," &lt;a href="https://news.uq.edu.au/2026-01-not-all-sitting-same-when-it-comes-brain-health"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; public health researcher Paul Gardiner from the University of Queensland in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most people spend many hours sitting each day, so the type of sitting really matters … These findings show that small everyday choices – like reading instead of watching television – may help keep your brain healthier as you age."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-boosts-brain-function-across-all-ages-massive-study-confirms"&gt;exercise remains incredibly important&lt;/a&gt; for cognitive health, but giving your brain a workout is also important, and that doesn't necessarily mean you have to be on your feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189878" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189878" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/people_playing_cards_642.jpg" alt="three men at a table playing a card game" class="wp-image-189878 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/people_playing_cards_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/people_playing_cards_642-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189878" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;'Active' sitting is better for your brain than passive forms of sitting. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAGiNppUFiI/"&gt;Drs Producoes/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across numerous studies, Gardiner and colleagues found that active sitting activities, like reading, playing card games, and using a computer, showed "overwhelmingly positive associations with cognitive health, enhancing cognitive functions such as executive function, situational memory, and working memory."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, passive sitting was most consistently associated with negative cognitive outcomes, including increased &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-study-links-15-factors-to-early-dementia-risk"&gt;risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect sizes were small but significant. The study authors hope their results will help inform future health research and more nuanced health guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the researchers suggest guidelines should recognize the difference between passively watching TV and actively using a computer, and encourage people to take &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-snacks-throughout-your-day-have-real-health-benefits-study-finds"&gt;short breaks&lt;/a&gt; to stimulate their brains and move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their review focused on studies of typical sedentary activities in natural settings, rather than structured programs designed to boost brain function, making it relevant to people's everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Health advice could shift from simply saying 'sit less' to encouraging more mentally engaging activities while sitting," &lt;a href="https://news.uq.edu.au/2026-01-not-all-sitting-same-when-it-comes-brain-health"&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; Gardiner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This could help people make easy, realistic changes that support long‑term brain health and potentially reduce dementia risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13872877251394751"&gt;Journal of Alzheimer's Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Let’s take a look at his recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Get morning sunlight for 10 minutes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposing yourself to natural sunlight soon after waking helps signal the brain to regulate cortisol and melatonin levels. “This early light exposure sets your internal clock right,” explains Dr Alok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Hydrate before your first cup of caffeine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reaching for tea or coffee immediately after waking is common, but Dr Alok advises starting your day with water first. Hydrating early helps reawaken cells, supports the gut lining, and prevents sudden &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/why-do-we-wake-up-every-morning-neuroscientist-explains-cortisol-awakening-response-and-its-role-in-our-body-clock-101768829232043.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="cortisol"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt; spikes that caffeine can trigger on an empty, dehydrated body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artContent"&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Eat protein within 90 minutes of waking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skipping breakfast or relying only on carbs can destabilise blood sugar levels. Dr Alok recommends consuming protein within 90 minutes of waking to stabilise energy levels, reduce &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/anxiety" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="anxiety"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and prevent mid-morning fatigue. “Protein helps the body feel grounded and nourished early in the day,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Take a 10–15 minute walk after meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A short walk after meals can do wonders for digestion and &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-shares-5-hard-truths-about-heart-health-that-challenge-common-misconceptions-supplements-wont-save-you-101769052470097.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="heart health"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;. According to Dr Alok, post-meal movement improves insulin sensitivity, reduces bloating, and supports smoother digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Avoid screens 30 minutes before bed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scrolling late into the night can disrupt the body’s natural sleep rhythm. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Alok stresses that stepping away from screens at least 30 minutes before bedtime allows melatonin to release properly, promoting deep sleep and cellular repair, both crucial for heart and overall health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.
