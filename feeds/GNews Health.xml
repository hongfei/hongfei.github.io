(WPVI) -- &lt;/span&gt;A Montgomery County business owner is continuing to recover in the hospital after being diagnosed with a rare flesh-eating bacterial infection, a medical emergency that has kept him hospitalized since mid-December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Peter Atkinson, 49, of North Wales, has been at Doylestown Hospital since Dec. 19 after doctors diagnosed him with necrotizing fasciitis, a rare flesh-eating bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Atkinson said the hospital's swift response saved his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If it wasn't for the help of this hospital, I would definitely be dead," Atkinson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Atkinson said his illness initially felt like the flu. He described spiking a 104-degree fever and noticing a mass in his chest area before seeking medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"How did I get this? How did this happen? Apparently, it's rare, but it's not that rare because it happened to me," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He said doctors quickly realized the severity of his condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I showed them, and it was like, wow, not even five minutes later, he came and said, 'We have to do emergency surgery. We're going to intubate you,'" Atkinson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The infection later progressed to sepsis, and his kidneys began to fail, according to his family. His sister, Marietta Atkinson, said the experience has been especially painful given their family's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Probably one of the most traumatic events in our life, second traumatic event. In 2016, we lost our sister to sepsis, very similar to what Pete had," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Family members said Atkinson began to show signs of improvement on Christmas. His wife, Sherri Paulson-Atkinson, described the emotional toll of seeing her husband hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"My husband is a fighter, he's a go-getter, he is always busy, and to see him laying there like that was really hard for me," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Atkinson owns a towing company and is unable to work for the foreseeable future. To help support the family, a friend started a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://gofund.me/7b319da18" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;fundraiser&lt;/a&gt; page that has raised $13,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The amount of people that have touched me just in the last couple of days - I can't fathom the help," Atkinson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Paulson-Atkinson said the family remains focused on his recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"He does everything for us, and we just need him back," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;Atkinson is currently on dialysis.

  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;A Catholic influencer announced Thursday that his 5-year-old son had died after an 11-day battle with a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/respiratory-health/cold-and-flu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;severe case of the flu&lt;/a&gt;, a loss that unfolded publicly as he shared updates almost daily online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;Paul J. Kim, who shares faith-based content with more than 300,000 followers &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DS-hIiekZBe/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, said his son Micah died on New Year’s Eve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an emotional video posted Thursday, Kim thanked supporters &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values/faith" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;for their prayers&lt;/a&gt; and asked for privacy as his family grieves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are so proud of him," Kim said in the video. "I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, as his dad, on behalf of my family, for all the ways you guys &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;prayed and lifted us up&lt;/a&gt; during this time. It’s been the hardest thing I’ve ever been through in my life, and it continues to be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim first shared news of Micah’s illness Dec. 21, when he posted that his son was being taken to a hospital by ambulance after a medical emergency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/aggressive-new-flu-variant-sweeps-globe-doctors-warn-severe-symptoms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘AGGRESSIVE’ NEW FLU VARIANT SWEEPS GLOBE AS DOCTORS WARN OF SEVERE SYMPTOMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The young boy was taken by ambulance Dec. 21 to a hospital. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In subsequent updates, Kim said doctors described Micah’s illness as an unusually severe case of the flu. Kim later told followers that Micah had been placed on life support and urged people to pray. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In later updates, he revealed that the flu infection had turned septic and triggered seizures. At the time, Kim said doctors described the case as &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/rare-diseases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;rare and serious&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Dec. 30 update, Kim said his son’s condition had worsened and that Micah was in a coma as doctors and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/parents" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;family members&lt;/a&gt; worked to give him as much time as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/record-breaking-flu-numbers-reported-new-york-state-sparking-warnings-from-officials" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RECORD-BREAKING FLU NUMBERS REPORTED IN NEW YORK STATE, SPARKING WARNINGS FROM OFFICIALS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to recent data, the CDC reported 288 pediatric flu deaths in the recent 2024-25 season.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/influencers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Kim’s posts&lt;/a&gt;, some of which showed Micah in the hospital, were viewed millions of times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the ordeal, Kim referred to his son as a fighter and "my hero."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a written Instagram post, he quoted Job 1:21, "The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord" and said Micah had entered "the never-ending glory, love, and peace of God." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that while his family’s hearts are broken, they continue to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/christianity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;rely on their faith&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim also asked followers to pray for his family as they learn "how to live by faith and not by sight." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/celebrity-trainer-says-tennessee-community-saved-his-5-year-old-daughter-during-cancer-battle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CELEBRITY TRAINER SAYS TENNESSEE COMMUNITY SAVED HIS 5-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER DURING CANCER BATTLE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kim first shared news of his son's illness Dec. 21. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to recent data, the CDC reported 288 pediatric deaths in the 2024-25 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been a record high for a non-pandemic year, mostly among unvaccinated kids, with 70% having underlying conditions like asthma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, a new so-called "super flu" strain has emerged this season, a mutation of influenza A H3N2 called subclade K. It's highly contagious and aggressive and is sweeping the nation this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, around 20,000 children under 5 are said to be hospitalized annually, with younger children (under 6 months) facing the highest mortality risk, highlighting the importance of annual vaccination, according to &lt;a class="H23r4e" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/children.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the CDC.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital's Angelica Stabile contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="article-meta"&gt;&lt;div class="author-bio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Bussey is a breaking news writer for Fox News Digital.

The main feature is an itchy, spotty rash which blisters then scabs over. It can be painful, and cover the body from head to toe. Children often feel unwell for several days, with a fever and muscle aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It also spreads easily. Some 90% of children under the age of 10 catch chickenpox at some point, and a week off school or nursery is fairly common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But it can develop into something more severe, warns Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, deputy director of immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"For some babies, young children and even adults, chickenpox can be very serious, leading to hospital admission and tragically, while rare, it can be fatal," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Complications can include bacterial infection of scabs, and much more rarely, a swelling of the brain known as encephalitis, lung inflammation known as pnemonitis, and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Young babies and adults are more likely to be seriously ill with the infection.

There were concerns over the costs of a UK-wide vaccination programme and a potential rise in cases of shingles - when the chickenpox virus is reactivated in adulthood - but that has not been found to be an issue after many years of vaccination in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Recent research also shows the scale of the impact of chickenpox on children and the NHS. An estimated £24 million in income and productivity is lost every year in the UK due to chickenpox in childhood, NHS England says. It also calculates that the vaccine rollout could save £15 million a year in NHS treatment costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;For all those reasons, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises UK health departments, recommended the introduction of the vaccine on the NHS in November 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Families will save both time and money - no longer facing lost income from taking time off work or having to fork out for private vaccinations," Streeting said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said it was "welcome news" that a vaccine was being rolled out across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Meanwhile the Royal College of GPs said all NHS childhood vaccines were safe and effective, adding that jabs were "some of the most important health interventions parents can make for their children".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Who can get a chickenpox vaccine, and when?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d786/live/9613feb0-e5a6-11f0-b84b-6d40b6925787.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Close-up of a spot-covered chest of a young boy with chickenpox - the spots are red and blistered, covering his torso, neck and chin" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Protection against chickenpox is offered in a new, combined vaccine called MMRV, which will replace the current MMR jab.

DHHS also noted that 40 Utahns have been diagnosed with measles over &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51416341/utah-has-a-115-confirmed-cases-of-measles-with-latest-infection-at-bingham-high" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;the past three weeks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Southwest Utah Health District leads the state's case count with 114 confirmed infections, followed by the &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51422706/6-new-measles-cases-reported-in-utah-county" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;Utah County Health District&lt;/a&gt; with 16, and the Wasatch County Health District, which has a total of 9 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah's rise in measles cases is just a glimpse of the virus's impact across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though, the Utah-Arizona border, as well as the upstate region of South Carolina, which have all seen ongoing outbreaks of the virus have continuously added to the dozens of reported cases each week, &lt;a href="https://corecms.ksl.com/tools/cms/article/51425709" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;CNN reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, there have been 2,065 confirmed measles cases reported in the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;. A higher annual total of infections than the country had seen in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Utah-Arizona border accounts for more than 350 cases reported between the two states alone in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 2,065 measles cases across the U.S., 11% of those have resulted in hospitalizations; with three confirmed deaths due to the illness, the CDC reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time the country had 2,000 cases of measles reported in one year was in 1992, which was a couple of years after health leaders updated recommendations to say that children should get two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine instead of just one, CNN reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past quarter-century, measles has been considered eliminated in the United States. Since 2000, no outbreaks or other chains of transmission have lasted longer than a year. But now multiple large outbreaks in 2025 may be connected, which puts the elimination status at risk, if cases continue to grow through late January, according to CNN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC,  measles is one of the most contagious diseases known, but the MMR vaccine offers effective protection. Health officials state that one dose of the vaccine is 93% effective against measles infection and a second dose provides 97% protection against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the CDC said vaccination rates have been on the decline for several years, especially among young children. During the 2024-25 school year, only 92.5% of incoming kindergarten students have received the MMR vaccine, which is below the 95% threshold, health officials say, is necessary to alleviate outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 156 individuals in Utah who contracted measles in 2025, the DHHS said 140 of those were not vaccinated. Nine of those were vaccinated and seven patients' vaccination status was unknown, &lt;a href="https://files.epi.utah.gov/Utah%20measles%20dashboard.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;according to the department's website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels.

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 350 to 400 calories while the lunches span 350 to 400 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a 1,200 calorie modification?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_203-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although adequate protein plays an important role in weight loss, there are other lifestyle factors that work hand in hand to support lasting results. These include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_204-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_205-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular exercise&lt;/strong&gt;: While &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-protein-and-its-benefits-11732679" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; provides the building blocks your muscles need to grow and function properly, exercise is the trigger that stimulates muscle growth and helps your body use that protein effectively. For this reason, it’s recommended to do strength training exercises at least twice a week to boost muscle and metabolic health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You should also participate in 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise each week. This includes walking, dancing, biking or water aerobics.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good quality sleep&lt;/strong&gt;: Diet and exercise may be important, but if you aren’t getting enough sleep, you may not see the weight loss results you desire. Studies show that inadequate sleep is linked to increased cravings, particularly for foods high in carbohydrates and fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Aim for at least 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress management&lt;/strong&gt;: If you feel like you’ve tried everything to lose weight and nothing is working, managing stress may be the missing piece to the puzzle. Chronic stress exposes your body to high levels of cortisol, which is linked to the development of obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Try meditation, breath work, therapy, socialization or getting regular fresh air and sunshine to help reduce stress levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietitians thoughtfully create EatingWell’s meal plans to be easy-to-follow and delicious. Each meal plan meets specific parameters depending on the health condition and/or lifestyle goal it is targeting and is analyzed for accuracy using the nutrition database, ESHA Food Processor. As nutritional needs differ from person to person, we encourage you to use these plans as inspiration and adjust as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, as his dad, on behalf of my family, for all the ways you guys prayed and lifted us up during this time,” Kim said in the video. “This incredibly difficult, impossible time for our family. It’s been the hardest thing I’ve ever been through in my life, and it continues to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d12275" class="body-graf"&gt;On Dec. 21, Kim &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSjAAswjuSX/" target="_blank"&gt;posted on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; that his son was heading to the hospital in an ambulance after “having a medical emergency.” The next day, he posted an update on Instagram saying Micah was on life support and asked for prayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-670532" class="body-graf"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DS3vY0XjRe-/" target="_blank"&gt;update on Dec. 30&lt;/a&gt;, Kim said his son had a severe case of the flu, which caused the child to go septic and experience seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1772d5" class="body-graf"&gt;“The doctors are saying it’s one of the most horrific cases of this virus that they have ever seen in their life. It’s very rare, what happened to my son,” Kim said. “Rest assured, he needs a miracle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0fd335" class="body-graf"&gt;Kim posted updates nearly daily since then, several including videos of the 5-year-old unconscious in the hospital.

&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;Illy was a well-known Scottish &lt;a class="hover:text-vertical-primary underline decoration-2 underline-offset-4 decoration-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/vtubers/"&gt;VTuber&lt;/a&gt; who was transparent about her struggles with &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class="hover:text-vertical-primary underline decoration-2 underline-offset-4 decoration-vertical-primary" href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/cystic-fibrosis"&gt;cystic fibrosis&lt;/a&gt;, a genetic disease that progressively fills the lungs and other organs with mucus, causing breathing problems, infections, and issues absorbing nutrients from food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;In August 2025, Illy created a fundraiser for her ‘bucket list,’ which included activities like seeing a Vocaloid concert, going to conventions and theme parks, and “throwing a big party” with her friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;“She was rushed to the hospital,” Drumsy said in a &lt;a class="hover:text-vertical-primary underline decoration-2 underline-offset-4 decoration-vertical-primary" href="https://www.dexerto.com/youtube/"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; video explaining the situation. “I got a call from her mom letting me know that the doctors said there was nothing else they could do. They kept her medicated and made sure that she wasn’t in pain. She passed away peacefully in her sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;Fans were left heartbroken at the news, sharing their support for Illy’s friends and family and reminiscing on their favorite moments from her broadcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;“This was way too soon,” one wrote on YouTube. “I’m sorry, Drumsy.

&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;“Illy was by far my favourite because of her personality and doing the dumbest stuff possible with the biggest smile on her face,” another said on X. “Thank you so much, Illy, for being yourself and just doing what you liked and loved.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;To end his video, Drumsy shared an audio recording from Illy during one of their last collaborations together, where she thanked her fans and supporters for rallying around her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An exoskeleton for the entire arm has been invented and designed in Norway to help stroke victims recover the use of their arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It detects and then amplifies tiny movements through the arm and shoulder, and the developers hope to launch it as a fully commercial product this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, more and more people are surviving strokes, and living longer and longer with  disabilities resulting from them. This creates the need for better therapies, accommodations, and regenerative treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://viljebionics.com/vre-brukere"&gt;Vilje Bionics&lt;/a&gt;, the company behind the shoulder-mounted exoskeleton, says that most below-the-elbow prosthetics are for amputees, an few if any exist for victims of partial paralysis—like Johanne Marie Hemnes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017 Hemnes suffered a brain hemorrhage and collapsed in her living room. The resulting stroke paralyzed her down her left side—usually the result of a stroke in the right half of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All her rehab and focus was on the left leg to ensure she could walk again, and while that was successful, her arm was entirely neglected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I call my arm Jenny, because it feels like it’s not a part of me, because it doesn’t do what I want it to do,” she&lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/11/08/this-is-the-worlds-first-entire-arm-exoskeleton-giving-stroke-patients-more-independence" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; told Euro News&lt;/a&gt;, adding that she even considered cutting it off because it just got in the way. “But when I actually have this on, it feels like me again. It doesn’t just feel like another human being’s arm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vilje Bionics’ robotic arm assists movements for the shoulder, elbow and hand, which makes it the world’s first exoskeleton for the entire arm. Many of the components were 3D-printed, and Vilje’s founder Saeid Hosseini, says it works by the user “thinking how they’d use their arm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because if you think, you make a small movement and then it amplifies that movement,” Hosseini said. “It detects very small movements of a residual movement of a paretic arm and amplifies those movements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXOSKELETON INVENTIONS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;40 people have trailed the Vilpower exoskeleton so far, and the company hopes it will be ready in the first 4 to 6 months of 2026 starting in Norway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The robotic arm may be used for rehabilitation purposes in the future, but the company is currently focusing on helping “patients with lasting and significant disabilities to be more independent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the World Stroke Organization, one in four people will suffer a stroke at some point in their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hemnes has been able to get used to cutting vegetables and opening bottles again, exactly the kind of independence Hosseini wants his product’s users to be able to reclaim.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- Kentucky health officials are warning the public after a case of measles was confirmed in northern Kentucky earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A post on the Kentucky Department for Public Health's Facebook page said it has "identified potential measles exposures in Grant County, Kentucky." According to the post, the exposure was traced to "an unvaccinated, out-of-state traveler" who stayed at the Holiday Inn &amp;amp; Suites in Dry Ridge from Dec. 28-30. That person also visited the Ark Encounter on Dec. 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles, a highly contagious respiratory virus, can cause serious health problems, especially in young children and the elderly. The virus spreads through the air after someone infected coughs or sneezes. It can then linger for up to two hours after the infected person leaves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus can also be spread if someone touches surfaces that an infected person has touched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include a cough, runny nose and red eyes, followed by white spots that appear on the face and down the body. Two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine is the best protection against measles, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact your healthcare provider if you think you or someone in your family may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Local News:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/politics/heres-a-look-at-who-s-running-and-what-s-at-stake-in-kentucky-s/article_5d13b267-215a-4a5b-b378-361ab697ff8e.html" target="_blank"&gt;Here's a look at who’s running and what’s at stake in Kentucky’s 2026 elections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="6181" data-end="6433"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/crime-reports/woman-critical-after-shooting-at-american-legion-post-in-parkland-early-thursday/article_4fa05d9b-c356-4f28-946a-23c5e6d8eed9.html" target="_blank"&gt;Woman critical after shooting at American Legion post in Parkland early Thursday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="x_MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/crime-reports/woman-dies-after-shooting-outside-fast-food-restaurant-in-downtown-louisville-near-nulu/article_977afb3b-b61e-4c1c-9330-23d38632bd56.html" target="_blank"&gt;Woman dies after shooting outside fast food restaurant in downtown Louisville near NuLu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="3357" data-end="3568"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/business/contract-details-reveal-when-kentucky-could-seek-repayment-from-blueoval-sk/article_08b61010-b9a6-4b95-aa0a-d26b4948e52d.html" target="_blank"&gt;Contract details reveal when Kentucky could seek repayment from BlueOval SK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="3357" data-end="3568"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/federal-judge-dismisses-consent-decree-meant-to-spark-police-reform-in-louisville/article_1894e619-0355-4d5a-bafb-f0ecb97519cc.html" target="_blank"&gt;Federal judge dismisses consent decree meant to spark police reform in Louisville&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="3357" data-end="3568"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/dozens-of-vacancies-raise-safety-concerns-at-louisville-metro-corrections/article_e7da36c1-ad09-434d-97be-991f733bad68.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dozens of vacancies raise safety concerns at Louisville Metro Corrections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="3357" data-end="3568"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/louisville-doctors-urge-prevention-as-flu-cases-surge-after-the-holidays/article_32d375de-5ee1-4f3d-a6bb-75cf6bb7658d.html" target="_blank"&gt;Louisville doctors urge prevention as flu cases surge after the holidays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wdrb.com/news/lmpd-detective-shared-login-to-flock-camera-system-with-dea-agent-conducting-immigration-search/article_03cc732a-3f04-444e-9eee-ad4d2f5dc848.html" target="_blank"&gt;LMPD detective shared login to Flock camera system with DEA agent conducting immigration search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Copyright 2026 WDRB Media.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Greek-style yogurt is one of the key components of the Mediterranean diet.

Unlike traditional yogurt, Greek-style yogurt is strained, resulting in a thicker texture and a higher amount of protein. It has also been associated with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290873/how-to-lower-triglycerides-ldl-cholesterol/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower levels of triglycerides&lt;/a&gt; and cholesterol, which can decrease the risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Combining the yogurt with other nutritious foods that align with the Mediterranean dietary principles,  such as antioxidant-rich berries and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nut-for-heart-health-8604884" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;omega-3-packed walnuts&lt;/a&gt;, adds a source of fiber and heart-healthy fats.

Cottage cheese has grown in popularity due to its versatility. It pairs well with traditional Mediterranean flavors and can easily be transformed into a savory, protein-rich snack. Just a ½ cup of low-fat cottage cheese provides approximately 12 grams of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-quality protein&lt;/a&gt;, which can help with weight loss and long-term weight maintenance. Because protein takes longer to digest, it helps promote satiety, or feelings of fullness, and may reduce overall calorie intake by keeping hunger at bay in between meals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Due to their lycopene content, tomatoes regularly may help protect against heart disease by neutralizing inflammation that contributes to plaque buildup in the arteries.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Pairing the cottage cheese with fresh herbs and tomatoes creates a balanced, satiating snack combining protein-rich dairy and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-antioxidant-rich-foods-you-should-eat-11776388" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;antioxidant-rich vegetables&lt;/a&gt; with flavorful, minimally processed ingredients.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_80-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Healthy snacking doesn’t have to be complicated; it's all about balance and intention. Start with these simple tips:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_81-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_82-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair protein with fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; Combining protein with fiber-rich foods like fruits, vegetables or whole grains supports fullness and helps to stabilize energy levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind portion sizes:&lt;/strong&gt; Remember that snacks are meant to complement meals, not replace them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include healthy fats:&lt;/strong&gt; Olive oil, nuts, and seeds help to enhance flavor and build out the nutrient profile of your snack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan ahead:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.mycrohnsandcolitisteam.com/writers/683f0deb46c7aa1e0f3349e2" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Avery Zenker, RDN, BASc, MAN&lt;/a&gt; recommends &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7943165/dietitian-approved-make-ahead-snack-recipes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;preparing snacks ahead of time&lt;/a&gt; so they're ready to go when you're hungry, which makes healthier choices easier throughout the week. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include variety:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://holtonnutrition.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kara Holton, MS, RDN, LDN, MCHES &lt;/a&gt;suggests "eating a variety of different snacks throughout the week can keep you interested and excited about your food", and can also help you get in all those important nutrients that are helpful for your health overall.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_85-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High-protein snacks can easily fit within the Mediterranean diet when they emphasize whole foods, healthy fats, and variety. From Greek yogurt and legumes to seafood and dairy, these snacks deliver at least 7 grams of protein per serving while supporting heart health and promoting satiety. With thoughtful snack choices, it’s possible to stay energized, support heart health, and enjoy foods that align with the principles of a Mediterranean diet.&lt;br&gt;

African Americans also have higher rates of health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, both of which increase the risk of developing AD.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many previous studies have examined gene expression (measure of the amount of protein encoded by a gene) in brain tissue from people with Alzheimer's compared with those without the disease. However, most of this research focused on EA or mixed-ancestry groups. In many cases, the number of AA participants was either not reported or too small to allow meaningful conclusions about genetic patterns specific to this population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Largest Brain Study Identifies New Alzheimer's Genes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the largest Alzheimer's study to date using brain tissue from African American donors, scientists at Boston University Chobanian &amp;amp; Avedisian School of Medicine identified numerous genes that behaved differently in people with AD compared with individuals without the disease. Many of these genes had not been previously linked to Alzheimer's by other genetic studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strongest signal came from the ADAMTS2 gene. Researchers found that its activity level was 1.5 fold higher in brain tissue from individuals with autopsy-confirmed AD than in tissue from controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistent Findings Across Independent Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed gene expression data from post-mortem prefrontal cortex tissue collected from 207 AA brain donors, including 125 individuals with pathologically confirmed AD and 82 controls. These samples came from 14 NIH-funded AD Research Centers across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADAMTS2 stood out as the most significantly differentially expressed gene in this group. It also ranked first in an independent study (&lt;a href="http://medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.12.24317218v1"&gt;medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.12.24317218v1&lt;/a&gt;) conducted by the same researchers using brain tissue from a much larger group of EA individuals. That study compared people with confirmed Alzheimer's pathology who showed clinical symptoms before death with individuals who had the same pathology but remained cognitively resilient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To our knowledge, this is the first time in similarly designed AD genetics studies that the most significant finding was the same in both white and African Americans," said corresponding author Lindsay A. Farrer, PhD, chief of biomedical genetics at the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Understanding Alzheimer's Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say the findings represent a meaningful advance in understanding the genetic foundations of Alzheimer's risk in African Americans. Previous evidence suggests that most known AD risk variants tend to be population-specific or occur at different frequencies across groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although risk of AD in African Americans has been associated with variants in several genes, the overlap of genes showing association in in EA populations is modest, and even among the overlapping genes the particular variants involved and the size of the effect on AD risk usually differ," explains Farrer. "The fact that expression of ADAMTS2 is significantly and substantially higher in brain tissue from both Whites and Blacks with AD not only points to a shared biological process leading to AD, but also elevates the priority of further research involving this gene which could determine its suitability as a potential therapeutic target."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were published online in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was supported by National Institute of Health grants R01-AG048927, U01-AG058654, U54-AG052427, U19-AG068753, U01-AG062602, P30-AG072978, U01-081230, P01-AG003949, P30-AG062677, P30-AG062421; P30-AG 066507, P30-AG066511, P30-AG 072972, P30-AG066468, R01-AG072474, RF1-AG066107, U24-AG056270, P01-AG003949 , RF1-AG082339, RF1-NS118584, P30-AG072946; P01-AG003991, P30-AG066444, P01-AG026276, P30-AG066462, P30-AG072958, and P30-AG072978, as well as Florida Department of Health awards 8AZ06 and 20A22.

The core idea is that facial aging provides a visual estimate of the body's internal biological age and its susceptibility to age-related diseases, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15353809/cause-dementia-risk-Alzheimers-kidney-disease.html"&gt;including those affecting the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking older than your chronological age is not just about skin-deep wrinkles or sunspots. Instead, it is a visible indicator of your systemic biological age, which may be older than your chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pronounced crow's feet may be a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15328929/Surprising-new-risk-factor-dementia-discovered-largest-study-33-million-Americans-vulnerable.html"&gt;particularly sensitive biomarker&lt;/a&gt; because they reflect cumulative environmental damage. Heavy sun damage is a source of systemic oxidative stress and inflammation, which are key pathways also implicated in brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crow’s feet also visually represent the skin's biological resilience, or lack thereof. If this thin, vulnerable area shows advanced aging, it may signal that the body's repair mechanisms, such as collagen production and antioxidant defenses, are struggling system-wide, including in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors concluded: ‘Facial age (both subjective/perceived and objective) could serve as an indicator and applied into screening strategies for identifying and treating risk population of cognitive decline or dementia in early intervention for older adults.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A major study has found that people who appear older than their actual age face a more than 60 percent greater risk of developing dementia over a 12-year period (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers conducted two distinct studies to build a compelling case. This dual approach was designed to find an initial signal and then validate it, making their conclusion much stronger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the first study included in the report, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11539626/#Sec9"&gt;Alzheimer's Research &amp;amp; Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used health data of more than 195,000 Brits 60 and up as part of the UK Biobank Study over 12 years on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the first of two studies, participants in the UK answered the survey question: 'Do people say that you look younger than you are, older than you are, or about your age?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After accounting for factors like age, health and lifestyle, they found those who reported looking older had a 61 percent higher risk of dementia compared to those who reported looking younger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The link between looking older according to what other people thought and a higher dementia risk was not the same for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The connection was strongest in three specific groups: people with obesity, people who spent more time outside during the summer and people who had a higher genetic risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk was elevated across different types of dementia, most notably for vascular dementia, which saw a 55 percent higher risk, as well as unspecified dementia, which saw a 74 percent increased risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk of Alzheimer’s and perceived aging, or what other people say about them, was present, though not very strong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jana Nelson was 50 when diagnosed with early onset dementia, following severe personality changes and a sharp cognitive decline that left her unable to solve simple math problems or name colors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The connection between looking older than one's chronological age and having an increased risk for dementia and cognitive impairment held true for most people, regardless of their sex, education or many other health factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those perceived as older by others were more likely to be smokers, men and physically inactive. They also showed higher rates of depressive symptoms and other health conditions than those who felt they looked younger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also tested participants' current thinking skills and found that those who reported looking older tended to perform worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They scored lower on tests of processing speed and executive function and had slower reaction times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the second study published in the same report, researchers took a different approach. It was conducted in a completely separate study population of around 600 older adults in China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They showed photographs of participants to a panel of 50 independent assessors who were asked to guess each person's age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analyzing this data, they found that for every year older a person was judged to look compared to their real age, their odds of having measurable cognitive impairment increased by 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to having assessors guess ages from photos, the researchers used specialized imaging to objectively count and measure wrinkles, particularly crow's feet around the eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rebecca Luna's (pictured here) early-onset Alzheimer's symptoms appeared in her late 40s. She would black out mid-conversation, lose her keys and leave the stove before returning to find her kitchen full of smoke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The scan shows a brain afflicted with Alzheimer's. The front of the brain is at top in this view from below. The progression of this degenerative disease has caused atrophy in both halves of the brain, but especially at upper right and upper left (lighter brown areas). The ventricles (center, white) have also been affected and are dilated from their normal size &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, they counted the total number of wrinkles above the cheeks and around the eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, they performed the Line Wrinkle Contrast, which measures the visibility or prominence of the wrinkles by analyzing how much they stand out from the surrounding skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of all the measurements taken, the parameters for crow's feet wrinkles, specifically the total number and contrast, showed the strongest and most significant association with cognitive impairment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measurements from the cheek area and other skin metrics, like hydration and elasticity, did not show as strong a link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The aging process causes a cascade of physiological effects beyond neurological ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cardiovascular disorders, including heart attack and high blood pressure, type two diabetes, osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and many types of cancers share common underlying drivers, including chronic inflammation and cellular aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chronic diseases, as well as accumulated stress, DNA damage, inflammation and hormonal changes, can all be seen on a person’s face, they concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chronic inflammation plays a leading role in the pathology of dementia. It drives neuronal damage, accelerates brain aging and is a common thread linking many dementia risk factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This study's findings suggest that facial aging may be a visible sign of this same systemic inflammatory process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 14:45:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPN0tVWTJ5TXYtSkVvUnFUaFNfYWhHRGs4eTFYUDRKUnBIU2J6UFB3Y2lPQzQ3LXRWYXRXTFNMYlduTUx4NmhWRlNacVhOR3RMMlI2VWgwUUlqQi1FcDhLN2gzcEN1a1ZUR0pRcS1DbEJUWlZ5R2ZwT1llSUdySk9JRmZoM0xwd1hZSEVFU05zTWs5SWdxcVowSGYtUXJCRDN1LUNhOTVZQlh5Z9IBrwFBVV95cUxPUWhlWEJZNXhmRXMydmNVOGN5VlJZSmloRENyZFpKLWZUMnIzVnZpYXBXS3U1VW82QnZtaWtGWndUb0YzSWtER3ZVb0V0eWVZRE80d3RFVTRjNUlyTk5SczU2amMtUk11VzRURHB5WXNBMjI2RkVadDJjMDdrVlBPZUpWTDloUnlmRVQ3eVExUTZwdjNQakhTWWVGTEZ1SGw4MU03cU5YYTBxR3A3eTlR</guid></item><item><title>你吃东西是为了长寿吗？参加此测验以了解详情。-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2026/healthy-eating-longevity-quiz/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story relative"&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="noscript-warning"&gt;Warning: This graphic requires JavaScript.

Whether you scored high or low (or somewhere in between), what matters is that by taking this quiz, you’ve identified where you can make improvements in your diet. Even small changes can have a big impact on your health and life expectancy. And it’s never too late to start. Studies show that no matter how old you are or where you’re at food-wise, you can gain sizable health benefits at any age by cutting back on highly processed foods loaded with salt, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2025/breakfast-added-sugar/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;sugar&lt;/a&gt; and other additives and replacing them with fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, peas, lentils, seafood and whole grains. We recommend bookmarking this page and checking back in three months to see how you’ve improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="PJLV wpds-c-fwOiRn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-czTphm"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-hEgojh wpds-c-hEgojh-idWlhdm-css component-card"&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-iFKWRt wpds-c-iFKWRt-iKuYGR-level-5 wpds-c-iFKWRt-ifepmnN-css component-heading-5"&gt;About this story&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-ikHxsIg-css component-text"&gt;Editing by Emily Codik and Theresa Tamkins.

You'll probably get a lot of different answers based on the typical patient population in the area, but the most common things I've seen are &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hypertension" target="_blank"&gt;hypertensive&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/treatment-care/hyperglycemia" target="_blank"&gt;hyperglycemic&lt;/a&gt; events for patients who are noncompliant with their medications. Their complaints are usually quite vague (headache, dizziness, weakness, abdominal pain), and the physical examination is unremarkable. Vitals, BMP, UA, and past medical history make it pretty obvious pretty quickly, especially when the patient's previous encounters are already in your system."&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new genetic study published in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/em&gt; has revealed rare biological traits that may explain why &lt;em&gt;Maria Branyas&lt;/em&gt;, one of the oldest recorded humans,&lt;strong&gt; lived to 117 &lt;/strong&gt;with remarkably good health. Based on comprehensive biological samples collected before her passing in 2024, researchers have identified genetic and physiological clues that may reshape our understanding of aging and how to prolong human life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Inside The Biology Of A Supercentenarian&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maria Branyas defied the expected trajectory of human aging. Scientists from the Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute in Barcelona conducted a full analysis of her blood, saliva, stool, and &lt;em&gt;urine&lt;/em&gt;, revealing that many of her body’s cellular markers appeared decades younger than her chronological age. The researchers believe her case can unlock vital pathways for healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike most people her age, &lt;strong&gt;Branyas &lt;/strong&gt;exhibited low inflammation, excellent cardiovascular health, and an immune system comparable to people several decades younger. Her gut microbiome also displayed strong resilience. The results suggest a rare genomic profile that protected her against age-related decline. The study, published in&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2025.102368" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, outlines how Branyas carried rare gene variants linked to healthy brain function, robust immunity, and resistance to chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Extreme human lifespan, exemplified by supercentenarians, presents a paradox in understanding aging: despite advanced age, they maintain relatively good health,” write the researchers, led by epigeneticists &lt;em&gt;Eloy Santos-Pujol&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Aleix Noguera-Castells&lt;/em&gt;. Her &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/dna-reveals-story-of-beachy-head-woman/" data-type="post" data-id="100171"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt;, paired with a Mediterranean diet rich in &lt;em&gt;yogurt&lt;/em&gt; and a physically and socially active lifestyle, may have created the perfect storm for exceptional longevity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why Her DNA Could Change Longevity Research&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes Branyas’ case especially intriguing is that her &lt;em&gt;genomic youth&lt;/em&gt; didn’t match her chronological age. While her telomeres, chromosomal caps linked to aging, were notably short, which is usually a warning sign, she never developed cancer. The researchers theorize that shorter telomeres in this case may have &lt;em&gt;limited cellular overgrowth&lt;/em&gt;, acting as a cancer-prevention mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, the paradox of her health may turn traditional aging biomarkers on their head. Most aging models suggest that short telomeres mean a shorter life, yet Branyas challenges that view. Her cellular aging may have followed a different, more controlled pathway. This surprising insight could shift how scientists design future therapies for aging and disease prevention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The picture that emerges from our study, although derived only from this one exceptional individual, shows that extremely advanced age and poor health are not intrinsically linked,” write the study authors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team stresses that broader studies are needed to confirm their findings, but Branyas’ case offers a compelling starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What Sets Supercentenarians Apart From The Rest?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Supercentenarians like Branyas represent only a tiny fraction of the population, just &lt;em&gt;1 in 10 people&lt;/em&gt; who reach 100 survive to 110. While her lifestyle certainly played a role, the study emphasizes that &lt;em&gt;genetic architecture&lt;/em&gt; is likely the primary differentiator. Larger studies have also found consistent patterns among long-lived individuals, including higher levels of &lt;em&gt;good cholesterol&lt;/em&gt;, better inflammation control, and unique gut flora compositions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her ability to stay &lt;em&gt;mentally, physically, and socially active&lt;/em&gt; into her final years paints a picture of aging that is &lt;em&gt;resilient&lt;/em&gt;, not degenerative. And though this research focused on a single person, its implications are vast. The authors propose using this type of data to identify &lt;em&gt;biomarkers for healthy aging&lt;/em&gt; and develop &lt;em&gt;personalized longevity therapies&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the global population of centenarians rapidly grows, understanding why some people defy the odds could unlock new strategies to extend not just lifespan but healthspan, the number of years lived in good health.&lt;/p&gt;

Rather, every time you remember something, that memory changes slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'We know that when we recall the memory, it's not a video of the past, but it's a reconstructive process where we pull the book of memory out of the library, and when it's at the forefront of our mind, we inadvertently start sketching details into that memory.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next step to manipulate those memories through science, he claimed, is 'pretty simple.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drugs could be used to target cells holding specific memories, he said. Cognitive behavioral therapy or positive cues could also help make the desired changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'None of that breaks any law of physics. There's just more research we need to get to that point.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He stressed that science will not erase memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's more than we can start to toggle down the emotional components, which perhaps are the debilitating components. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Or we could even toggle up some of the components, if we wanted to boost the positivity associated with a memory.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He did, however, admit that science has the potential to be abused by malicious parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'One potential problem is that people might manipulate memories to sell products, just like how, today, that five-second ad you see on social media grows in your head like a seed until it becomes a decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If we know all that information is encoded in the brain,' he added, 'even to the point of guiding behavior, we should hope that this knowledge is used for the greater good - as opposed to for selling products or for marketing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a new book, How to Change a Memory, Professor Steve Ramirez explores how emerging science may make it possible to ‘rewrite memories’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15021993/replacing-levels-common-element-reverse-memory-loss.html"&gt;experiments of his and other labs&lt;/a&gt; are still some way off from understanding exactly what patterns of brain cells are involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he said: 'If we can study how a traumatic memory is recalled, and we know the nuts and bolts of how it works, then we should be able to intervene with it in a more targeted manner in humans.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists in Geneva have already shown it’s possible to deal with addiction in this fashion, and Ramirez believes similar methods could be used to ‘reset’ the brain back to a healthy baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the most powerful benefit, he said, will be the means to reclaim ‘lost’ memories in Alzheimer’s and other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ramirez said: 'I think that's a kind of mini Holy Grail of this all, to be able to really restore what we once thought was lost, especially something as near and dear as memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There are tremendous amounts of more research we need to get there, but I think that would be what the path forward would look like.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ramirez’s own understanding of the fluidity of memory helped him deal with the untimely death of his lab partner, Xu Liu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'For me, I've come to terms with memory being the thing that shaped who I am today, for better and for worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There are certainly difficult aspects of my past, whether it's loss and grief or addiction for that matter, but I wouldn't change it because I've learned to grow my life around it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After Xu Liu's death, Ramirez began obsessively lucid dreaming about him - dreams where the dreamer can control events - and now he believes those dreams were his brain’s attempt to offer him hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'It's simultaneously my goal to honor my friend, who is the beating heart of the book, and to do justice to the memories we had together.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;How to Change a Memory: One Neuroscientist’s Quest to Alter the Past by Steve Ramirez is published by Princeton University Press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The last time there were more than 2,000 cases reported in one year was in 1992, just a couple years after health leaders updated recommendations to say that children should get two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine instead of just one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known, but the MMR vaccine offers highly effective protection. One dose is 93% effective against measles infection, and two doses are 97% effective, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, vaccination rates have been falling for years. For the 2024-25 school year, just 92.5% of incoming kindergarteners had received the MMR vaccine, CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:data;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; shows — below the 95% threshold that public health experts say is necessary to prevent outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles has been considered eliminated in the US since 2000, meaning no outbreaks or other chains of transmission have lasted longer than a year. But multiple large outbreaks in 2025 may be connected, which puts the elimination status on the line if cases continue to grow through late January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;An outbreak centered in West Texas that started in late January was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:declared over;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;declared over&lt;/a&gt; in mid-August. There were hundreds of related cases across Texas and New Mexico, and three unvaccinated people died: two children and one adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In early October, the South Carolina health department confirmed that there was a measles outbreak in the upstate region. That outbreak has spread to nearly 180 cases over the past four months and continues to grow; at least 20 new cases have been reported since Friday, and nearly 300 people are in quarantine because of exposure to a known case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We know that a large number of our cases are those who we’ve placed in quarantine because of known exposures,” Dr. Linda Bell, South Carolina’s state epidemiologist, said Tuesday. Measles continues to spread through household transmission, in schools and at churches, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;An outbreak on the Utah-Arizona line also continues to grow, with more than 350 cases reported between the two states in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In November, the Pan American Health Organization, part of the World Health Organization, determined that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Canada had lost its measles elimination status;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Canada had lost its measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt; amid a large ongoing outbreak there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s important to say that all the other 34 countries in the region, they keep their certification as measles-free,” PAHO Director Dr. Jarbas Barbosa said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But possible genetic links between the Texas outbreak and the ongoing South Carolina outbreak put that status at risk for the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The trajectory that we’re looking at now is that we do anticipate more cases well into January,” Bell said. “What that means for us nationally in terms of how they are defining our designation in this country as having eliminated measles is unclear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 12:36:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxNN0NYUkZNYWVhc1ZOMTVudGVXN0RhNG5VNi1GcC02XzF5X3plZ25MMTNUbm1SbHVtVGJpc2lzTHZfZ0dhX3JWNHBGT3REUHo1MG5PaURxN3gzcjRycmlPMnJFcHhrVXNtbElnd3NMY2pFc3F3TEFVeDFQWFFvbUhFeg</guid></item><item><title>古老的谷物被誉为“世界上最健康的碳水化合物” ，胜过糙米和藜麦- Daily Express</title><link>https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/2152392/worlds-healthiest-carb-diet</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbs get a lot of flak though they make up an important part of a &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" title="Healthy diet " href="/latest/healthy-diet" target="_blank"&gt;healthy diet&lt;/a&gt;. Granted, there's a vast difference between whole grains and ultra-processed sweets and snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis" class="inline ovp-primis-h251"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bursting with fibre and essential nutrients, grains are a cornerstone of balanced, nutritious eating. Brown rice's health credentials are well-established — brimming with protein and fibre, it's also &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/life-style/life/2145237/new-years-day-supermarket-opening-hours" target="_blank"&gt;readily available in supermarkets&lt;/a&gt; and budget-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the more fashionable end of the spectrum sits quinoa, a gluten-free seed categorised as a whole grain that contains all nine essential amino acids. Related to quinoa, amaranth is a lesser known 'grain' that flies under the radar as &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/worlds-healthiest-meat-thats-better-36404099" target="_blank"&gt;one the most nutritious foods you can eat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mce-linkchecker-status="valid"&gt;Abundant in protein and naturally gluten-free, amaranth ranks among the world's most ancient crops and was even revered by the Aztecs and Incas as possessing mystical properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What makes carbs good for you?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simple explanation for what renders certain carbohydrates beneficial is food processing. So-called 'good carbs' are whole grains, which are essentially grains that remain unprocessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British Dietary Association says a complete grain has three things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The bran: a fibre-rich outer layer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The germ: a nutrient-packed inner part&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The endosperm: a central starchy part&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, refined grains undergo processing and preserve only their endosperm. Items manufactured from processed and refined grains dominate the majority of supermarket shelves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whole grains, as they're grown in the ground, are full of nutrients," registered dietitian Ashli Greenwald told John Hopkins Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="wunderkind-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They can contain several B vitamins and trace minerals, such as iron, zinc, magnesium and copper. Some whole grains are good sources of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You also get phytonutrients: plant-based compounds that can reduce inflammation and may lower your chances of developing heart disease, diabetes and even some kinds of cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why amaranth is one of the healthiest grains you can eat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ancient superfood has earned recognition as amongst the most nutritious due to its exceptional nutrient content. The Aztecs reportedly called amaranth the "food of immortality". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being technically a seed, amaranth provides comparable &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" title="Healthy eating" href="/latest/healthy-eating" target="_blank"&gt;health advantages&lt;/a&gt; to wholegrains. With higher protein levels than rice and maize, amaranth proves remarkably filling, keeping you satisfied for extended periods whilst delivering a complete amino acid profile including lysine — rarely found in grains — plus vitamins A and C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mce-linkchecker-status="valid"&gt;Nutritionist Kerry Torrens named amaranth as the healthiest grain in an article for &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/health/nutrition/alternative-grains" target="_blank"&gt;Good Food&lt;/a&gt;, above oats, brown rice and quinoa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2020.1825323" target="_blank"&gt;Research from 2020&lt;/a&gt; examined amaranth's lesser-known advantages. Scientists discovered it serves as an excellent source of fibre, protein, and essential minerals such as calcium and iron, according to Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it provides vitamin C, folic acid, and antioxidants, as detailed in a 2019 study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder" class="loaded"&gt;&lt;mantis-ui-widget id="mantis-recommender-wrapper" data-config="{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Don't miss&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;adsEnabled&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;leaderBoardEnabled&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/mantis-ui-widget&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Six ways to eat amaranth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Porridge - as a base or sprinkled as flakes as a topping&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Popcorn - pop them in a dry pan on the hob&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Baking - it's gluten-free&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pancakes - sweet or savoury&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Salad - its green leaves are slightly sweet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With other grains - amaranth is starchy so combine it with brown rice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to cook and bake with amaranth — South Americans have consumed amaranth for millennia. Its gentle, nutty taste works brilliantly in both savoury and sweet dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple way to incorporate it into your diet is by using it as a substitute for oats in porridge. Ann Ziata, a chef-instructor at the Institute of Culinary Education, shared with &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/8222370/amaranth-grain-guide" target="_blank"&gt;Martha Stewart&lt;/a&gt; that she enjoys it with dates, sesame seeds, apricots, almonds, and a dash of cinnamon and maple syrup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to whole grains, amaranth is also available as flour and flakes. It's readily &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" rel="nofollow" href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=76202X1536635&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollandandbarrett.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2Fbiona-organic-amaranth-500g-6100001752&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.getsurrey.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fhealth%2Fworlds-healthiest-carbohydrate-ancient-grain-31412751" target="_blank"&gt;available at Holland and Barrett&lt;/a&gt;, where you can purchase 500g for £3.69.

    &lt;p&gt;Every January, internet searches for the terms “diet” and “weight loss” surge, gyms become busier and diet trends spread across social media. But research shows that most people who try the latest quick-fix plan do not keep the weight off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on weight alone can overshadow other changes that improve &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/health-4159"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; in more reliable and sustainable ways. Some of these may lead to weight loss and some may not, but the benefits are clear either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are five evidence-based resolutions that can support better health – and none are about losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Eat more plants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating more plants does not mean you have to become vegetarian. If you eat meat and want to continue, that is fine. You can still increase the amount and variety of plant foods on your plate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/the-30-plants-a-week-challenge-youll-still-see-gut-health-benefits-even-if-you-dont-meet-this-goal-248491"&gt;The 30-plants-a-week challenge: you’ll still see gut health benefits even if you don’t meet this goal&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is a vast amount of research showing that diets rich in plant foods are linked with lower risks of major diseases. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37789346/"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of more than 2.2 million adults found that consistently sticking to a plant-based dietary pattern was associated with significantly lower risks of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and all-cause mortality (the risk of dying from any cause).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although that study focused on people limiting or avoiding meat, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyw319"&gt;other research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that even among omnivores, each additional 200 g of fruits and vegetables per day is linked with reduced risk of coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, stroke and premature mortality (dying earlier than expected for someone of your age).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding more plants is one of the simplest ways to improve your diet. This includes fruit and vegetables, but also grains, nuts, seeds, herbs, spices and pulses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If exercise were a pill, it would be &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/exercise-is-medicine-and-doctors-are-starting-to-prescribe-it-104390"&gt;prescribed to everyone&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of the most effective things &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/exercise-health-benefits/"&gt;you can do for your health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;iframe class="native-lazy" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5LHWXmeZWl4?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although exercise is often discussed in the context of weight loss, it is not as effective for losing weight as many people assume. Its real value lies in helping to maintain a healthy body weight and supporting overall health.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209525462200103X"&gt;Research has shown&lt;/a&gt; that exercise alone improves several important health markers. It can raise levels of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/DMSO.S67441"&gt;HDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, often called “good cholesterol”, because higher levels help protect against heart disease. It also lowers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2012.671952"&gt;triglycerides&lt;/a&gt;, a type of fat in the blood that increases cardiovascular risk when elevated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise helps the body regulate &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2337/dc19-2523"&gt;blood glucose&lt;/a&gt; more effectively, and it reduces &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.06.019"&gt;arterial stiffness&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the arteries stay more flexible and less prone to the strain that increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. It can also reduce &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2337/dc19-2523"&gt;liver fat&lt;/a&gt;, which lowers the likelihood of developing &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/"&gt;non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt;. All of these improvements can happen even when a person’s weight stays the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, exercise has been shown to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1071/HC11269"&gt;improve fitness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/acm.2019.0050"&gt;quality of life&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1123/jpah.2020-0648"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1123/jpah.2020-0648"&gt;symptoms of depression&lt;/a&gt;. These benefits arise because physical activity boosts blood flow to the brain, releases mood-supporting chemicals such as endorphins and helps regulate circadian rhythms – the internal 24-hour cycles that guide sleep, wakefulness, hormone release and other essential functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best type of exercise is the one you enjoy, because you are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0838.2008.00844.x"&gt;more likely to stick to it&lt;/a&gt;. The benefits come from consistency. Building movement into everyday routines, such as taking the stairs, walking part of your commute or cycling the school run, can be as effective as structured workouts. This also means you do not need an expensive gym membership that might be abandoned by the end of January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These approaches are not possible for everyone, so finding something that fits your circumstances is important. If you are new to exercise, easing in and building up gradually helps reduce the risk of injury and gives your body time to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Stress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is easier said than done, since stress is not usually something we choose. But it can have wide-ranging effects on the body. Long-term stress can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12026-014-8517-0"&gt;weaken the immune system&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-3999(01)00302-6"&gt;raise blood pressure and cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15402000701557383"&gt;disrupt sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also change how we eat. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tem.2009.10.004"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that around 40% of people eat more when stressed, another 40% eat less and about 20% do not change how much they eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of direction, the types of foods chosen often shift towards more pleasurable options &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tem.2009.10.004"&gt;higher in fat and sugar&lt;/a&gt;. Stress has also been linked with eating &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.03.043"&gt;fewer fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at what is driving your stress and seeing whether any part of it can be eased or &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-evidence-based-ways-to-manage-chronic-stress-by-an-expert-in-behavioural-psychology-254333"&gt;managed differently&lt;/a&gt; can have meaningful effects on health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep has a major impact on health. Not getting enough is linked with a range of physical and mental health conditions, including &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0307120"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1001-9294(17)30008-1"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(18)30450-2"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11325-023-02905-1"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adults are usually advised to get around &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need"&gt;seven hours a night&lt;/a&gt;, although this varies from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep also influences diet. Lack of sleep has been linked with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.28523"&gt;increased appetite and food intake&lt;/a&gt;. It also tends to increase preferences for high-energy foods such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5665/sleep.2704"&gt;sweets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2013.114"&gt;fast food&lt;/a&gt;, partly because sleep deprivation disrupts hormones that regulate hunger and craving.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This advice can feel frustrating for people dealing with insomnia or caring responsibilities. But making a realistic plan to improve sleep, where possible, may be a new year resolution that pays off over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alcohol is linked with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(22)00317-6"&gt;long-term risks&lt;/a&gt; such as cancer, heart disease and liver disease. But even in the short term, it can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980020004553"&gt;disrupt sleep&lt;/a&gt; because alcohol changes sleep stages and reduces the amount of restorative deep sleep. Alcohol can also influence &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2010.09.005"&gt;appetite and food choices&lt;/a&gt; by lowering inhibitions and making high-calorie foods seem more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;iframe class="native-lazy" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JNAePTTXN-g?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NHS guidance advises people not to drink &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/alcohol-advice/the-risks-of-drinking-too-much/"&gt;more than 14 units a week&lt;/a&gt; on a regular basis (equivalent to six pints of average-strength beer or 10 small glasses of lower-strength wine) and to have several &lt;a href="https://www.drinkaware.co.uk/news/drink-free-days-your-ultimate-guide"&gt;“drink free days”&lt;/a&gt; per week. This guideline is intended to keep the risk of alcohol-related illness low, but research shows there is &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health"&gt;no completely safe level of drinking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoying a drink now and then is a personal choice. But reducing how much you drink is an evidence-based way to improve health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many new year resolutions focus on weight, yet long-term health is shaped by a much wider set of habits. Small, realistic steps can add up to meaningful improvements in health throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

																			&lt;p class="tagline"&gt;These seated drills torch more belly fat than classic cardio as you age.&lt;/p&gt;
												
																			
																		
						
						
						&lt;p&gt;Do you want to eliminate belly fat? To get started, take a seat, because it’s time to do some &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/chair-exercises-reverse-muscle-aging-after-60/" target="_blank"&gt;chair exercises&lt;/a&gt;. You heard us correctly! &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/chair-exercises-reverse-muscle-aging-after-60/" target="_blank"&gt;Chair workouts&lt;/a&gt; burn extra fat in the abdominal area by boosting your heart rate and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/30-minute-walk-burns-more-calories-than-jogging-after-40/" target="_blank"&gt;burning calories&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll build lean muscle and kick up metabolism. And the good news? Chair exercises are easy on the joints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke with &lt;b&gt;Karen Ann Canham, CEO&lt;/b&gt; and founder of &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="http://www.karenannwellness.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Karen Ann Wellness&lt;/a&gt;, to learn why chair exercises are so beneficial—and the best ones to prioritize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Canham, an invigorating 30-minute Pilates chair workout can burn a significant amount of calories, depending on intensity. While not everyone has access to a Pilates chair, many of these movements can be replicated with a workout bench or a sturdy chair at home. The key is emphasizing slow, controlled movements while stabilizing your body through your sit bones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin sitting sideways on a chair, keeping your right side closest to the back of the chair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place your hands on the chair’s seat or back for support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend your left leg straight out to the side, lifting it a few inches off the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower and repeat on the other side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin seated on a chair, feet planted flat on the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend both arms ahead of you at shoulder height, palms facing in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activate your core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twist your torso to the right, reaching your arms in the same direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to the center.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twist your torso to the left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to twist and reach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin seated on a chair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loop a resistance band under your left foot, holding onto an end with each hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your right foot flat on the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage your core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend your banded leg, pressing your left foot out against the resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use control to return to the start position.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin seated on a chair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain a tall chest and keep your feet on the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activate your core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly lift your right leg a few inches off the floor before lowering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat on the other side.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin seated on a chair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place your hands on the sides of the chair for additional support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain a tall posture with your feet flat on the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift both knees toward your chest. Engage your abs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly lower your feet to the ground.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These apple–peanut butter overnight oats make a satisfying breakfast that you can prep and enjoy throughout the week.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_74-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This French toast casserole is sweetened with banana and a touch of maple syrup.

You can add chocolate chips or chopped nuts for extra flavor if you prefer.

If you can’t find frozen artichoke hearts, you can use canned—just make sure to rinse them well to remove any excess salty brine.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_82-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This fiber-rich chia smoothie is sweet and tangy with a velvety texture, thanks to nutritious chia seeds that expand as they combine with liquid. Chia seeds have plenty of healthy benefits, from delivering a boost of fiber to providing a dose of heart-healthy fats. We like the combination of strawberries, peaches and cherries, but any sweet and tangy fruit combo will work.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_86-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eggs in Purgatory, an Italian favorite, involves gently cooking eggs in tomato sauce (with some regional variations) and can fit neatly into breakfast, lunch or dinner. Our rendition features anchovies for an infusion of savory flavor, and baby spinach to pack in extra veggies. Cracking the eggs in a bowl before you slide them into the pan will ensure that you don’t get unwanted shells in the dish and helps keep the yolks from breaking so they remain soft and runny when they blend with the sauce.

Meanwhile, though, you might hear a confusing stat being tossed around. To be clear: &lt;a href="https://www.al.com/alabamafootball/2025/12/no-alabama-is-not-going-for-its-1000th-all-time-win-in-rose-bowl-vs-indiana.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;As AL.com’s Creg Stephenson reports&lt;/a&gt;, the Tide is NOT playing for its 1,000th all-time victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IATNDR77QBHNTOH42E6NPBTIWE"&gt;Here’s what we think led to the confusion. Sports Reference is a great statistical website that conspires with ADHD to send me down some really twisting, winding rabbit holes. Well, for some reason it lists Alabama games going back only to 1902.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MKILMBG5F5D67BKAJHTHFIUHHY"&gt;As everybody knows, Alabama’s been grinding it out on the gridiron since 1892.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UWRUMV6Q6NAT3BSCDM5K3VP3EY"&gt;So while going back to 1902 you might count 999 wins, if you go back to 1892 you might find the Tide with 1,014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MXPW2CVLPBDJ7IXAJ6SWLZOOFY"&gt;But, according to Creg, that’s probably a little too optimistic. Because that’s not taking into account victories that Alabama has been forced to vacate because of the textbook scandal of around 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4JY7TG5RRZFSPAVDLMO4SUESHM"&gt;To wrap this up, once you take the 999 people have been throwing around, add the wins before 1902 and subtract more recent vacated wins, you get 985 wins heading into today’s game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OIVH5FBCANBT5H6RCEZLJSHJXA"&gt;But, hey, while 986 might not be a neat round number, I’m pretty sure Alabama fans will take it if they can get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="C4KU7RNLIJE2LC27CDZAXZP2IQ"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The presses stop&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PHLYNKIKA5EN3ODVVOMFSDK62E"&gt;The newspaper that covered “Dixie Like the Dew” -- according to its previous masthead motto -- ceased publishing its print newspaper editions at the end of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TOAUGCA3LFGBBAI5JAMV2OQ3MA"&gt;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution -- along with former entities the Atlanta Journal and Atlanta Constitution newspapers -- brought us names such as Furman Bisher, Mark Bradley, Cynthia Tucker, Lewis Grizzard, Doug Marlette, Mike Luckovich and Joel Chandler Harris, a reporter who would go on to create the Uncle Remus character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22" data-gaid="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5PRHY3FBXZFMPEBRGETOKQ4T4A"&gt;Before Margaret Mitchell wrote “Gone With the Wind” she was writing profiles of Civil War figures for the Atlanta Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23" data-gaid="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IWQJI55POVDDJNBWGI5ELY26U4"&gt;For many years, the paper was among the largest and most powerful in the South with a circulation that once hovered above 600,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-24" data-gaid="inarticle-24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="USF2EQTKKFHURN3IE7GZYTTWYU"&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://www.ajc.com/business/2025/08/ajc-to-move-to-fully-digital-publication-phase-out-print-dec-31/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;the AJC has reported&lt;/a&gt; that it’s a digital-only news organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-25" data-gaid="inarticle-25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VR7HFYFIZ5ER3NT73DLPACWG5Q"&gt;If you detect any mournfulness in this voice, then you’re on to something. But, just as when the Alabama newspapers this podcast is affiliated with cut print publication, the sadness is over holding a broadsheet newspaper, grabbing warm copies as they come off the press, smelling the ink (believe it or not) and developing workflows that many of us (forgive my lack of humility) were dang good at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-26" data-gaid="inarticle-26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BYNV6YKDPJD6HPP4ICCBC4MUNQ"&gt;That’s just nostalgia.

He spoke about a patient who, despite having a normal ECG, and stress test insisted on getting a CT Angiography done, because he 'saw it on a podcast.' Dr. Bondre added that the man was asymptomatic, and was simply driven by fear. Here is what a CT Angio is exactly, and why it is not always needed, as revealed by Dr. Bondre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Understanding ECG and Stress Tests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;An electrocardiogram (ECG) tracks the heart's electrical signals during brief periods, to identify abnormal heart rhythms, blockages, and indicators of previous heart injury. A typical ECG result helps doctors to exclude various urgent heart conditions. A stress &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12476583/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; takes this further by challenging your heart with exercise on a treadmill or medication that mimics exercise, while monitoring for reduced blood flow (ischemia) through ECG changes, echocardiogram images of heart wall motion, or nuclear perfusion scans. When these tests come back normal, they predict a very low risk of major heart events, often less than 1% per year in stable patients. The test evaluates heart function through pressure tests to diagnose patients who experience continuous symptoms or need scheduled screenings. The test shows artery structures only when a medical issue appears during the evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Keep your heart young post-30s with these 4 simple ways&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Limits of normal test results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tests provide complete diagnostic results, but do not detect all possible &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12476583/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;conditions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. The system fails to detect 10-20% of important artery blockages, which include non-obstructive plaque that might lead to future complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stress ECG demonstrates sensitivity levels ranging from 47% to 68%, but it does not identify patients who have balanced blockages in multiple arteries, or who cannot perform sufficient exercise. The tests assess heart performance but do not detect the formation of artery plaques. Research shows that atherosclerosis develops in 50% of people who remain asymptomatic during stress tests. However, for patients with a low pretest probability of coronary artery disease (under 15% chance), a negative stress test confirms safety without needing CT Angio in most situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What CT Angio reveals, and its downsides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The imaging technique of CT angiography produces 3D images of coronary arteries through computed tomography scanning and intravenous contrast dye administration, enabling doctors to detect artery narrowing above 50% with 96% accuracy. The test reveals both the amount and specific type of plaque, which doctors use to select appropriate treatment options, including statins for stabilization. The system includes multiple useful elements which make up its structure. The radiation exposure levels span from 5 to 15 millisieverts, which equals 100 to 600 chest X-rays. This increases the risk of developing cancer throughout a person's lifespan, with breast cancer, being the most significant risk for women at 1 in 1,000. Contrast dye used in medical procedures poses two major risks: allergic reactions and kidney damage, especially in patients with existing medical conditions. The test can also produce false negatives, affecting 20–30% of patients who receive incorrect test results, showing abnormal artery function thus leading to unnecessary catheter procedures. Research indicates that 40-60% of these procedures result in negative test outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;When CT Angio is not needed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical team will not perform CT Angio when your ECG and stress test results show no issues, and you belong to a low-risk group for heart problems. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association provide guidelines stating that stable chest pain patients should begin with functional tests, like stress testing before doctors use CT Angio as their secondary diagnostic tool. The PROMISE trial conducted a large study evaluating CT Angio against stress testing for stable patients. It demonstrated that both methods produced equal results for major heart events but CT Angio required an additional invasive test, without providing any additional advantages. The SCOT-HEART trial demonstrated that CT Angio helps decrease the number of events occurring in patients with moderate to high risk, by detecting plaque that needs treatment at its initial stage. The additional radiation and higher costs of screening do not benefit people with low risk factors, because lifestyle modifications such as diet control, exercise and quitting smoking provide superior preventive measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;When CT Angio makes sense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;CT Angio becomes valuable for patients at intermediate or high risk, such as those with atypical chest pain, an abnormal ECG, diabetes, family history of early heart disease, or men over age 50 or women over age 60 with multiple risk factors. The test delivers its best results when stress test results show unclear or unusual patterns because it enables doctors to verify or eliminate blockages through non-invasive procedures before they perform cardiac catheterization. The CT Angio test provides a 94-99% negative predictive value, which enables doctors to confirm the absence of coronary artery disease without performing invasive medical procedures. The test provides essential information for non-heart surgery preoperative evaluation, and for patients who show persistent symptoms even though their functional tests show normal results, because it shows the extent of plaque buildup which standard tests cannot detect.

The most effective method for decision-making involves doctors and patients working together to evaluate pretest probability, age and life expectancy and individual preferences regarding testing. The combination of lifestyle measures which includes heart-healthy eating, physical activity, weight management and risk control produces better long-term prevention results than any scanning method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 11:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgJBVV95cUxNdENFLXF2LXB1Tk56bklkejJMUGJnU0RBR1FhM0NIaklESElWRDBWWDhrMUVWVDA2a0k2aG9WUnhQUXRsRzhueEx3THNlSFRlenpyVnJyV2ZHd3hCME82ZUVOWVI5cDVtdDhaN0htdzlySjcxYll3RXh3RUFKc3NaaTVTZUZkblRoRUhlQkJsQXpULVZ2YWRfSzNYSlBpcWxreEcxak95WnNseHVvNlM0S2duZmYtVElicFdCSDBtRmpQS0NVQ09ZTFlyTGduMnNCMlRqb25OZTVYYXd0QkpGSGQwTE5ZZ3pOUHN4ZnRWN1ZmSE05YTBERHh4TGFzVUxaazFkNWlKU0hhX3lFV1E</guid></item><item><title>流感病例正在上升，新的流感病毒使老年人病情加重-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2026/01/01/flu-season-new-strain/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X7ITMLLOH5DRJIC7UY3NNDAS7Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Cases of influenza in the United States are rising, driven by a new strain that public health officials worry current vaccines may not protect against as effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5DSDNVB2VFFXBMBGDCZTYFKRLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Health officials and researchers say that although the flu season has not reached its peak, the spike in cases is not historically unusual — and they stress vaccines probably still offer protection against the worst effects of the strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 11:31:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE5Za2JxNGxwVWpVd2V6X1pOdHhBaHhreUdHdXRCLTJOOUhndmpYaUhGZkUyV1ppNlRJdGZYWkc5NnJfMDlVN1FaYnpQWDM5QVJwbm9CTFV2ZktTYUZnZzEtYm5sR0ZmUjN3NXlnS2ROWC1CZXJTVmZSOTJxNA</guid></item><item><title>科学家在小鼠研究中将肠道细菌与双相抑郁症联系起来- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-link-gut-bacteria-to-bipolar-depression-in-mouse-study</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Precise changes in the connectivity between neurons caused by an imbalance of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-extra-sense-may-connect-gut-bacteria-with-our-brain"&gt;gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; may help explain &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/good-bacteria-could-be-useful-as-a-treatment-for-depression-study-shows"&gt;depressive symptoms&lt;/a&gt; in bipolar disorder, a new animal study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Zhejiang University in China used fecal transplants to transfer gut bacteria from people with bipolar disorder into mice. The volunteers had all been diagnosed as being in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/bipolar-disorder-linked-to-a-higher-risk-of-early-death-than-smoking"&gt;depressive phase&lt;/a&gt; of bipolar within the last 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a combination of brain imaging, genetic sequencing, and behavioral tests, the scientists determined that the mice began to exhibit signs of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="187215" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; – moving less and showing less interest in treats, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/bipolar-disorder-linked-to-a-higher-risk-of-early-death-than-smoking"&gt;Bipolar Disorder Linked to a Higher Risk of Early Death Than Smoking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, crucial measures of brain connectivity weakened. In the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex"&gt;medial prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt; (mPFC) part of the brain, where a lot of decision making and emotional regulation happens, there were fewer connections (synapses) between cells, and the brain's reward center was effectively cut off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mice transplanted with fecal microbiota from bipolar disorder patients displayed bipolar disorder depression-like behavior, accompanied by changes in neural structure and synaptic connectivity in the mPFC," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03398-y"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animals that received fecal transplants from healthy volunteers showed no such changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the nature of the depression, the researchers used two different medications: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoxetine"&gt;fluoxetine&lt;/a&gt;, which is commonly used to treat major depressive disorder, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/finally-scientists-think-they-know-how-lithium-treats-bipolar-disorder"&gt;lithium&lt;/a&gt;, a first-line therapy used to stabilize moods in conditions such as bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No improvement in mood was seen following fluoxetine, yet treatment with lithium resulted in a significant change in behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matches the treatment response seen in the depressive phases of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/over-60-genetic-links-to-bipolar-disorder-identified-in-largest-study-to-date"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;, as opposed to depression more generally. It's another sign that the gut bacteria switch had effectively brought bipolar depression along with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lithium has been reported to regulate the dopamine system and dopamine neuron firing, which are critical for reward processing," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03398-y"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A further analysis of the gut bacteria transplanted from people with bipolar disorder into mice revealed varieties associated with negative health impacts – including &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella&lt;/em&gt; (already linked to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2024.2333463"&gt;mood disorders&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alistipes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (linked &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2015.03.016"&gt;to depression&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While specific bacterial genera were identified, more evidence is still needed to determine the exact role of [bacteria] in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03398-y"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_187345" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187345" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/FactorsInvolvedinBipolarDisorder-642x356.png" alt="Genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors involved in bipolar disorder." class="wp-image-187345 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/FactorsInvolvedinBipolarDisorder-642x356.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/FactorsInvolvedinBipolarDisorder-1200x666.png 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/FactorsInvolvedinBipolarDisorder-768x426.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/FactorsInvolvedinBipolarDisorder-600x333.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/FactorsInvolvedinBipolarDisorder.png 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-187345" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A wide variety of factors are thought to contribute to bipolar disorder, including the m&lt;span&gt;icrobiota–gut–brain (MGB) axis&lt;/span&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t sound right, does it? After all, for decades we’ve been told that the way to burn off excess calories is simple: move more. Have a slice of cake? No problem, just make up for it at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a major new study challenges that long-standing belief. Collating data on more than 4,200 people across 34 different countries, researchers found that people who exercise more &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; burn more calories than those who sit around all day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the research found that, matched pound-for-pound, a hunter-gatherer from Tanzania’s Hadza community burns about the same number of calories each day as a typical US office worker – even though the Hadza are more active in a single day than most Americans are in an entire week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/10/hazda.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="Hadzabe hunter with bow and arrow" class="wp-image-207850"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The Hadza of Tanzania often walk 8 to 16 kilometres (5 to 10 miles) a day while hunting and foraging – about the same distance most of us cover in a week. Credit: Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some small differences in calorie burn between individuals, but overall they were minimal – and only around 10 per cent could be explained by exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We previously thought that the amount of activity could change the number of calories we burn per day. But what we’ve learned over the past decade or so is that it’s not anywhere near that simple,” says Duke University evolutionary anthropologist &lt;a href="https://globalhealth.duke.edu/people/pontzer-herman"&gt;Prof Herman Pontzer&lt;/a&gt; – one of the 68 scientists behind the new research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, is it time we all chuck out our running shoes and cancel gym memberships? Spoiler: sadly not. While this research suggests ‘how much you move’ has very little bearing on ‘how much you weigh’, giving up on exercise isn't the answer either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metabolism&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;myths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, as the new study suggests, only a sliver of your daily calorie burn comes from exercise, what’s using up the rest? In short: everything your body does behind the scenes to keep you alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your lungs drawing in air, your heart pumping blood, your immune system fighting infections, your gut digesting food, your brain firing with thoughts – all of these processes need energy. A lot of it. In fact, this background work, known as your basal metabolic rate (BMR), accounts for the overwhelming majority of calories you use each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/10/kidneys.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="Cross-section of the kidneys" class="wp-image-207822"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Though they make up less than 1 per cent of your body weight, your kidneys use about 10 per cent of your energy. Photo credit: Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here’s the crucial point: the more cells and mass you have, the more energy you’ll need overall, and the larger your basal metabolic rate will be. It makes sense in theory, but the real-world results are pretty surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namely, thanks to their larger size, the overweight US office worker will generally have a &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; basal metabolic rate than the Hadza hunter-gatherer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People in the developed world burn &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; calories every day than people in farming, foraging and traditional groups,” Pontzer says. “They burn more, because people in the developed world tend to be bigger, and being larger generally means you’re going to burn more calories.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all means that once you account for body size and composition, there’s “hardly any difference” in total energy use between populations around the world, says Pontzer, referring to the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, to put another way, pound-for-pound, the office worker tied to their desk will use a similar number of calories per day as somebody far more active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The calorie equation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could it possibly be that we all burn about the same amount of energy for our body size? According to Pontzer, it’s because when we move more (or less), our bodies don’t simply burn extra calories; our metabolism adapts, conserving energy elsewhere to balance things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, our bodies want to stay in balance (a process biologists call homeostasis). This means that, Pontzer says, if you suddenly decided to cartwheel across a meadow every morning, your body would adapt, shifting its energy resources away from some of those background tasks to accommodate your new exercise habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our bodies are able to adjust to our different lifestyles,” he explains. “If we’re more physically active, our bodies seem to adjust to spend less energy on other stuff. The total calories burned per day is not different, even though we’re more or less physically active.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending fewer calories on other bodily functions may sound alarming, but Pontzer says it’s usually not something to worry about – in fact, it’s desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rejuggling how calories are spent is a really good thing. Most of us spend excess calories on things like background inflammation,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By redirecting energy away from those unnecessary background processes, exercise helps the body run more efficiently – reducing inflammation and keeping us healthier overall. In this way, Pontzer says that while it might not be the key to shedding weight, it’s crucial for maintaining a healthy, balanced body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/10/running-man.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="Smiling middle-aged man dressed sporty in black leggings and blue jacket running through forest full of fallen golden leaves on beautiful autumn day." class="wp-image-207821"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A 5K might feel like extra calories burned, but your metabolism quietly balances the books. Photo credit: Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this effect only goes so far. Suddenly ramping up your activity levels can put strain on your body, causing your immune or reproductive systems to take a hit. You might find yourself getting ill more often, your libido dropping, or your periods stopping altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s called overtraining syndrome,” says Pontzer. “But, unless you’re a professional-level athlete, you’re probably not going to see that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing happens in reverse when you suddenly stop exercising. If you give up your cartwheeling, for instance, your metabolism shifts gears – redirecting that spare energy into background processes like inflammation instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Regardless of how active you are, the body adapts dynamically to keep expenditures within a narrow range,” explains Pontzer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The foods that fuel fat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, according to Pontzer, the real factor associated with body fat percentage isn’t exercise – it’s food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All the weight that we carry is the calories that we ate and never burned off,” Pontzer says. “And so, if our energy expenditures aren’t different, then it must be diet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers found that one type of food stood out as the main culprit behind weight gain. It wasn’t how much meat or other main food groups people ate that explained differences in obesity – it was the amount of ultra-processed food in their diets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These packaged products are made in factories, using industrial ingredients and techniques, and sold in shops. They might include supermarket bread, biscuits, sweets, snacks, colourful cereal, bottled sauces, ready meals, flavoured yoghurts – and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/10/jelly-bean.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="Ultra-processed foods make up about 60 per cent of the average American diet" class="wp-image-207823"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Ultra-processed foods make up about 60 per cent of the average American diet. Photo credit: Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we saw is that, sure enough, across all these groups, the amount of ultra-processed food that these populations are eating is a good predictor of how much body fat they have,” says Pontzer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s correlational, but I think it’s very suggestive that if you eat more ultra-processed food, you’re more likely to be overweight and obese.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the findings are compelling, it’s important to note that the researchers didn’t directly measure what participants ate. There were no food diaries, calorie logs or nutrient breakdowns for either the US office workers or the Hadza members. Instead, the team drew on population-level data from national dietary surveys and global food consumption databases to estimate participants' typical diets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That might sound like nitpicking, but it’s a crucial limitation. Because we can’t see the link between ultra-processed foods, body fat and energy expenditure on an individual level, we can’t be sure &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; ultra-processed foods may lead to obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be that, calorie for calorie, ultra-processed foods have particularly harmful effects. Or – as &lt;a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/adam-collins"&gt;Dr Adam Collins&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of nutrition at the University of Surrey, argues – it might simply be that these foods make it far easier to overconsume calories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not the ultra-processing itself,” he says. “It’s the properties of these foods that make them hyper-palatable, easy to overconsume – as well as the fact that they’re usually energy dense but not very nutritionally dense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/10/UPF-bread.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="Most supermarket bread counts as an ultra-processed food, thanks to the additives and emulsifiers that keep it soft and shelf-stable" class="wp-image-207820"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Most supermarket bread counts as an ultra-processed food, thanks to the additives and emulsifiers that keep it soft and shelf-stable. Photo credit: Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By definition, ultra-processed foods are designed to be as delicious as possible, which means they tend to be high in salt, fat and sugar, low in fibre and nutrients, and easy to eat quickly and in large portions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When people say they’re going to cut out all their ultra-processed food, what happens?” says Collins. “People end up eating less. People are more mindful of what they’re eating. They end up losing weight and becoming healthier.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He adds: “It's not that we've got to cut out all ultra-processed foods, or that every ultra-processed food is bad.” Instead, we might benefit from consuming them more mindfully and in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chewing the fat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study, however, isn’t without its critics – Collins among them. In particular, he argues that exercise does play more of a role in weight loss than it’s given credit for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s true that exercise might not burn off many calories directly. And tracking ‘calories in versus calories out’ – this thinking of ‘I’ll just run off that chocolate bar’ – is outdated,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But exercise can help regulate appetite and change body composition, reducing body fat and increasing muscle mass.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Collins points out, muscle cells are more metabolically active than fat cells, meaning that building more muscle subtly raises your daily energy needs and overall calorie burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/10/smart-watch.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="Woman checking fitness tracker during workout at gym" class="wp-image-207824"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Your smartwatch might say you’ve ‘burned off’ that snack, but according to Pontzer, your body simply burns less elsewhere to stay in balance. Photo credit: Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pontzer agrees that exercise can change body composition, which in turn affects metabolism – but he says these are “really small, marginal changes,” and that exercise programmes relying on them for weight loss generally don’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collins, however, remains unconvinced. He calls Pontzer’s model “a neat idea,” but says it’s still unproven – and that long-term studies following individuals over their lifetimes are needed to truly test it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why you still need exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite disagreements over how effective exercise is for fat loss, one thing everyone agrees on is that it’s incredibly good for us. It strengthens the heart, protects bones, keeps metabolism in check and boosts mental wellbeing – helping us live longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pontzer is hoping that health advice about weight will change – but he’s not advocating that people abandon exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rather than blaming both diet and physical activity equally, which is how it’s all framed right now, I hope that we can focus entirely on diet for the obesity crisis, because that seems to be the main driver here,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t mean that we should stop exercising or stop telling people to exercise. Those are important goals as well – but we really need to focus our efforts on diet.”&lt;/p&gt;

The well established advice meant to keep you healthy also protects others by reducing the spread of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Get a Flu Shot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“The single best way to reduce the risk of seasonal flu and its potentially serious complications is to get vaccinated each year,” &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevention/actions-prevent-flu.html"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Many health professionals, including infectious disease specialist Steven Gordon, MD, and infectious disease clinical pharmacist Kaitlyn Rivard, PharmD, both at the Cleveland Clinic, say the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/when-to-get-flu-shot"&gt;best time to get vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; is in September or October, when new annual versions of the vaccines typically become available in North America. But don't worry if you missed that window, because the second best time is “now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Elena Diskin and Lisa Sollot, two respiratory specialists at the Virginia Department of Health, and Christy Gray, the director of the Division of Immunization there, all agree that there's still time to get the annual flu vaccine. “The season runs from October through the end of April,” they wrote in an email, adding “we typically see the most flu activity in January and February.” So yes, it's still worthwhile to get a flu shot if you haven't had one yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Flu Vaccines Cannot Give You the Flu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;While it's possible to feel unwell after getting a flu vaccine, you cannot get the flu from it. In &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevention/misconceptions.html"&gt;public health information about flu vaccines&lt;/a&gt; last updated in 2024, the CDC confirms that, “Flu vaccines cannot cause flu illness. Flu vaccines given with a needle (i.e., flu shots) are made with either inactivated (killed) viruses, or with only a single protein from an influenza virus.” The &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/now-you-can-get-your-flu-vaccine-at-home/"&gt;nasal spray vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, which is for people between the ages of 2 and 49, and which you may be able to administer at home, “contains live viruses that are attenuated (weakened) so that they will not cause illness,” according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;After receiving a vaccine, it takes up to two weeks for it to have its full effect, however. That means if you were exposed to the flu virus either right before or up to two weeks after receiving the vaccine, you could get sick, but it wouldn't be due to the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Flu Vaccines Are Highly Effective at Preventing Severe Illness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The flu vaccine changes every year based on which strains of the virus experts think will be prevalent, and while it's not foolproof, it is highly effective at preventing severe illness. In the 2024-2025 season, for example, flu vaccines were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-vaccines-work/php/effectiveness-studies/index.html"&gt;56 percent effective&lt;/a&gt;, which is higher than it had been in almost 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Vaccine effectiveness is measured by comparing the frequency of health outcomes (e.g., symptomatic illness, hospitalization, death) in vaccinated and unvaccinated people in the real world,” say Diskin, Solot, and Gray at the Virginia Department of Health. &lt;em&gt;Effectiveness&lt;/em&gt; is different from &lt;em&gt;efficacy&lt;/em&gt;, which measures outcomes in controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“In plain language, [vaccine effectiveness] describes how much less likely a vaccinated person is to get sick compared to an unvaccinated person, based on real-world data,” says Sai Paritala, an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Public Health and former epidemiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>wired.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1oT3pNQ3F5Z3c2OGFoX2pDM2ZiOGp4M0xZUXA3TWp2eEx5WU9nd01ZblJqWWFybWVNQW5mNEEzVUlZNUs2ZXlBaUJUN3F4V016c3dyeFp0cUw2TmRMVDd5aERUQXVzcWE5M2toUGwyeXI4VzF5bVE</guid></item><item><title>“看着我受苦数周” ：女子在室友的秘密测试后出现过敏反应-无聊的熊猫</title><link>https://www.boredpanda.com/roommate-puts-grass-pillow-prove-woman-wasnt-allergic/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You can’t truly know someone until you start living with them, even if you are convinced that they are your best friends. Sharing a home has a funny way of showing sides of people you never noticed before — maybe they leave their towel on the bathroom floor, or leave dirty dishes in the sink for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman thought she was in for an adventure when she decided to move in with her four best friends, but the reality of living together was nothing like she had imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ps31o6/aio_that_i_moved_out_after_my_exroommate_admitted/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; to see if she had overreacted, she shared that she had suffered weeks of cruel behavior before she finally decided to move out. And it wasn’t even the usual roommate annoyances where you can set boundaries and move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her roommates had been deliberately triggering her allergies, and she had been waking up every morning with “red, itchy and swollen eyes,” completely unaware of what was causing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What followed was shock and disbelief as she realized that the people she had trusted the most had been causing her pain all along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Living with friends isn’t always as easy as it sounds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woman sneezing into tissue in bed surrounded by used

rel="nofollow"&gt;Fun-Character-7614&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Signs of trouble started showing up long before&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before the whole “stuffing grass in the pillow” incident, the Reddit user had already started experiencing problems with her roommates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a previous post, she shared that the same friends had been pressuring her almost every week to mow the lawn. This was despite everyone agreeing before moving in that she was allergic and would be excused from this task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also mentioned that the tension wasn’t just about chores — there had been other moments where her roommates regularly dismissed her concerns or pushed her boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_desktop_post_4" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Small red flags often lead to bigger problems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is hard to set boundaries with someone you consider a close friend when you are sharing the same space, especially if you are trying to hold onto the bond at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say ignoring red flags or failing to set boundaries since the very beginning can slowly lead to tension and leave issues unresolved for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, conflict is bound to happen when you live with someone and it is important to face it directly rather than pushing things under the carpet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Misunderstandings arise when we assume we know the reasons for another person’s behavior. And often we do not. That’s why communication is so important,” &lt;a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/so-hoos-asking-how-can-i-get-along-my-first-year-roommate" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Adrienne Wood&lt;/a&gt;, a social psychologist and professor, was quoted by University of Virginia Today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists also say that negative roommate relationships can severely impact one’s mental and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.jphsc.org/index.php/JPHSC/onlinefirst/download/35/13" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that people felt more anxious, had trouble sleeping, and found it hard to focus when they didn’t feel safe or comfortable in their own house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when nothing seems to work, whether it’s communication or establishing ground rules, the only option — experts say — is to move out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes our fundamental needs and values conflict with those of our roommates, in which case there may be no way around it but to transition to a new living situation,” Brooke Sprowl, an LA-based therapist, was quoted by &lt;a

    &lt;p&gt;But walking doesn’t have to be a workout. The key thing is to walk to enjoy it. Even a 30 minute stroll is significant in terms of daily movement. Often, people do their workouts but forget their daily steps – it’s moving throughout the day that really makes the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;6. Hop, skip, jump&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thought of jumping horrifies some people, but explosive movement – combining strength and power – can be one of the best things you can do for yourself. Whether it’s hops, skips, jumps, or shuttle runs (think, galloping sideways) if you leave the ground, you have to land – and that impact puts stress on our muscle which pulls on the bone, and that ‘good’ stress stimulates new bone cell growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to be careful if you’re at risk of osteoporosis, or concerned about injury – but there are low impact options – a mini-trampoline or rebounder. Or simple heel raises. Or step ups on the stairs. You don’t have to do jump squats or burpees. Some people tick the box with running, but it can be detrimental to joints. I do a lot of skaters. They’re brilliant, because you’re working on single leg strength which is key. You’re jumping laterally on one leg, and landing, so you’re using your explosive power, and focusing on your balance and core. I love any single leg exercise – single leg squats, single leg deadlifts – working on your stability is so important, especially as you get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;7. Be consistent, and know how to motivate yourself&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often say, “It’s alright for you, you love exercise! How do I start?” I say, “Try to give exercise six weeks. In two weeks you’ll start to feel different. In four weeks you start to see a difference, and in six weeks it almost becomes a habit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistency is everything – so find something you actually enjoy. If you hate running, Couch to 5K is not for you. In midlife, it’s about training smarter, not harder and longer. Set small goals. My workouts are half an hour – they’re effective and tough. Research has shown that short workouts work, you don’t have to hit it hard for an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of staying motivated is to not overdo it. I love running, but I’m not pounding the pavements every morning. I do a little 5K loop of Battersea Park once a week, and I come back buzzing. My advice is to exercise in the morning, first thing, before the day takes over. Set your alarm ten minutes earlier. Lay out your kit the night before. Know what you’re doing. Have the class downloaded or booked, or arrange to exercise with a friend. Clear all mental obstacles. You don’t need to be perfect, you need to stick at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout January we will be publishing a four-part workout, starting with a ten-minute full-body circuit today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Workout 1: Full Body Power&lt;/h2&gt;

(Pexels)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nutritionist Deepshikha Jain took to Instagram on January 1 to recommend good habits that can help you achieve your health goals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Stack fridge with healthy food&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The first habit she recommended is to “clean out your fridge, remove all the junk and stack it up with more fruits, vegetables and whole fruits.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is high time you stop treating the fridge just as a storage space, as clean eating begins from here, by eliminating the clutter. Deepshika also highlighted the importance of whole foods. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;While one may consider protein and packaged ‘healthy’ foods, there is nothing inherently wrong with them; it is just better to rely on fresh and minimally processed foods as much as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Run more&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deephika recommended running more as a way to achieve mental clarity. A &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/how-a-10-minutes-run-can-boost-brain-processing-a-study-finds-out-101640497359028.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in 2021 shared that even 10 minutes of moderate-intensity running contributes towards activating parts of the brain responsible for regulating mood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Eat more pre and postbiotics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third suggestion from the nutritionist was to include foods that support gut health. According to her, this means adding prebiotics and probiotics, as maintaining gut health should be a priority. In a previous HT Lifestyle &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/nutritionist-shares-surprising-probiotic-prebiotic-foods-in-indian-kitchens-apart-from-dahi-tangy-kanji-to-paneer-101751012364004.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="interview"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;, IIMS and ICMR-trainer Pariksha Rao, Director - nutrition and medical affairs, The Good Bug, listed paneer, idli, dosa, chaas, pickles, kanji, dhokla, green peas, beetroot, apples, and whole wheat bread as the probiotic sources. Probiotics are live bacteria which ensure a healthy balance in the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Journal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good health also extends to mental well-being as physical and psychological systems are intricately interconnected. Deepshika recommended journaling every day as a way to better process and manage emotions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Sleep early&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;To counter the high stress levels and the resultant increase in cortisol in the body, which can trigger inflammation and lead to many health issues over time.&lt;/span&gt; Imbalance in cortisol levels is an underlying cause for many ailments. Deepshika suggested sleeping early to help balance cortisol levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Walk at least 10,000 steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying active is one of the fundamental pillars of achieving health goals. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Daily movement is the bare minimum, which is why the nutritionist recommended getting at least 10,000 steps a day to reduce the risks of many metabolic diseases.&lt;/span&gt; Shazia Shadab, Lead Physiotherapist at Cloudnine Group of Hospitals, Bangalore, Jayanagar, in a previous HT Lifestyle &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/take-a-walk-outdoor-day-10-benefits-of-walking-every-day-ways-to-increase-your-daily-steps-101705649322954.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="interview"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; from January 2024, listed benefits like: improved circulation, improved blood pressure, better weight management, lower stress, better digestion, energy levels and immunity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Eat healthy fats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nutritionist recommended starting the day with fats. This includes nuts and seeds such as walnuts and chia seeds, as well as foods like eggs, which are rich sources of good fats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Protein-rich meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The next diet-related recommendation from the nutritionist is to ensure that meals contain more protein, as this macronutrient is essential for various body functions, including improved muscle strength and better appetite control.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Lift more weights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, consider taking your workout to the next level, especially if you tend to stick to onlycardio. For long-term health and longevity, Deepshika highlighted the benefits of incorporating weight training into your routine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. Write your goals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, the nutritionist advised writing down your goals every day. This practice acts as a driving force toward achieving them. It also sharpens the commitment towards those goals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.
