              &lt;p&gt;Dr. Sofiya Milman spends her days studying some of the longest-living people on the planet — humans who are living proof that it's possible to live decades past the average American lifespan of 75 to 80 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What she's learned so far — about lifestyle but particularly about DNA — is opening up avenues that could lead to a new era of antiaging treatments for the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have people who live to 100 and are healthy, so our bodies are capable. It's biologically plausible, therefore we just have to tweak things to get us there," she told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milman, the director of human longevity studies at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, is leading a study to recruit 10,000 people&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;age 95 and older, along with their relatives, to find out what makes them live longer and healthier lives than their peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These so-called "super-agers" may owe their long lives to luck and good genes, but studying them could help scientists give the rest of us a biological edge, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then we can have a drug that will benefit the other 99.9% of the population that didn't win the genetic lottery and wasn't lucky enough to inherit that gene," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, don't get sidetracked by common misconceptions about living longer. Here's what Milman said really works (and doesn't) for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="f7ed5ebb-8b1b-461d-b67a-5164193184c0" data-toc-id="f7ed5ebb-8b1b-461d-b67a-5164193184c0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aging isn't inevitable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we can't control the passage of time, medications and treatments could help us delay, prevent, or even reverse the process of getting older, at least in the sense of becoming frail or ill over time, Milman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People do not recognize the fact that there is a biology that drives aging and that you can actually manipulate that biology," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already have medications to treat conditions including high blood pressure and high cholesterol — some of them, such as statins, have &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tips-tricks-longevity-expert-reduced-longevity-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;antiaging benefits&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors may one day have even more treatments for age-related decline, and sooner than you may think. Milman is hopeful that we'll start to see viable options in the next decade or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really not science fiction anymore," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="e5bb9ea1-b2b2-447f-bc5b-76d43f02e1a8" data-toc-id="e5bb9ea1-b2b2-447f-bc5b-76d43f02e1a8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthspan is more important than lifespan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By age 65, a majority of Americans have at least one chronic illness such as arthritis, diabetes, cognitive decline, or cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/section&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;No one wants to live to 100 if they can't get out of bed or engage with the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think most people would argue the more important thing here is healthspan. How many years of healthy life free of chronic conditions do you have?" Milman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Super-agers are a perfect example of an &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-doctor-reversed-biological-age-15-years-eats-avoids-mediterranean-2025-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;ideal healthspan&lt;/a&gt;, able to stave off dementia, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer for 10 or even 20 years later than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're not only living longer, they're actually living healthier," Milman said — and that can hold lessons for the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5eecc020-c429-4e04-a4c1-c22bd8475f7b" data-toc-id="5eecc020-c429-4e04-a4c1-c22bd8475f7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot of centenarians drink alcohol and snack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many ways, centenarians are just like the rest of the population, even when it comes to unhealthy lifestyle habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They drink same amount of alcohol, they exercise the same, no less, no more, they're just as likely to be overweight. They're not less likely to smoke. And so there isn't a lifestyle feature that we can say, well, if you do that, then you'll live to be a hundred," Milman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factors such as genetics, and even good luck, seem to play a big role in getting people over the 100-year mark, more than any specific &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/advice-live-longer-centenarians-luck-2025-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;centenarian habits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milman said studying centenarians had been a poignant reminder to herself about focusing on the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/8-simple-habits-add-decades-onto-to-your-life-research-2023-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;little habits&lt;/a&gt; that can make a big difference for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the time being, I need to be doing everything that has been shown to help us live longer and healthier, so exercising, eating a healthy diet, reducing stress in my life, and getting enough sleep," Milman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2a18eb7b-fc16-4104-b2b7-36d1d0d7c5ac" data-toc-id="2a18eb7b-fc16-4104-b2b7-36d1d0d7c5ac"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular exercise is really important&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before you skip your workout or have an extra glass of whiskey, Milman said healthy habits might be even more important if you aren't lucky enough to be naturally long-living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lifestyle is important for 99.9% of us who don't have longevity genes. So there's indisputable evidence that leading the healthy lifestyle will allow you to live longer," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While science may not guarantee you'll live to 100, you can &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/plant-based-mediterranean-diet-add-ten-years-longevity-modeling-study-2022-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;add years to your life&lt;/a&gt; with habits such as eating a diet high in nutrient-dense whole foods including produce, nuts and seeds, and high-quality protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you're going to prioritize only one habit for living longer and healthier, it should be exercise, Milman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting enough physical activity will give you more bang for your buck in terms of health benefits, she said, and the best kind of exercise is one you'll do consistently, whether that's walking with friends or lifting weights in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;

Ishak-Adib, with 30 years of experience, notes a dramatic rise in pediatric cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="4f3ou-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4f3ou-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4f3ou-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;"I never saw this in my early career," she says. "Now, it’s common — even in children without excess weight. Among obese children, up to 40% develop fatty liver disease. I currently treat five- and eight-year-olds with the condition, something unheard of in the past. It used to be rare to diagnose a 15-year-old with fatty liver disease, but today it's routine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="8bc3k-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="8bc3k-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="8bc3k-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Modern diets high in processed foods, saturated fats, sugary drinks and red or processed meats, alongside a decline in physical activity, contribute significantly to the rise in fatty liver disease among children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="7bhmk-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="89emb-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="89emb-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="89emb-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;"Western diets are overloaded with processed foods and unhealthy fats, while intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes and whole grains remains low," Ishach-Adiv explains. "It’s not just about what we eat—it’s also about what we don’t do. Kids today move less than ever. A sedentary lifestyle, with excessive screen time and little physical activity, directly impacts energy balance."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="398eq-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="398eq-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="398eq-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Although genetics can play a role, it is not the primary cause. "Some cases stem from genetic disorders, but these are rare," she says. Furthermore, even children with normal or low BMI can develop the condition if they have insulin resistance, high blood lipid levels or a genetic predisposition.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="6e9k1-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6e9k1-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6e9k1-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Fatty liver disease is often called a "silent disease" because it typically has no noticeable symptoms. "A child or adult can have fatty liver disease without realizing it," Ishach-Adiv says. "It develops quietly and doesn’t cause discomfort until complications arise."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="2d7aj-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="2d7aj-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2d7aj-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The condition is often detected through routine checkups, particularly in overweight children or those with unexplained symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="6uqgk-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="45no4-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="45no4-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="45no4-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;"Ultrasounds combined with blood tests can reveal fatty infiltration in the liver. Elevated liver enzymes in blood tests may also signal the disease," she says. "Sometimes, children are diagnosed after being examined for unrelated stomach pain." Early detection is crucial, as lifestyle changes can prevent irreversible damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="eton8-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="eton8-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="eton8-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Fatty liver disease isn’t a life sentence — it’s a warning sign. "I tell families that this is an opportunity to make changes before it’s too late," Ishach-Adiv stressed. "It’s a chance to adjust not only the child’s habits but the entire family’s. Many times, siblings and parents also adopt healthier lifestyles."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="983th-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="983th-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="983th-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The primary treatment isn’t medication but dietary and lifestyle modifications. "Some children with severe obesity or metabolic syndrome may receive weight-loss treatments and there are options for adults. However, the best long-term solution remains a healthy diet and regular physical activity," she says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="4djce-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4djce-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4djce-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Dietary recommendations include shifting from processed foods to a more natural, Mediterranean-style diet rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes and whole grains. "Reducing animal fats, avoiding preservatives and artificial colors and prioritizing plant-based fats significantly improve liver function in children," she explains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="6h017-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dhghp" data-offset-key="3uu0p-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3uu0p-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3uu0p-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The earlier the intervention, the easier it is to maintain healthy habits. "Convincing a 15-year-old to stop drinking chocolate milk and eat healthily is challenging," Dr. Ishach-Adiv says.

&lt;p&gt;A Michigan resident died of rabies contracted from an organ they were donated, state health officials said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The unidentified patient died in January, a month after getting the transplant at a hospital in Ohio, Lynn Sutfin, a spokesperson for Michigan’s Department of Health and Human Services told The Post on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A public health investigation determined they contracted rabies through the transplanted organ,” Sutfin said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health officials have not identified the recipient or said what type of organ transplant they received.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health departments in both Michigan and Ohio “worked closely” together with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the investigation into the patient’s death, Sutfin told the outlet. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis was also confirmed by the CDC’s Rabies Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Health officials worked together to ensure that people, including health care providers, who were in contact with the Michigan individual were assessed for possible exposure to rabies,” Sutfin said in a statement. “Post-exposure preventive care, if appropriate, has been provided.”&lt;/p&gt;

No tunnel, white light, etc. Just saw the truck coming at me, and then I was in the hospital.

When I was in the hospital half-alive, I went between blackness and a white-grey haze. I felt no pain, even though I had both my femurs broken. One was a compound fracture with the bone through my leg. The blackness that soon overtook me felt like a void.

I actually don't recall what I felt very well. I know I was angry. I realized I was going to die, but I didn't want to accept it. All I recall after falling through the ice was anger. It felt like forever, just punching the ice. I couldn't find the hole I fell in from either. It was so cold, the coldest I've ever been. Right as things were greying out, I tried one more time. I pushed off the ice to go down. I found a rock, or maybe it was a stick. I can't remember. I hit the ice a few more times before it broke. Walking back for nearly an hour in the cold and snow and in wet clothes probably almost killed me too, in hindsight. The whole experience and the month afterward of being sick in bed are a blur.

I got caught in the current and couldn't swim out, nor could I grab something to hang onto. I couldn't hold my breath any longer, so death began to sink in once my mouth was full of water. The natural instinct is to open your mouth for air, but it mind-fucked me knowing all I was gonna get was water. At some point, I see someone dive underwater near me and pull me out. It was my cousin who had to walk me back to the rest of the party with my family. I was in a daze for the rest of the day. My dad freaked the fuck out if I remember correctly.

I lost 24 hours of my life because I succumbed to anemia. Before I passed out, I was fighting to stay awake with all my might. Then, a sense of both utter peace and utter calm came over me. Even at that tender age, I knew that day would be my last, and I accepted it. Then, I wake up in a hospital with one burning question, 'Is this heaven?' The strangest thing about coming from a nearly dead state to breathing is it changes a person. You experience utter peace. Then, like a flick of the light switch, you're out."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Witthaya Prasongsin / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2qmt72/serious_nsfw_redditors_who_have_been_on_the_brink/cn7ufrm/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:_Duyassene_;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;_Duyassene_&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;10.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Tunnel vision then blacked out from blood loss.

I was told I was trying to gap a table top on my board, and the back wheels came up short. If others hadn't been there, I probably would have died. All I can remember was I was standing. Then, the next very vague memory I had, I was in an ambulance. Supposedly, I never went unconscious.

I decided to take a long run-up from the end of the street. I got the speedometer on my bicycle up to 30 mph right before I hit the ramp. In the air, I screwed up, though. I leaned too far forward and went over the handlebars. I landed head-first on the concrete and slid about 10 feet. The last thing I remember before it all went black was seeing the ground in front of my bike. I woke up in the hospital six hours later. I'm not sure about the specifics, but I remember being told I flatlined. They had to bring me back in the ambulance. I came out of it with a serious concussion, no skin on my face, and a lot of pain."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I don't remember anything between it going black and waking up. It was not like sleeping. It's like a scene change on TV. One moment, I was there. The next moment, I was in hospital. Not darkness, not a feeling. Just...nothing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2qmt72/serious_nsfw_redditors_who_have_been_on_the_brink/cn7pjta/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dmenzie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dmenzie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;13.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Suffering from preeclampsia at 32 weeks pregnant, I had a C-section to deliver my twin boys. They were sent to the NICU while I stayed in the hospital with high blood pressure. Three days later, I awoke and found it difficult to breathe. I summoned the nurse to the room. My breathing grew more and more difficult. What sounded like a raging river swirled in my head. As more and more people entered my hospital room, I hoped someone was going to be able to help me. I realized I was going to die. I felt peaceful but extremely sad that I wasn't going to be in my children's lives. I thought about how strange it was that it didn't hurt that I couldn't breathe. Then I collapsed. I awoke the next day on a ventilator in an ICU in a different hospital. I was told I had suffered heart failure and had six liters of fluid removed from my lungs. l ended up in the ICU for nine days, then transferred back to the women's hospital where my babies were."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; SerrNovik / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"My nurse, who had been on duty the night I had heart failure, came to see me and told me I had been completely gray and unresponsive until intubated. Eventually, my sons and I were all released from the hospital. The thing that stayed with me was the feeling I had not actually survived. It took me well over a year to realize I was alive. It was a very strange feeling of floating through life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2qmt72/serious_nsfw_redditors_who_have_been_on_the_brink/cn7v55p/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Walker-mama;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Walker-mama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;14.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"When I was six, I had a tonsillectomy due to an unknown bleeding disorder. I had bleeding spells but nothing serious until right before Christmas. We were out cutting a tree when my throat collapsed, and I began to throw up buckets of blood. So much that they couldn't empty them fast enough. I remember my mom holding me and crying as my eyes rolled back in my head. Everything went black, and then a piercing light and warmth washed over me. My last words were, 'It's OK, Mom. Don't worry. It's nice here. They're going to keep me safe until I get back.' I was flown in a medivac chopper to Little Rock, Arkansas. At some point, I was clinically dead and then on a respirator for just over a month."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Honestly, other than the last thing I spoke and the warmth from the light, I don't remember anything until the pain from the catheter they put in after the respirator. I definitely would like to have stayed unconscious for it. The hospital staff treated me awesome, and I got my picture in the paper as the 'Christmas miracle kid.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2qmt72/serious_nsfw_redditors_who_have_been_on_the_brink/cn7xue0/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rawbcrum;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;rawbcrum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;15.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, "I was working inside a manhole, and I was wearing a harness connected to a safety rope. The person performing the hole watch tied me to a truck when he got called to another part of the work site. (I assume so that the rope wouldn't fall in the hole.) The truck started to drive off with me tied to it. I screamed for help while I was pulled straight up to the top of the manhole opening. As the harness was getting tighter and tighter, I breathed out, but I couldn't breathe in as the harness got tighter. It was like being bear-hugged by a very strong person. I remember feeling very calm and thinking, 'This is how it ends,' before the truck stopped and backed up. Then the slack let in, and I fell 15 feet to the bottom of the sump.

Lauren Leffer, who recently &lt;a href="/science/632605/forever-war-with-bird-flu"&gt;wrote a piece for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about bird flu&lt;/a&gt; and how it’s becoming a forever war, is joining me on the show, and we’re going to talk about the systems, structure, and culture that might control bird flu — and those that might make it worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;You’ve most likely heard about bird flu in the context of egg prices. Eggs are expensive and hard to find right now because the bird flu has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/business/egg-prices-restaurants.html"&gt;kicked off an old fashioned supply and demand problem&lt;/a&gt;: the virus kills almost every single chicken it infects; fewer chickens means fewer eggs, and fewer eggs means higher prices. You’ll hear Lauren say &lt;a href="https://www.levernews.com/animal-farm-eggflations-monopoly-problem/"&gt;it’s a little more complicated than that&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s the basic shape of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;But the bird flu is actually quite a bit more serious than just the egg supply. The first &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/health/bird-flu-death-louisiana.html"&gt;confirmed human death linked to the virus&lt;/a&gt; happened in January. Now, we’re facing some uncomfortable questions with no easy answers. Like how rapidly the new strains of bird flu, known collectively as H5N1, might be spreading from birds to dairy cows and other animals, as well as just how deadly those new strains are among both birds and mammals, including human beings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;If you’re like me, you’re starting to feel some uncomfortably familiar feelings, and you’re not wrong to feel them. There are some real echoes of COVID-19 here — and the Trump administration, with Robert Kennedy Jr. as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services, is not at all equipped to handle a fast-moving pathogenic virus. Kennedy himself is an anti-vaccine activist who peddles junk science with abandon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Just last week, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html"&gt;Kennedy went on &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and suggested one way to deal with ongoing bird flu outbreaks was to simply let it spread and kill all the birds, which is a purely stupid idea for a variety of reasons you’ll hear Lauren discuss. Certainly not helping the matter is that on Thursday, just a few days after Lauren and I talked for this episode, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/us/politics/health-department-job-layoffs-rfk-jr.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a major workforce reduction of HHS, with layoffs hitting 10,000 employees in a move Kennedy said would a “a painful period” for the department that would involve doing “more with less.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;On top of all that, the messy aftermath of the pandemic and the damage done to institutional trust across the board would make the job difficult for even a credible leader of our public health services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;But like I said, I wanted to talk about this in a &lt;em&gt;Decoder &lt;/em&gt;framework, and there’s one big difference from COVID-19 that I wanted to push on here: industrial agriculture in the US is a big business, and the bird flu is a threat to that business. Millions of dead birds represent millions in lost revenue, and if the virus becomes more deadly to dairy cows, that’s even more money on the line. So if the government isn’t capable of mounting a response, is the industry capable of seeing and solving this problem before it becomes even worse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;The answer, as you might expect, is a resounding question mark, but as you’ll hear Lauren explain, different parts of the market are reacting differently. And right now, there still appears to be time: scientists are not yet raising the kinds of alarms that we started to see in the months leading up to March 2020, when covid changed all of our lives forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;But one thing is very clear: the bird flu is not just going to go away, no matter how much Kennedy might wish that was how it worked. We need to learn how to live with it and manage it. And so long as we can get everyone on the same page, we might even be able to fight it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;If you’d like to read more on what we talked about in this episode, check out the links below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _1o279nj1 _1o279nj0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1ymtmqpi _11h7yix0 _1xwtict1"&gt;&lt;li class="_11h7yix1"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;We’ve entered a forever war with bird flu | &lt;a href="/science/632605/forever-war-with-bird-flu"&gt;Verge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_11h7yix1"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Kennedy’s alarming prescription for bird flu on poultry farms | &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html"&gt;NYT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_11h7yix1"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;First bird flu death in US reported in Louisiana | &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/06/health/bird-flu-death-louisiana.html"&gt;NYT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_11h7yix1"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Bird flu found in sheep in UK, a world first | &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/europe/bird-flu-sheep-england.html"&gt;NYT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_11h7yix1"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Shell shocked: how small eateries are dealing with record egg prices | &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/business/egg-prices-restaurants.html"&gt;NYT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_11h7yix1"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Animal Farm: eggflation’s monopoly problem | &lt;a href="https://www.levernews.com/animal-farm-eggflations-monopoly-problem/"&gt;The Lever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_11h7yix1"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;At the ‘Wall Street of Eggs,’ Demand Is Surging | &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/egg-industry-prices-shortage-clearinghouse-54435e03"&gt;WSJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_11h7yix1"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;How to protect your pets from bird flu | &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/health/how-to-protect-your-pets-from-bird-flu/"&gt;Popular Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_11h7yix1"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What to know about the bird flu outbreak in wild birds | &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-outbreak-wild-birds-7d49613331851a33c6cda41a96035959"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_11h7yix1"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Bird flu continues to spread as Trump experts are MIA | &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/bird-flu-continues-spread-as-trumps-pandemic-experts-are-mia/"&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Questions or comments about this episode?

This loss of reward dampens the desire for high-calorie foods, potentially worsening obesity by promoting habitual, joyless eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice, restoring neurotensin levels reversed this effect, improving weight control and eating behavior. The findings highlight a brain mechanism behind obesity and open new avenues for targeted treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurotensin’s Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Obesity is linked to reduced neurotensin in brain regions tied to food reward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restored Motivation:&lt;/strong&gt; Reinstating neurotensin in obese mice revived food enjoyment and normalized eating patterns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting neurotensin pathways may lead to precise, side-effect-free obesity treatments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The pleasure we get from eating junk food — the dopamine rush from crunching down on salty, greasy French fries and a luscious burger — is often blamed as the cause of overeating and rising obesity rates in our society.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a new study by scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, suggests that pleasure in eating, even eating junk food, is key for maintaining a healthy weight in a society that abounds with cheap, high-fat food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108262"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and junk food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/obesity-food-enjoyment-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers then tested ways to restore neurotensin levels. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, anecdotal evidence suggests that people with obesity may take less pleasure in eating than those of normal weight. Brain scans of obese individuals show reduced activity in pleasure-related brain regions when presented with food, a pattern also observed in animal studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, UC Berkeley researchers have identified a possible underlying cause of this phenomenon — a decline in neurotensin, a brain peptide that interacts with the dopamine network — and a potential strategy to restore pleasure in eating in a way that helps reduce overall consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study reveals an unsuspected brain mechanism that explains why a chronic high-fat diet can reduce the desire for high-fat, sugary foods, even when these foods remain easily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers propose that this lack of desire in obese individuals is due to a loss of pleasure in eating caused by long-term consumption of high-calorie foods. Losing this pleasure may actually contribute to the progression of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A natural inclination toward junk food is not inherently bad — but losing it could further exacerbate obesity,” said Stephan Lammel, a UC Berkeley professor in the Department of Neuroscience and a member of the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that this effect is driven by a reduction in neurotensin in a specific brain region that connects to the dopamine network. Importantly, they demonstrate that restoring neurotensin levels — either through dietary changes or genetic manipulations that enhance neurotensin production — can reinstate the pleasure in eating and promote weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A high-fat diet changes the brain, leading to lower neurotensin levels, which in turn alters how we eat and respond to these foods,” Lammel said. “We found a way to restore the desire for high-calorie foods, which may actually help with weight management.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While findings in mice don’t always translate directly to humans, this discovery could open new avenues for addressing obesity by restoring food-related pleasure and breaking unhealthy eating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Imagine eating an amazing dessert at a great restaurant in Paris — you experience a burst of dopamine and happiness,” said Neta Gazit Shimoni, a UC Berkeley postdoctoral fellow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that this same feeling occurs in mice on a normal diet, but is missing in those on a high-fat diet. They may keep eating out of habit or boredom, rather than genuine enjoyment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gazit Shimoni and former UC Berkeley graduate student Amanda Tose are co-first authors, and Lammel is senior author of the study, which will be published March 26 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solving a long-standing puzzle in obesity research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, doctors and researchers have struggled to understand and treat obesity, as countless fad diets and eating regimens have failed to produce long-term results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent success of GLP-1 agonists like Ozempic, which curb appetite by increasing feelings of fullness, stands out among many failed approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lammel studies brain circuits, particularly the dopamine network, which plays a crucial role in reward and motivation. Dopamine is often associated with pleasure, reinforcing our desire to seek rewarding experiences, such as consuming high-calorie foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While raising mice on a high-fat diet, Gazit Shimoni noticed a striking paradox: While in their home cages, these mice strongly preferred high-fat chow, which contained 60% fat, over normal chow with only 4% fat, leading them to gain excessive weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when they were taken out of their home cages and given free access to high-calorie treats such as butter, peanut butter, jelly or chocolate, they showed much less desire to indulge than normal-diet mice, which immediately ate everything they were offered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you give a normal, regular-diet mouse the chance, they will immediately eat these foods,” Gazit Shimoni said. “We only see this paradoxical attenuation of feeding motivation happening in mice on a high-fat diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She discovered that this effect had been reported in past studies, but no one had followed up to find out why, and how the effect connects to the obesity phenotype observed in these mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restoring neurotensin reverses obesity-related brain changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this phenomenon, Lammel and his team used optogenetics, a technique that allows scientists to control brain circuits with light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that in normal-diet mice, stimulating a brain circuit that connects to the dopamine network increased their desire to eat high-calorie foods, but in obese mice, the same stimulation had no effect, suggesting that something must have changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason, they discovered, was that neurotensin was reduced so much in obese mice that it prevented dopamine from triggering the usual pleasure response to high-calorie foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Neurotensin is this missing link,” Lammel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Normally, it enhances dopamine activity to drive reward and motivation. But in high-fat diet mice, neurotensin is downregulated, and they lose the strong desire to consume high-calorie foods — even when easily available.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then tested ways to restore neurotensin levels. When obese mice were switched back to a normal diet for two weeks, their neurotensin levels returned to normal, dopamine function was restored, and they regained interest in high-calorie foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When neurotensin levels were artificially restored using a genetic approach, the mice not only lost weight, but also showed reduced anxiety and improved mobility. Their feeding behavior also normalized, with increased motivation for high-calorie foods and a simultaneous reduction of their total food consumption in their home cages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bringing back neurotensin seems to be very, very critical for preventing the loss of desire to consume high-calorie foods,” Lammel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t make you immune to getting obese again, but it would help to control eating behavior, to bring it back to normal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward more precise treatments for obesity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although directly administering neurotensin could theoretically restore feeding motivation in obese individuals, neurotensin acts on many brain areas, raising the risk of unwanted side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome this, the researchers used gene sequencing, a technique that allowed them to identify specific genes and molecular pathways that regulate neurotensin function in obese mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery provides crucial molecular targets for future obesity treatments, paving the way for more precise therapies that could selectively enhance neurotensin function without broad systemic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now have the full genetic profile of these neurons and how they change with high-fat diets,” Lammel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next step is to explore pathways upstream and downstream of neurotensin to find precise therapeutic targets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lammel and Gazit Shimoni plan to expand their research to explore neurotensin’s role beyond obesity, investigating its involvement in diabetes and eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The bigger question is whether these systems interact across different conditions,” Gazit Shimoni said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How does starvation affect dopamine circuits? What happens in eating disorders? These are the questions we’re looking at next.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other co-authors are Charlotte Seng, Tamás Lukacsovich and Csaba Földy of the University of Zurich in Switzerland; Yihan Jin and Lin Tian of UC Davis; Hongbin Yang of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China; Jeroen Verharen, Christine Liu, Michael Tanios, Eric Hu, Jonathan Read and Lilly Tang of UC Berkeley; and Byung Kook Lim of UC San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The work was supported by the McKnight Foundation, One Mind Foundation, Weill Neurohub, Rita Allen Foundation, Wayne and Gladys Valley Foundation and National Institutes of Health (R01DA042889, U01NS120820, U01NS113295, R01NS121231, R01DA049787).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shimoni was supported by a Young Investigator Award from the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this obesity and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#92e0fee1f3fcf6f7e0e1d2f0f7e0f9f7fef7ebbcf7f6e7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Robert Sanders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Robert Sanders – UC Berkeley&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08748-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Changes in neurotensin signalling drive hedonic devaluation in obesity&lt;/a&gt;” by Stephan Lammel et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes in neurotensin signalling drive hedonic devaluation in obesity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calorie-rich foods, particularly those that are high in fat and sugar, evoke pleasure in both humans and animals. However, prolonged consumption of such foods may reduce their hedonic value, potentially contributing to obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we investigated this phenomenon in mice on a chronic high-fat diet (HFD). Although these mice preferred high-fat food over regular chow in their home cages, they showed reduced interest in calorie-rich foods in a no-effort setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paradoxical decrease in hedonic feeding has been reported previously, but its neurobiological basis remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that in mice on regular diet, neurons in the lateral nucleus accumbens (NAcLat) projecting to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) encoded hedonic feeding behaviours. In HFD mice, this behaviour was reduced and uncoupled from neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optogenetic stimulation of the NAcLat→VTA pathway increased hedonic feeding in mice on regular diet but not in HFD mice, though this behaviour was restored when HFD mice returned to a regular diet. HFD mice exhibited reduced neurotensin expression and release in the NAcLat→VTA pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, neurotensin knockout in the NAcLat and neurotensin receptor blockade in the VTA each abolished optogenetically induced hedonic feeding behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhancing neurotensin signalling via overexpression normalized aspects of diet-induced obesity, including weight gain and hedonic feeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, our findings identify a neural circuit mechanism that links the devaluation of hedonic foods with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 13:57:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBFNlR4UlZ5SjNsclBBUkl0VkFsME1IUGJDckh2YmxSdzl3c1pfdnBGRjJic3JtTGc5eFUzcDk4UjIyWkhhSGxhcFNYVjNQSDdmZ0wwN0NYWUx5anVnV2JuQk1IQU1vZUNZVzhNeE5JNlVTQTY4</guid></item><item><title>Type 2 Diabetes Rewires the Brain Like Early Alzheimer’s - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE84eElEblVSeHRtNDVUTHBObGhWSUZyODVXdzBmcUd1dXN5bndoTXVFcjVlQlRwMjluQlVhOEtyOU04RWpMdjBhc0NHcGlJenNnY3J3Q19laE9oQXZhV2V2RUdOTkdfRWkwRHpsaXpISQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research reveals that Type 2 diabetes may impair the brain’s reward and memory processing in ways that mirror early Alzheimer’s disease. The study focuses on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a brain region responsible for motivation and emotional regulation, and its interaction with the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In diabetic rodent models, researchers observed muted reward signals and impaired memory processing linked to elevated blood sugar levels. These changes may help explain the elevated Alzheimer’s risk in people with diabetes and point to new avenues for early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impaired ACC Function:&lt;/strong&gt; Type 2 diabetes weakens reward and memory signals in the anterior cingulate cortex.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link to Alzheimer’s:&lt;/strong&gt; The disrupted ACC-hippocampus connection mimics early Alzheimer’s cognitive changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Treatment Target:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings highlight this brain circuit as a new avenue for interventions in diabetes and mood disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Nevada&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type 2 diabetes may rewire the brain in ways that mimic early Alzheimer’s disease — and UNLV researchers say the &lt;em&gt;“why”&lt;/em&gt; may lie in a previously unexplored connection between high blood sugar levels and a key part of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes is a group of diseases characterized by an imbalance of blood sugar or insulin levels. Scientists have long known that Type 2 diabetes patients are more prone to psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. The risk of developing Alzheimer’s is 65% higher in diabetics. But the exact link between diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases has been poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108254"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/diabetes-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The research team called their findings significant, given the importance of diet and lifestyle interventions to manage diabetes. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UNLV research team went searching for answers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on their findings, published this week in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;’s Computational Properties of the Prefrontal Cortex Special Collection, it appears that diabetes weakens ACC function — suppressing reward perception and memory signals — and induces mild cognitive impairment similar to that observed during the brain’s progression towards Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diabetes may be altering the brain similarly to early stages of Alzheimer’s disease,” said lead researcher and UNLV psychology professor James Hyman. “Further research is needed but these findings have the potential to help researchers unlock clues to improved diagnostic or treatment strategies for the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study builds on the UNLV team’s previous research into the link between diabetes and Alzheimer’s, and represents the first time scientists have looked for clues within the ACC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACC is associated with fundamental cognitive processes — ranging from motivation, decision making, and learning to goal-oriented behavior (such as tracking tasks and experiences over time), pleasure seeking, and reward processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACC’s role in regulating emotions also makes it integral to brain patterns observed in patients experiencing mood disorders and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To gain insight into the interplay between the ACC and high blood sugar levels, scientists observed brain activity and behavior in rodent models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that diabetics’ anticipation of a reward, such as a sweet treat, is heightened in comparison to healthy brains. Additionally, after receiving the reward, healthy-brained subjects pause to savor, while the diabetics quickly move on to the next reward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to scientists, hyperglycemic insulin levels appeared to impair the ACC’s information-processing ability surrounding rewards. The researchers pinpointed the weakened reward signal to a dampened input into the ACC from another key brain area for Alzheimer’s disease called the hippocampus, which is involved in spatial and autobiographical memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think the hippocampus tells the subject where it is location-wise, and the ACC tells the subject what it is doing and that it’s getting a reward,” Hyman said. “These things should come together and make the subject remember it was just in a special, rewarding location, but this doesn’t happen with the ones that have Type 2 diabetes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team called their findings significant, given the importance of diet and lifestyle interventions to manage diabetes. Globally, 1 in 10 people contend with the illness, and 90% of cases are Type 2 diabetes — which is linked to obesity and can lead to chronic damage to nerves, blood vessels, and surrounding tissues and organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, study authors said, the hippocampus-to-ACC projection may be worth exploring as a treatment target for mood disorders to which the ACC is already linked. Hyman said his team’s research reveals direct evidence of muted reward processing and behaviors that are consistent with anhedonia, or the inability to experience pleasure — a common symptom of depression and Type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, he said, the circuit between the ACC and hippocampus is integrally important during the early stages of Alzheimer’s pathology. His team plans to continue its investigation into the connection between the neurodegenerative disorder and weakened ACC function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alzheimer’s disease goes undetected for decades because our brains are good at finding ways to compensate. Before diagnosis, people behave normally despite having changes in information processing.

T2D is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia, loss of insulin signaling, neuroinflammation, and increased morbidity and mortality chances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand the functional effects of T2D on ACC information processing, we delivered an intermittent, low dose streptozotocin (STZ) protocol to rats (all male due to female insensitivity to STZ) which led to lasting hyperglycemia and recorded single neurons during a delayed alternation task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observed changes in spatial and reward processing in spite of no differences in overall behavioral accuracy, though we did find hyperglycemic animals spent less time at the reward site. Hyperglycemic animal (n=5) ACC neurons had higher spatial information scores and changes in the allotment of spatial coding assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the hyperglycemic group had greatest spatial information during the reward approach, while in controls (n=3) it was uniformly distributed. We found that state space separation and decoding accuracy were greater in control ensembles at the reward location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, control hippocampal theta phase-locked cells had the strongest reward coding and this effect was absent in hyperglycemic animals, leading to a muted reward representation, despite increased reward approach coding. T2D inferred a nuanced and layered effect on ACC activity, leading to reward coding deficits and a differential change in spatial coding properties.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 13:17:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE84eElEblVSeHRtNDVUTHBObGhWSUZyODVXdzBmcUd1dXN5bndoTXVFcjVlQlRwMjluQlVhOEtyOU04RWpMdjBhc0NHcGlJenNnY3J3Q19laE9oQXZhV2V2RUdOTkdfRWkwRHpsaXpISQ</guid></item><item><title>Experts reveal the best milk for your body... and the favorite pushed by RFK Jr could be deadly - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPM0VWTWpkalpQS29lN1M5OXFFbzMtMi1rTnhJcV9CWjJta0NIRFc3Y0t5YkFVTU50MVE1WkNFVU5SZlJkZGNYcms0T3dXYlRscl8xendhcnB3bXBNa1FDSUlZZ3R6c1dVN1dhb3l1dzB6d21RVV9HZzctVWh1aEx3OXR0dzJteHFNVFpSMmJsSzFsdnZrVl9mWXRlM2FmWVhEQmZGNUVWQWg0QdIBrwFBVV95cUxNeTZidFhLc3BOWlo1aE9HYlVoNWxIYjJINTRXczJPb3BjR3NaSTZ2OWNHYUQ3bEhuV3lsNHdnc3FMWGpIenVUOEJjdlN4NU5DVW9YTERfRmNaYkNtUVQzTFR2QS14MXF2eFF5cklnSlRCMVZOMFFIZnN0bEplUVF5Sjl6MlBGMUpweTNJRUQ3dXlzWkJIdFVrd242bmFnQkMzQ215YWpoWi1fY242Ry1V?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Navigating the ever-expanding selection of milk and dairy alternatives can leave your head spinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Traditional cow’s milk, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-10205161/New-studies-suggest-dairy-actually-GOOD-help-prevent-disease.html"&gt;a dietary staple&lt;/a&gt; for thousands of years, has fallen out of fashion, surpassed by trendy oat and nut milks, which have legions of wellness-minded and lactose-intolerant followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are dozens of types of animal- and plant-based milks to choose from, but &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12147359/From-cows-oat-soya-almond-dietician-reveals-milk-really-best-health.html"&gt;not all are created equally&lt;/a&gt;, with each affecting the body - and planet - differently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some, like almond milk, have high levels of bone-strengthening calcium but use an excess amount of water to make, while others, such as oat milk, cause a spike in blood sugar but have a very low environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, the newest milk trend is unpasteurized -or raw milk. Pasteurization involves heating raw milk to kill off bacteria that can cause harm, such as &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/e-coli/index.html" id="mol-a1320040-0a77-11f0-a887-330375410b2e"&gt;E. coli&lt;/a&gt;, salmonella, and listeria, resulting in the safer-to-drink milk lining grocery store shelves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But raw milk, which as been promoted by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, does not underdo this process and poses a severe health risk as it can be contaminated with dangerous pathogens.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultimately, dietician Maya Feller &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://goop.com/wellness/health/which-milk-is-best-for-your-body-and-the-planet/"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;Goop the best way to choose which milk to buy is up to the individual consumer, who knows their health best. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Below, DailyMail.com breaks down the ins and outs of the most popular milks on the market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There are dozens of types of animal- and plant-based milks to choose from, but not all are created equally, with each affecting the body differently&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="wellness-ccox"&gt;Cow’s milk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Milk Classic. As far as types of milk go, it’s the most nutrient-dense, offering up a healthy dose of protein – around eight grams per one eight-ounce glass – about 30 percent of daily calcium needs, as well as phosphorus, and vitamin B2, which help strengthen bones and provide energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Milk has long been associated with strong, healthy bones. It was the bedrock of the mega-popular Got Milk campaign in the '90s and early 2000s, featuring the cast of Friends, Simpsons characters, and the Williams’ sisters with prominent milk mustaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Got Milk campaign has become an indelible piece of American pop culture, solidifying milk as a foundational part of a healthy diet and making it a kitchen staple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes in several forms - whole, reduced fat, low-fat and fat-free, also called skim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in Poland linked it with a lower risk of bone density loss in old age. They &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3738995/"&gt;reported &lt;/a&gt;that consuming dairy products regularly during preschool and school years was linked to a higher probability of having better bone mineral density as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the high protein content, in addition to helping you feel fuller, is a major benefit for bone health. A 2013 study in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/association-of-total-protein-intake-with-bone-mineral-density-and-bone-loss-in-men-and-women-from-the-framingham-offspring-study/F56B457B9D540CFCB088C1F2313ACB61"&gt;Public Health Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; found women who ate a high-protein diet were more likely to have a healthy bone mineral density than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cow’s milk also contains potassium and magnesium, which help &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.115.002787"&gt;protect against stroke&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it’s not all good news. Like many foods, there are benefits and drawbacks to traditional cow’s milk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High dairy intake has been linked with an increased likelihood of dying from &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/367/bmj.l6204.long"&gt;heart disease and cancer&lt;/a&gt; - so this type of milk is best consumed in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Harvard University physicians found that drinking a lot of skim or low-fat milk was associated with a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/367/bmj.l6204.long"&gt;slightly higher risk of death&lt;/a&gt; from all causes and poor cardiovascular health, as well as lung cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite its benefits, cow's milk isn't for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 30 and 50 million Americans have some degree of intolerance for lactose, the type of sugar found in milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with lactose intolerance do not make enough of the enzyme lactase, which is needed to digest milk sugars. Luckily, however, the alternative milk market has exploded in the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The latest buzz is about raw, unpasteurized milk. Pasteurization heats milk to kill harmful bacteria like E. coli, salmonella, and listeria, making store-bought milk safer to drink&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A rising star in the milk market is raw milk, the unpasteurized, bacteria-laden version of common cow's milk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Through his Make American Health Again initiative, RFK Jr has revived public appetite for raw milk, which can carry potentially deadly bacteria, particularly among those more willing to seek alternative and natural medicines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite studies and real-world case reports pointing to the dangers of drinking raw milk, RFK has slammed the FDA for what he sees as 'aggressive suppression... of raw milk' as part of the agency's 'war on public health.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Silvia Caswell, associate program director of the preventive medicine residency program at Loma Linda University, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.llu.edu/health-wellness/raw-milk-%C2%AD%E2%80%93-why-experts-say-you-shouldnt-drink-it#:~:text=Despite%20the%20benefits%20of%20pasteurization,and%20Salmonella%2C%22%20Caswell%20said."&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: 'Raw milk can expose individuals to harmful germs such as Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, E. coli, Listeria, and Salmonella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is no substantial evidence to support claims that raw milk can cure or alleviate [certain] conditions. Many of the studies cited are often misinterpreted or taken out of context.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pasteurizing milk involves heating it to 161 degrees for about 15 seconds, which kills off Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria, Campylobacter, and other harmful bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC which has long &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-13422095/raw-milk-sales-bird-flu-immunity-myth.html"&gt;warned against drinking raw milk&lt;/a&gt;, said: 'Since the early 1900s, pasteurization has greatly reduced milk-borne illnesses.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency has recorded &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/food/buy-store-serve-safe-food/dangers-raw-milk-unpasteurized-milk-can-pose-serious-health-risk"&gt;more than 200 disease outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; linked to drinking raw milk from 1998 through 2018, which caused 2,645 illnesses, 228 hospitalizations and three deaths.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="wellness-ccox"&gt;Soy milk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From the crowded field of plant-based milks to choose from, soy milk comes out as the option with the highest nutrient density per eight ounce serving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soybeans are a protein powerhouse packing six grams and at least 20 percent of your daily value of calcium and B12. It is considered a complete protein, meaning it contains all the essential amino acids that humans need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Caswell said: 'Soy milk fortified with calcium, vitamin A and vitamin D is an excellent alternative because it is nutritionally comparable to regular milk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, soy milk has been clouded in controversy recently due to some of its ingredients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://foodprint.org/real-food/soy-milk/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20USDA%2C%20nearly,only%2017%20percent%20in%201997."&gt;Nearly 100 percent&lt;/a&gt; of all soy acreage planted on US land is genetically modified to resist herbicides and pesticides. That’s up from 17 percent in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some are concerned about the impact this has on their health, though there has not been any conclusive evidence pointing to harm or a decline in nutritional value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soy is generally heart-healthy and good for blood vessels. A 2020 study in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.119.041306"&gt;Circulation &lt;/a&gt;showed American men and women who ate the highest amounts of tofu and isoflavones from soy foods had an 18 percent and 13 percent lower risk, respectively, of developing heart disease compared with those who ate the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study did not look at soy milk specifically, though the results are noteworthy given that soy milk contains those same isoflavones.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another sticking point for soy is its association with a higher breast cancer risk. Isoflavones in soy are a type of plant estrogen known as phytoestrogen, which functions similarly to human estrogen, but with weaker effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tara Scott, an OB/GYN and hormone specialist, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hormoneguru/video/6984210455661137158?lang=en"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: '[With] soy milk, you do have to worry about the quality of the soy and the fact that it can be a phytoestrogen.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because estrogen is known to play a role in the genesis of breast cancers, there has been a long stream of debate and research into the question of whether consuming phytoestrogens exacerbates that risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But phytoestrogens don’t always mimic estrogen. Sometimes they block the action of the hormone, meaning drinking soy milk could, in theory, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/98/7/459/2522023"&gt;reduce the risk of breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2021, researchers in China found eating soy could stave off death due to breast cancer. They studied 1,460 early-stage breast cancer survivors’ intake of isoflavone in soy before and after their diagnosis over a four-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking or eating high amounts of soy was associated with a 66 percent lower risk of death from any cause and a 64 percent lower risk of death from breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Higher soy intake after the breast cancer diagnosis was associated with a 64 percent and 51 percent lower risk of death from any cause and breast cancer, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="wellness-ccox"&gt;Oat milk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There is now a wide selection of oat milk and other plant-based beverages on the market&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oat milk is the milk of the moment, but it’s also the one most likely to cause a spike in blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Biochemist Jessie Inchauspé said in a viral interview on the drink: ‘Oat milk comes from oats, oats are a grain, and grains are starch. So, when you’re drinking oat milk, you’re drinking starch juice. You’re drinking juice with a lot of glucose in it – so it leads to a big glucose spike.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In people without diabetes, the increase in blood glucose most likely is not worrisome enough to warrant skipping your oat milk latte, but it could be concerning for people with the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oat milk is low in protein compared to dairy and soy milk, though higher in fiber and lower in fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nutrition experts point out it’s worth paying close attention to the ingredients label, which should have only list a few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Companies are also likely to add gums and flavors, which cut in to the already shaky nutritional foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many popular oat milks on the market &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ehn.org/glyphosate-free-oat-milk-2659999493.html"&gt;also contain glyphosate&lt;/a&gt;, which is the active ingredient in heavy duty weed killer RoundUp. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some experts believe late-season spraying of pesticides on crops in the field is to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dora Marinova, a professor of sustainability at the Curtin University Sustainability Policy Institute, told Goop: 'Oat milk is really good in terms of its environmental footprint—very, very low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Yet it’s grown as a monoculture, which makes it vulnerable to all kinds of bugs and pests. Therefore, we see increased use of pesticides, including glyphosate, which essentially have potentially toxic implications.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="wellness-ccox"&gt;Almond milk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almond milk is the top-selling plant-based milk in the US, yet it has the weakest nutritional profile compared to the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ninety-seven percent of it is water, and one eight-ounce serving of almond milk has just one gram of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reading the label on the back of the carton is always a good idea, as some brands of almond milk are higher in sugar than cow’s milk. They’re also often loaded up with thickeners and flavoring that, like oat milk, may undercut the benefit of drinking it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unsweetened varieties of almond milk are typically low carb, and many brands enrich theirs with vitamins, minerals, and added protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almond milk is also naturally rich in vitamin E, a powerful antioxidant with links to reducing risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="wellness-ccox"&gt;Rice milk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rice milk is lower in calories than dairy milk and is gluten-free, making it a safe bet for people with celiac disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s also cholesterol-free and has only one gram of fat per cup, which works well for people on diets specifically tailored for keeping the heart healthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its low fat and calorie content also make it a good option for someone looking to lose a few pounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A typical serving has fewer calories than a glass of cow’s milk but it still has more than a cup of soy milk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A major drawback, though, is the drink’s high glycemic index. One cup of rice milk contains 33 grams of carbohydrates, three to four times the amount in cow's milk or soy milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The naturally high carb content means diabetics should steer clear.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="wellness-ccox"&gt;Coconut milk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Coconut milk, not to be confused with coconut water, comes from the flesh of mature brown coconuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It supplies the body with more magnesium than traditional cow’s milk and packs about 40 percent of the daily recommended allowance of iron in a single cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, coconut milk contains about half the protein of a glass of cow’s milk and more than four times the calories, but no cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The coconut has a high glycemic index (GI), which means it’s likely to cause a spike in blood sugar after eating it and diabetics may need to find another plant-based milk alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it’s not all bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While GI is high, coconut milk has a low glycemic load, a measure that takes into account glycemic index and the portion eaten. A low glycemic load means it has very little impact on blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 13:06:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPM0VWTWpkalpQS29lN1M5OXFFbzMtMi1rTnhJcV9CWjJta0NIRFc3Y0t5YkFVTU50MVE1WkNFVU5SZlJkZGNYcms0T3dXYlRscl8xendhcnB3bXBNa1FDSUlZZ3R6c1dVN1dhb3l1dzB6d21RVV9HZzctVWh1aEx3OXR0dzJteHFNVFpSMmJsSzFsdnZrVl9mWXRlM2FmWVhEQmZGNUVWQWg0QdIBrwFBVV95cUxNeTZidFhLc3BOWlo1aE9HYlVoNWxIYjJINTRXczJPb3BjR3NaSTZ2OWNHYUQ3bEhuV3lsNHdnc3FMWGpIenVUOEJjdlN4NU5DVW9YTERfRmNaYkNtUVQzTFR2QS14MXF2eFF5cklnSlRCMVZOMFFIZnN0bEplUVF5Sjl6MlBGMUpweTNJRUQ3dXlzWkJIdFVrd242bmFnQkMzQ215YWpoWi1fY242Ry1V</guid></item><item><title>Dementia may not always be the threat it is now.

We also have data from other countries as well, that again, reassures us that vaccines are not associated with autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because there is already so much data on this topic, Marnik said it’s a waste of resources to even do this study.

A new study reveals that two neuron types in the nucleus accumbens—D1 and D2 neurons—respond together to both rewarding and aversive stimuli, but in distinct ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using real-time imaging in mice, researchers found that D2 neurons are especially important for updating learned associations, such as recognizing when a threat is no longer dangerous. These insights could help explain why people with anxiety or PTSD struggle to let go of negative memories and may lead to targeted treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D1 and D2 Neurons:&lt;/strong&gt; Both neuron types respond to rewards and threats but have different roles in learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D2’s Role in Extinction:&lt;/strong&gt; D2 neurons help extinguish negative associations when a stimulus is no longer aversive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Health Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding D2 function may inform new therapies for anxiety and PTSD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;BIAL Foundation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The human brain contains billions of neurons that continuously receive information and stimuli from the outside. To make decisions, neurons assess at every moment whether the stimulus is positive or negative. If it is positive, there is a tendency to approach, while if it is negative, an aversion reaction arises, which helps to ensure survival. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nucleus accumbens (NAc) of the brain plays a central role in the process of evaluating and coding stimuli, but how the D1 and D2 neuronal populations of the NAc encode appetitive or aversive stimuli is still not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108250"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman and a brain scan." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-danger-reward-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When associations change, such as when a negative stimulus no longer has an unpleasant consequence, the D2 neurons are essential for extinguishing that aversive association. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To deepen knowledge in this area, a team of researchers coordinated by Ana João Rodrigues and Carina Soares-Cunha (ICVS, U.Minho), with the support of the BIAL Foundation, studied the D1 and D2 neurons of the NAc to understand how they distinguish between stimuli and influence learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By tracking hundreds of neurons in mice exposed to appetitive and aversive stimuli in real-time, the researchers demonstrated for the first time that D1 and D2 responded together to both stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the article Dynamic representation of appetitive and aversive stimuli in nucleus accumbens shell D1- and D2-medium spiny neurons, published in the scientific journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers reveal that using advanced imaging in mice, they were able to observe that during associative learning, i.e. when a stimulus is associated with a reward or punishment, both types of neurons are activated and work together, but they do so differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When associations change, such as when a negative stimulus no longer has an unpleasant consequence, the D2 neurons are essential for extinguishing that aversive association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since difficulties in modifying negative associations are linked to anxiety and post-traumatic stress, better understanding the function of D2 neurons could help develop new treatments”, explains Carina Soares-Cunha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The same external stimulus can provoke different reactions depending on the individual’s context and memories. For example, the sound of fireworks can evoke celebrations and joy. Still, for a former combatant, it can trigger an anxiety crisis, bringing back memories of war, even if he is in a safe environment”, she exemplifies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates the brain’s ability to constantly reclassify external stimuli based on previous experiences and adapt to new situations while simultaneously proving the complexity of the neuronal circuits involved in this type of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was developed in partnership with Rui Costa and Gabriela Martins from Columbia University and the Allen Institute (USA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;In addition to the BIAL Foundation, the research was co-funded by the European Research Council, the la Caixa Foundation, and the Foundation for Science and Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2350424d4751420d534a4d574c63414a424f454c564d4742574a4c4d0d404c4e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sandra Pinto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://bialfoundation.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BIAL Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sandra Pinto – BIAL Foundation&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-55269-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dynamic representation of appetitive and aversive stimuli in nucleus accumbens shell D1- and D2-medium spiny neurons&lt;/a&gt;” by Carina Soares-Cunha et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic representation of appetitive and aversive stimuli in nucleus accumbens shell D1- and D2-medium spiny neurons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key brain region for motivated behaviors, yet how distinct neuronal populations encode appetitive or aversive stimuli remains undetermined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using microendoscopic calcium imaging in mice, we tracked NAc shell D1- or D2-medium spiny neurons’ (MSNs) activity during exposure to stimuli of opposing valence and associative learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite drift in individual neurons’ coding, both D1- and D2-population activity was sufficient to discriminate opposing valence unconditioned stimuli, but not predictive cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, D1- and D2-MSNs were similarly co-recruited during appetitive and aversive conditioning, supporting a concurrent role in associative learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, when contingencies changed, there was an asymmetric response in the NAc, with more pronounced changes in the activity of D2-MSNs. Optogenetic manipulation of D2-MSNs provided causal evidence of the necessity of this population in the extinction of aversive associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results reveal how NAc shell neurons encode valence, Pavlovian associations and their extinction, and unveil mechanisms underlying motivated behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 12:48:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE00VWtHTjFrWlVsV1k5RlA3ckF3Q0FNOFRsNnFBU1Z6SlZjRkp0T041YVpxR3B2TFh6MDR3X2FVZnhxQkl4TzFGc1dwSXJydnk2UmhJRmg4RDc3emlqbTVkVGZpalotMjJfY1dqUXgwYw</guid></item><item><title>How Often You Go to the Bathroom Could Reveal Hidden Health Risks, New Study Says - The Daily Galaxy --Great Discoveries Channel</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxNamRnTHpmZGc4SGw3X1hKQVBqeHJRVG1tNkFmVFJVd3JkSDA4dXp3LWo4Rk9tdWtOdzlzekZpVEpMcVZYQm9kRlR3TkJGT1JLcE5SaU5yLUM3MWlEdXIxMnNVZW5YUjBqeDk0NDJ0UkxpRmtJOG14YnIzeEcwTE9fU0xkRTVUZ19TbmVXRk5ISTViaUtjdDZBUEdVM0RyOFhNby1HRVZPSHAzbkpacjI1bVk0cw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t give much thought to their bathroom schedule. But according to new research, &lt;strong&gt;how often you go&lt;/strong&gt; could be a strong indicator of your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00360-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study published in Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has revealed a striking &lt;strong&gt;link&lt;/strong&gt; between bowel movement frequency and long-term physiological well-being. Researchers found that people who have one to two bowel movements per day tend to show healthier biological markers than those who go more or less often.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What Your Poop Schedule Is Telling You&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by &lt;em&gt;Sean Gibbons&lt;/em&gt; at the &lt;strong&gt;Institute for Systems Biology&lt;/strong&gt;, analyzed data from over 1,400 healthy adults. These participants weren’t just surveyed — they provided stool and blood samples, underwent gut microbiome analysis, and filled out detailed lifestyle and diet questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;They were then divided into four groups: those with &lt;strong&gt;constipation&lt;/strong&gt; (1–2 bowel movements per week), &lt;strong&gt;low-normal&lt;/strong&gt; (3–6 per week), &lt;strong&gt;high-normal&lt;/strong&gt; (1–3 per day), and &lt;strong&gt;diarrhea&lt;/strong&gt; (more than 3 per day).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s what they discovered: people with constipation had &lt;strong&gt;higher levels of toxins&lt;/strong&gt; like &lt;em&gt;p-cresol sulfate&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;indoxyl sulfate&lt;/em&gt; in their blood. These compounds are produced when gut bacteria shift from fermenting fiber to breaking down proteins — a process that can put significant strain on the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Problem with Both Extremes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, participants who experienced frequent diarrhea had clinical signs of inflammation and possible liver damage. According to the researchers, “the body excretes excessive bile acid” during diarrhea, which is usually recycled by the liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;That means the organ has to work harder to compensate, disrupting fat absorption and &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/one-simple-change-key-preventing-dementia/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="76113" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;overall metabolic function&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast, people who fell into the “&lt;strong&gt;Goldilocks zone&lt;/strong&gt;” — with one or two bowel movements a day — had gut microbiomes rich in &lt;strong&gt;strict anaerobes&lt;/strong&gt;, a type of bacteria associated with good health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Diet Connection Is Crystal Clear&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also wanted to know what lifestyle habits were most common among the healthiest group. The biggest indicator? Diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; “It was eating more fruit and vegetables, that was the biggest signal we saw,” Gibbons said. These individuals were also more likely to &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/09/why-its-urgent-to-stop-drinking-bottled-water/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="12088" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;drink water regularly&lt;/a&gt;, stay physically active, and lean toward plant-based meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the data also showed that &lt;strong&gt;younger people, women&lt;/strong&gt;, and those with &lt;strong&gt;lower body mass indexes&lt;/strong&gt; were more likely to have less frequent bowel movements. Hormonal and neurological differences, as well as lower food intake, may explain these patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Moving Toward Prevention Through the Gut&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications of this research are big. “I do hope that this work will kind of open clinicians’ minds a bit to the potential risks of not managing bowel movement frequencies,” Gibbons noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors have traditionally seen irregular bowel movements as more of a discomfort than a medical concern. But this study suggests they could be an overlooked factor in &lt;strong&gt;chronic disease prevention&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The next step, according to the researchers, is to launch a &lt;strong&gt;long-term clinical trial&lt;/strong&gt; that tracks health outcomes based on managed bowel movement frequency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Hidden Health Signal Hiding in Plain Sight&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t realize how much their gut routine could reflect deeper health dynamics. But this study makes one thing clear: bowel movement frequency isn’t just about comfort — it’s about &lt;strong&gt;systemic health&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s toxic buildup from infrequent bowel movements or inflammatory strain from too many, your bathroom schedule could be one of the clearest windows into how your body’s functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;As science continues to explore the gut-body connection, one thing is becoming evident: regularity isn’t just about rhythm — it’s about resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Backed by federal funding, the findings appeared in the journal &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13754#.Y5nVITl-nME.twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/a&gt; and are already sparking fresh interest in the field of brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NR acts as a building block for a molecule known as NAD+, which plays a critical role in fixing damaged cells and DNA. As people grow older—or face long-term illnesses—NAD+ levels fall. That drop is tied to health problems like obesity and damage caused by smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Martens, now a professor at the University of Delaware, started exploring NR during his postdoc work at &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Colorado Boulder&lt;/a&gt;. His early studies showed that NR raised NAD+ levels in the blood. But he wasn’t sure if it could reach the brain, where it might help the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Christopher Martens, director of the Delaware Center for Cognitive Aging Research is leading a study into whether nicotinamide riboside (NR) improves memory and brain blood flow in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. (CREDIT: University of Delaware) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standard brain scans, like MRIs, can’t directly measure NAD+ and are costly and hard to use in large studies. To get around this, the team used an inventive method: testing extracellular vesicles (EVs). These are tiny particles released by brain cells that float through the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;EVs offer a unique window into brain activity. By measuring NAD+ in these particles, researchers gained a more direct view of what was happening inside the brain. This technique could become a simpler way to track &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/belly-fat-can-impact-brain-health-and-increase-risk-for-alzheimer-s-study-finds/"&gt;brain changes over time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a six-week clinical trial, NAD+ levels in these EVs rose after daily NR use. At the same time, shifts were seen in proteins tied to Alzheimer's, including &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/cutting-edge-drugs-show-promise-against-alzheimer-s-parkinson-s-and-type-2-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;amyloid beta&lt;/a&gt; and tau. These proteins often build up in brains affected by the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martens pointed out that this link between NAD+ and brain proteins suggests NR might affect more than one brain process. That possibility makes it a promising tool for slowing—or perhaps one day preventing—brain decline linked to aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martens is currently leading a 12-week study investigating NR's effects on older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Supported by the &lt;a href="https://sites.udel.edu/memory-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;Delaware Center for Cognitive Aging Research&lt;/a&gt; and the NIA, this study aims to determine whether NR supplementation yields greater benefits in individuals with cognitive deficits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the limited effectiveness of current &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/can-health-and-lifestyle-changes-protect-the-elderly-from-alzheimer-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s medications&lt;/a&gt; in halting disease progression, Martens hopes that NR supplementation may preserve cognitive function and quality of life in affected individuals. The ongoing trial also seeks to elucidate NR's underlying mechanisms and its potential to slow neurodegenerative disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Martens and Kapogiannis plan to explore NR's effects on cognition and its potential as a therapeutic intervention for &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/coffee-grounds-hold-the-key-to-preventing-alzheimer-s-parkinson-s-and-huntington-s-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt;.

NR is a precursor to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/how-sugar-promotes-inflammation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;crucial coenzyme&lt;/a&gt; involved in various metabolic processes. Here are some of the key medical benefits of NR:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 heading css-c8ba2x" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="enhanced_cellular_energy_production"&gt;Enhanced Cellular Energy Production&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NR boosts levels of NAD+, which plays a pivotal role in cellular energy production. Higher NAD+ levels improve mitochondrial function, leading to better energy production and potentially alleviating symptoms of chronic fatigue and age-related energy decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 heading css-c8ba2x" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="neuroprotection"&gt;Neuroprotection&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NR has shown promise in protecting brain cells from &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/zinc-dietary-supplement-can-reverse-lung-damage-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;age-related damage&lt;/a&gt; and neurodegenerative diseases. Studies suggest that increased NAD+ levels can enhance neuronal function, support cognitive health, and potentially slow the progression of conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 heading css-c8ba2x" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="cardiovascular_health"&gt;Cardiovascular Health&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NR may benefit &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/sleep-quality-directly-linked-to-cardiovascular-health-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt; by improving mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress. Enhanced NAD+ levels are associated with better endothelial function, which can help maintain healthy blood vessels and reduce the risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 heading css-c8ba2x" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="anti_aging_properties"&gt;Anti-Aging Properties&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NR's ability to increase NAD+ levels has been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/breakthrough-research-offers-new-hope-for-anti-aging-therapies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anti-aging effects&lt;/a&gt;. NAD+ is involved in DNA repair and the activation of sirtuins, proteins that regulate cellular health and longevity. As a result, NR supplementation may help reduce the visible signs of aging and improve overall vitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NR may support metabolic health by enhancing insulin sensitivity and promoting healthy lipid metabolism. These effects can help manage blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 heading css-c8ba2x" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="muscle_health_and_physical_performance"&gt;Muscle Health and Physical Performance&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By boosting NAD+ levels, NR can &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/game-changing-discovery-restores-muscle-strength-in-adults-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;improve muscle function&lt;/a&gt; and physical performance. This is particularly beneficial for older adults who experience muscle weakness and reduced physical capacity due to aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h5 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h5 heading css-c8ba2x" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="support_for_immune_function"&gt;Support for Immune Function&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NR has been shown to enhance the immune response by improving the function of immune cells. This can help the body better defend against infections and may have implications for &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/eating-these-beans-can-improve-gut-health-immunity-and-overall-wellbeing-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;overall immune health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="21" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While research is ongoing, NR supplementation appears to be a promising avenue for improving various aspects of health and well-being.

But 80 is a big one, his friends insisted in between stories of his generosity, his compassion, his resiliency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for someone who’s lived more than half of his life with AIDS, 80 is almost unimaginable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="A300" data-large-id="CONCERT1" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a man I’ve known since the 1980s, and there are very few people I can say that about,” said Gregg Cassin, a friend of Breaux’s and a long-term HIV survivor himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many HIV survivors, Breaux has spent decades figuring out how to live when all he knew for so long was death. “Not dying is not the same as living,” Breaux said last Friday on his birthday, a thought that resonated with other long-term survivors at the party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Aguilar, left, joins in the birthday celebration for his friend Harry Breaux. Featured a decade ago the Chronicle story and documentary “Last Men Standing,” Breaux has been living with HIV since 1985.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jana Ašenbrennerová/For the S.F. Chronicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, Breaux was featured in &lt;a href="https://projects.sfchronicle.com/2016/living-with-aids/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Last Men Standing&lt;/a&gt;, a story and documentary published by the Chronicle profiling eight long-term survivors of AIDS. One of the men died before the story was published and another died five years ago. Breaux was the oldest of the men profiled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breaux spoke then of the wars that were waged in the ’80s and ’90s to get AIDS to be taken seriously by the federal government and to get life-saving treatments. At age 70, he said he felt like he was fighting all over again as attention shifted away from HIV/AIDS and the needs of long-term survivors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ten years ago it was exciting to be alive,” Breaux said, recalling the budding movement to get resources for long-term survivors so they could live safely and comfortably in San Francisco, with access to their community and health care providers. “It was a challenge, of course, but it felt like we had government support to a good degree.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 80, that fight continues, but Breaux is tired. He finds he has to pick his battles. He’s currently growing out a beard that he refuses to shave until there’s a new president in the White House. Locally, he’s working on a project to paint a rainbow mural in the Castro District, and he recently joined a city aging and disability advisory council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A photo of Harry Breaux. "Best picture ever of me as a hippie, taken at Shambala, 1972."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alina Grogorians/Photo courtesy of Harry Breaux&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;His involvement in his community, though, tends to be more intimate. At his birthday party, friends told stories of him showing up to help them move, bringing them food or delivering their mail when they were sick. Multiple people referred to him as a big brother or mentor. “Harry has one of the biggest hearts I’ve ever seen,” said one friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breaux tested positive for HIV in 1985 in San Francisco, during the worst years of the AIDS epidemic, when the diagnosis was essentially a death sentence. He lost countless friends to the disease. He came perilously close to dying once himself, in 1996, and pulled through in time to access the drugs that had been developed to fight HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But surviving has not been easy — not for Breaux and many other long-term HIV survivors. They’ve endured enormous trauma and loss. Though AIDS likely won’t kill them, they suffer debilitating health problems related to the illness and the sometimes toxic treatments. Most never planned for a long life, so they don’t have savings or homes; some never worked. Many older survivors live alone and struggle to find a community to engage with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some struggle to find a purpose — to live, instead of not dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harry Breaux, then 70, runs through the 2015 San Francisco Pride Celebration &amp;amp; Parade dressed as Dr. Frank-N-Furter from “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tim Hussin/The Chronicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco, once the epicenter of the nation’s battle against AIDS, HIV is now an old person’s disease. New cases are unusual among young people, and almost three-quarters of people living with HIV are 50 or older. That’s a stark change from the roughest years of the epidemic, when the disease hit mostly people in their 20s and 30s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re getting older. They’re much frailer,” said Vince Crisostomo, who runs the 50-Plus Network, a group for older men with HIV at the San Francisco AIDS Foundation; Breaux was a founding member of the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crisostomo said he regularly asks the survivors to think of their legacies — to imagine the stories they want to leave behind about their own lives. Many of the older survivors he works with are frustrated, resentful or ashamed that they haven’t met some of the traditional markers of success — they don’t have homes or careers, spouses or children. They think of who they could have been, if not for the death sentence of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the birthday lunch, Breaux told Crisostomo that he wasn’t sure he had anything to show for his 80 years.

Although he had no curfew, he rarely stayed out this late. Unable to sleep, I watched his movements, waiting for the telltale signs that he was in an Uber and heading home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since installing a tracking app on the phones of my teenage twin sons, this anxious late-night ritual has become all too familiar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The blue dot’s journey across my screen became my nightly companion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; I quickly discovered I was far from alone. According to &lt;a href="https://cybernews.com/news/parents-tracking-kids-online-activities/#:~:text=58%25%20of%20parents%20say%20they,in%20their%20children's%20cell%20phones." target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a recent survey" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67db2589e4b0abb74b13da8f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://cybernews.com/news/parents-tracking-kids-online-activities/#:~:text=58%25%20of%20parents%20say%20they,in%20their%20children's%20cell%20phones." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;a recent survey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;58% of parents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; use cell phones with built-in tracking features, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;while 53% rely&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; on dedicated family monitoring apps. Like many of these parents, I initially installed the app for safety, but what I discovered about myself went much deeper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What began as a practical safety measure gradually revealed something I hadn’t fully acknowledged: how much I crave being present in my sons’ lives. I divorced when they were 3 and have since missed countless moments, from learning to ride a bike to school presentations to everyday conversations that many parents take for granted. The tracking app became a way I felt connected to them, a digital substitute for being there in person.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.parentingpathfinders.com/about" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Michelle Felder" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67db2589e4b0abb74b13da8f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.parentingpathfinders.com/about" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michelle Felder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a psychotherapist and parenting expert, explains this behavior: “Parents who have anxious-preoccupied attachment styles may use monitoring as a way of maintaining a feeling of connection with their child.” However, identifying a pattern is only the first step. What matters is how we channel these feelings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For parents in shared custody arrangements, Felder suggests using tracking constructively: “A parent with limited time with their child might use a tracking app as a starting point for connection; for example, sending a text saying, ‘I see you made it home safely. I hope your presentation went well — I can’t wait to hear all about it!’ This engages, shows care and keeps communication open.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a teenager, my parents had no idea where I was when I stayed out — just the vague promise that I’d be home “later.” They’d leave the porch light on, imagining worst-case scenarios if I was home too late. Today’s technology has replaced that brand of parental anxiety with something more complex. We can now track our children’s movements in real time, but that constant ability to check in creates its own kind of tension. Now, there is the temptation to monitor rather than trust our children. Sometimes, I wonder if my parents’ forced ignorance of my exact whereabouts was a blessing in disguise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While my compulsive checking had become a habit, my wife had a different perspective on their independence&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span&gt;“They’ll call if they need us,” she says with a confidence I wish I had. Her approach isn’t from lack of caring; she loves them deeply but with a healthier sense of boundaries. Seeing her relationship with my sons thrive without digital surveillance helped me recognize my monitoring habit as something I needed to fix. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reenabpatel.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Reena B.

Patel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a parenting expert and licensed psychologist, recommends that parents regularly ask themselves reflective questions: “Have I been frequently tracking my teens’ locations? Have I invaded their privacy too much? When am I overly hovering? Do I assume they are lying right off the bat?” These questions can help identify when monitoring crosses into over-surveillance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These questions never crossed my mind until a meeting a few months ago, when I instinctively opened the app as we waited to begin. “You check that app a lot,” a client remarked. “Is something wrong?” Her simple question caught me off guard. I wasn’t responding to any danger; rather, the app had become my unconscious habit, driven by separation anxiety rather than actual parenting needs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author and his sons at age 3.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When minimizing their own anxiety becomes the driving force behind a parent’s monitoring, rather than meeting their child’s needs or maintaining safety, it could be a sign that tracking has shifted to unhealthy surveillance,” Felder noted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;For parents questioning their own habits, she suggests watching for signs like&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;repeatedly checking their teen’s location or finding it difficult to engage in other activities because they’re constantly checking a tracking app.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My sons have developed a much more balanced approach to location sharing, which starkly contrasts with my own. When they went on an interstate vacation with friends during school break, they downloaded a tracking app to look out for each other. They were using the app the way I had intended to — to ensure safety. Seeing how they used tracking technology forced me to confront how I had used it — for my emotional reassurance, rather than their well-being.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’ve slowly learned to distinguish between legitimate safety monitoring and anxiety-driven surveillance&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span&gt;Safety checks happen when they’re out late or in unfamiliar places. The problematic behavior happens when I find myself checking every few minutes to see if they’ve left a place, information I could simply get with a text. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One source of the anxiety comes from parental duty, the other from unresolved feelings about missing parts of their childhood. Before opening the tracking app, I now ask myself: “Am I checking for them or me?” Recently, when I wondered if they’d made it to their after-school activities, I deliberately chose to text them directly rather than check the app. It was a small step toward more direct communication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Digital technology has created new challenges around surveillance and independence. “As technology advances, parental monitoring continues to move away from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;the occasional check-in or reliance on community oversight&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;to constant digital tracking — which can blur the lines between safety and surveillance,” Felder noted&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span&gt;Over time, this shift may contribute to decreased adolescent autonomy and may eventually lead society to accept encroaching upon a teen’s privacy as an expected part of growing up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Patel has advice for parents struggling with their tracking habits. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Parents should clearly communicate the purpose of tracking their teens, respecting privacy, using technology transparently, limiting frequency and adjusting monitoring levels as needed&lt;/span&gt;,”&lt;span&gt; Patel said. “It’s important to understand that teens’ independence grows as they age, so the level of monitoring should evolve to accommodate this growing need.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Through this experience, I’ve discovered that my tracking behavior was driven by my fear of missing out on their lives. My divorce created a void I unconsciously tried to fill by digitally monitoring my son’s movements. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

Trimethylamine is produced by bacteria in the gut as a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-017-0271-9" target="_blank" data-url="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-017-0271-9" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;byproduct of the digestion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of certain foods, including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/trimethylaminuria/" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/trimethylaminuria/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eggs, liver, legumes and specific kinds of seafood&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, such as fish, squid and crabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/evolution/why-cant-we-smell-ourselves-as-well-as-we-smell-others" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/evolution/why-cant-we-smell-ourselves-as-well-as-we-smell-others"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why can't we smell ourselves as well as we smell others?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, an enzyme in the body &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.genome.gov/Genetic-Disorders/Trimethylaminuria" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.genome.gov/Genetic-Disorders/Trimethylaminuria" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;breaks down trimethylamine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into an odorless chemical, known as trimethylamine N-oxide, which is then excreted &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/trimethylaminuria/" target="_blank" data-url="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/trimethylaminuria/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;via urine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This enzyme is encoded by a gene called FMO3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In patients with TMAU, though, this enzymatic process doesn't occur, so trimethylamine accumulates in the body and ends up being released in excess quantities in patients' &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/trimethylaminuria/" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/trimethylaminuria/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;sweat, urine and breath&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

In these instances, patients inherit the disease in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning they must inherit two copies of the mutated FMO3 gene — one from each parent — to develop the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More rarely, TMAU can be caused by consuming a large quantity of foods that lead to trimethylamine production. It can also result from liver failure and certain medical treatments, such as testosterone replacement therapy, which impact the processing and production of trimethylamine, respectively. Hormonal changes brought about by the menstrual cycle can also cause a transient form of TMAU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Patients with trimethylaminuria should avoid eating seafood, which can aggravate their symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Oscar Wong via Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;Symptoms of TMAU may be &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/trimethylaminuria/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/trimethylaminuria/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;present from birth or arise later in life&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, normally near the start of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534827/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534827/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;puberty&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (roughly around age 8 to 13 in females and 9 to 14 in males), when &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594255/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594255/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;many hormonal changes happen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients with TMAU &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/trimethylaminuria/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/trimethylaminuria/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;have a strong fishy odor all the time&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while the smell may come and go for others with the condition.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/signal-group-chat-attack-plans-hegseth-goldberg/682176/"&gt;published the full text thread&lt;/a&gt; in which top administration officials discussed plans for a U.S. military campaign targeting the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen. In the communications—conducted over a Signal group chat to which &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertently added—Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared sensitive operational details about the March 15 airstrikes on the same day they were carried out. Appearing to &lt;a href="https://x.com/JenGriffinFNC/status/1905034953865212260"&gt;contradict&lt;/a&gt; administration officials’ insistence that the chat did not divulge classified information, the messages included information about the timing of attacks using F-18 fighter jets, MQ-9 drones, and Tomahawk cruise missiles. “If this text had been received by someone hostile to American interests—or someone merely indiscreet, and with access to social media—the Houthis would have had time to prepare for what was meant to be a surprise attack on their strongholds,” Goldberg noted in &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/signal-group-chat-attack-plans-hegseth-goldberg/682176/"&gt;the report&lt;/a&gt;. “The consequences for American pilots could have been catastrophic.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/world/europe/sudan-khartoum-war-rsf-withdrawal.html"&gt;retaken the country’s capital&lt;/a&gt; of Khartoum, Sudan’s military chief, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, announced Wednesday. The capital city has been at the center of fighting throughout the nearly two-year civil war between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which as of late 2024 had left more than &lt;a href="https://acleddata.com/conflict-watchlist-2025/sudan/?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=Protests%20Erupt%20As%20Turkish%20Opposition%20Leader%20Jailed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=The%20Morning%20Dispatch_TMD%20Paid%20Subscribers%20Only_Protests%20Erupt%20As%20Turkish%20Opposition%20Leader%20Jailed"&gt;28,000 people&lt;/a&gt; dead nationwide and displaced 11 million others. The capture of Khartoum and its &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-26/sudanese-army-says-capital-s-airport-recaptured-from-militia"&gt;international airport&lt;/a&gt; marked a key victory for the SAF, though fighting is likely to continue as the RSF fighters dig in in the western Darfur region.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brazil’s Supreme Court unanimously ruled Wednesday that former President Jair Bolsonaro &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/brazil-bolsonaro-coup-supreme-court-coup-attempt-d236f94bae936e05017187711add3063?taid=67e41fcb5b3aba000153cfd7&amp;amp;utm_campaign=TrueAnthem&amp;amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter"&gt;must stand trial&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly attempting to overturn his loss in the country’s 2022 election and planning a coup. Prosecutors accuse the country’s former leader of plotting to kill his successor, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, as well as the vice president and a Supreme Court justice. Bolsonaro, who has long denied the charges against him, &lt;a href="https://x.com/jairbolsonaro/status/1904917618429239782"&gt;said Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that he is facing a “political trial” aimed at preventing him from running for president in 2026. The justices &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/26/nx-s1-5341507/bolsonaro-brazil-trial-coup-attempt"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that seven of Bolsonaro’s political allies should also stand trial on five counts for their alleged involvement in the scheme. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;President Donald Trump on Wednesday &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/26/economy/auto-tariffs-announcement/index.html"&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/adjusting-imports-of-automobiles-and-autombile-parts-into-the-united-states/"&gt;an executive order&lt;/a&gt; imposing 25 percent tariffs on cars and car parts imported into the United States. The new duties, which are intended to boost the domestic auto industry, are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/us/trump-tariffs-auto-cars.html?smid=url-share"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to hit both foreign manufacturers and American automakers who build cars abroad or import components. However, the White House &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/03/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-adjusts-imports-of-automobiles-and-automobile-parts-into-the-united-states/"&gt;later noted&lt;/a&gt; that auto parts covered by the U.S.-Canada-Mexico Agreement (USMCA) would be exempt until Customs and Border Protection “establishes a process to apply tariffs to their non-U.S. content.” The measures are set to take effect on April 3 at 12:01 a.m. ET. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Circuit on Wednesday &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5216594-appeals-court-keeps-block-on-trumps-sweeping-funding-freeze/"&gt;denied a request&lt;/a&gt; by the Trump administration to reverse a block on its efforts to pause federal funding to states. The decision, which bars the Office of Management and Budget from implementing a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/29/g-s1-45313/trump-federal-funding-freeze-reversed"&gt;now-rescinded&lt;/a&gt; January memo freezing federal payments, came in response to lawsuits brought by attorneys general from 22 states and the District of Columbia. In &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca1.52591/gov.uscourts.ca1.52591.00108264760.0.pdf"&gt;an opinion&lt;/a&gt; upholding U.S. District Judge John McConnell’s &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/federal-grants-loans-spending-freeze-trump-administration-6620ef49a21f88f83f8f998805b92677"&gt;ruling&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, the three-judge panel wrote that the freeze would result in a “number of harms” to the plaintiff states, including “the inability to pay existing debt; impediments to planning, hiring, and operations; and disruptions to research projects by state universities.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                    &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary (HHS) Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may not be chatty on Signal, but he’s making plenty of noise in the medical world. Just over a month into his tenure, Kennedy is beginning to reverse one of the first Trump administration’s major successes: mRNA vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As COVID-19 spread across the U.S. in 2020, the Trump administration launched Operation Warp Speed—an initiative that brought the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine to market in record time. But with the pandemic also came &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-booed-alabama-rally-after-telling-supporters-get-vaccinated-n1277404"&gt;a revival&lt;/a&gt; of vaccine skepticism. Now, with Kennedy atop HHS, that anti-vax sentiment is making its way to the highest levels of government just as scientists are achieving striking breakthroughs in mRNA research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;        


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immunization technology using mRNA is not like vaccines of the past. “It’s a very novel approach,” Dr. Chris Beyrer, an epidemiologist and head of the Duke Global Health Institute, explained to &lt;strong&gt;TMD&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Messenger RNA is a molecule that acts as the transcript for creating a protein, like an antibody or an antigen. But when mRNA is injected into the body, it is quickly degraded by certain enzymes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recent advances in nanotechnology led to a major innovation: mRNA could be wrapped in a lipid nanoparticle, which is how both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines delivered messages to cells through mRNA. In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, the message tells the cell to make a “spike protein” similar to what is found on the virus, prompting the immune system to &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2021/07/everything-you-need-to-know-about-mrna-vaccines/"&gt;create antibodies&lt;/a&gt; that help the body fight off a future infection. The COVID-19 versions would eventually be the first mRNA vaccines to become available for widespread use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breakthrough is largely credited to the first Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed, a partnership between the federal government and the private sector to rapidly develop the vaccines during the pandemic. The Trump administration spent more than &lt;a href="https://time.com/5921360/operation-warp-speed-vaccine-spending/"&gt;$12 billion&lt;/a&gt; on the effort, leading to the emergency-use authorization of the two-dose Pfizer vaccine in just &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9433349/"&gt;nine months&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was one of the greater scientific or medical achievements in my lifetime,” Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania, told &lt;strong&gt;TMD&lt;/strong&gt;. “So would I have initially said that Donald Trump supported mRNA vaccines? Yes, more than any other president or any other person in the history of this country.” And the success sparked a wave of promising research into other, non-COVID medical applications, particularly because the vaccines could be updated and manufactured quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the final days of the Biden administration, HHS &lt;a href="https://public3.pagefreezer.com/browse/HHS.gov/21-01-2025T07:38/https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/01/17/hhs-provides-590-million-accelerate-pandemic-influenza-mrna-based-vaccine-development-enhance-platform-capability-other-emerging-infectious-disease.html"&gt;awarded&lt;/a&gt; Moderna a $590 million grant to develop mRNA vaccines against influenza viruses, allowing the pharmaceutical company to fast-track work on a bird flu vaccine. A vaccine against &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2025/02/21/groundbreaking-study-shows-potential-of-new-mrna-vaccine-to-help.html"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; recently underwent successful preclinical trials in Australia, and Moderna is currently &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-posts-bigger-loss-than-expected-vaccine-maker-scales-down-manufacturing-2025-02-14/"&gt;working&lt;/a&gt; on a vaccine for norovirus, although trials have been put on pause because of side effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the technology may have applications beyond the prevention of infectious diseases. Researchers believe it could be used to treat cancer. “Because you have this lipid nanoparticle, you can target it specifically to a cancer cell,” Offit said. “It has a lot of promise as a cancer therapy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.K., scientists recently completed the final stage of testing in research into whether personalized mRNA vaccines can be used to treat cancer patients. “It finished one year ahead of schedule,” Dr. Lennard Lee, the medical director of the Ellison Institute of Technology Oxford and a leading researcher for the U.K.’s cancer vaccine initiative, told &lt;strong&gt;TMD&lt;/strong&gt;. The trial’s results are still pending, but it could be completed within five years of when the mRNA vaccine for COVID-19 first became available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, a phase I trial of an mRNA &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/pancreatic-cancer-vaccine-mrna-treatment-trial-rcna192702"&gt;vaccine against&lt;/a&gt; pancreatic cancer—which has a &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html"&gt;survival rate&lt;/a&gt; of only 12.8 percent—produced encouraging results. Of the eight trial participants whose bodies responded to the vaccine, only two saw their cancer return within three years, compared to seven of the eight whose bodies did not respond to the treatment. And researchers are studying whether the technology can be used to treat other forms of cancer. Last year, doctors &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/apr/26/cancer-mrna-vaccine-melanoma-trial"&gt;kicked off&lt;/a&gt; a phase II trial for an mRNA vaccine against melanoma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the promising developments coincide with growing vaccine skepticism from top U.S. health agencies. Earlier this month, the National Institute of Health (NIH) instructed its staff to compile a list of federal grants going toward mRNA vaccine research, raising the specter of targeted cuts. The Biden administration’s $590 million grant to Moderna for bird flu research is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/trump-team-weighs-pulling-funding-for-moderna-bird-flu-vaccine"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; being reevaluated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And work on mRNA immunization appears to have already been caught up in the Trump administration’s cost-cutting efforts. According to Beyrer, a grant to develop an mRNA vaccine against HIV in Africa was slashed amid the push to shutter the United States Agency for International Development. And a grant to a Columbia University scientist studying the body’s immune response to mRNA was also reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00828-3"&gt;canceled&lt;/a&gt;. “You’re seeing people who have grants to study mRNA as vaccines, or as immune therapeutics, or cancer vaccines that are starting to lose their grants,” Offit said. “Trump, who was arguably a champion of mRNA vaccines, is no longer a champion for them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether further efforts to curtail mRNA immunization research are coming down the pipeline is an open question. But there are signs that cuts to vaccine research more broadly may be imminent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NIH recently moved to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5325863/nih-trump-vaccine-hesitancy-mrna-research#:~:text=Now%2C%20more%20than%2040%20grants%20related%20to%20vaccine%20hesitancy%20have%20been%20cancelled%2C%20and%20there%20are%20mounting%20concerns%20that%20research%20on%20mRNA%20vaccines%20could%20be%20on%20the%20chopping%20block%20next."&gt;eliminate or limit&lt;/a&gt; more than 40 grants for studies seeking to understand growing vaccine hesitancy. “I think that’s one of the clearest indications we have about the hostility to vaccine science from this administration,” Beyrer said of the decision. And just a week after Kennedy was confirmed as its head, HHS announced that it had &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-cdc-vaccine-advisory-meeting-be-postponed-stat-news-reports-2025-02-20/"&gt;postponed&lt;/a&gt; the meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)—a panel of experts who advise the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccines. The postponement, according to the HHS, was to accommodate public comment. ACIP is now scheduled to meet in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a very important meeting timing-wise to decide what antigen should go into the next year’s flu vaccine, and then give the manufacturers about six months lead time to manufacture and evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines,” Beyrer said. “This is threatening the next flu vaccine.” The Food and Drug Administration’s advisory committee on vaccines has also been &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/27/nx-s1-5311670/the-fda-has-canceled-an-important-upcoming-meeting-about-vaccines"&gt;canceled&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re living in dangerous times,” Offit said. “I think it’s going to get worse before it gets better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        Over a few short years, small drones have morphed from playthings—meant for wedding photography and weekend hobbyists—to deadly weapons of war, dozens of which can be coordinated for maximum effect. In fact, drones have become the defining weapon of the war in Ukraine, allowing a country with a meager air force, few missiles, and a scant navy to hit targets far beyond the frontlines. Mathematician's unit, part of the Khartiia Brigade station in the northeast corner of Ukraine, is engaged in some of the most cutting-edge drone innovation in the world. In December, the brigade pulled off the first ever air- and ground-drone assault on a Russian position. To pull it off, they had to come up with new methods of mission planning, tactics, and coordination procedures from scratch.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

                                                            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing for &lt;em&gt;Comment Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, Nick Spencer considered whether the West is in &lt;a href="https://comment.org/the-great-overcorrection/"&gt;the midst of a great overcorrection&lt;/a&gt;. “We in the West have never loved our political leaders. Mass Observation studies of Britain in the 1930s and 1940s reported the public describing the political class as ‘hypocritical’ and ‘distrusted,’ full of ‘twisters,’ ‘clever rogues,’ and ‘liars.’ Skepticism toward political leaders is the price of democracy,” he wrote. “If, as many people think, healthy skepticism has long since tipped over into a corrosive cynicism, some kind of course correction is welcome. And yet we are seeing signs of a perilous overcorrection. Polls tell us that a perturbing number of (especially) young people say they want a strong leader, unencumbered by the tedious restraints of democracy, to ‘sort things out.’ Donald Trump’s apparent preference for autocrats over the democratically elected leaders that have traditionally made up America’s allies adds fuel to this fire. The trend has generated some excitable headlines. ‘More than half of Gen Z wants UK to become a dictatorship,’ one headline claimed. … Correcting for democracy’s undoubted inadequacies, we cannot afford to overcorrect our way to autocracy.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to have tremendous goodies in the bag for women, too,” Trump said Wednesday. “The women, between the fertilization and all of the other things that we’re talking about, it’s going to be great.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fertilization,” he said as people in the audience laughed. “I’m still very proud of it. I don’t care. I’ll be known as the fertilization president and that’s not bad. I’ve been called much worse and actually, I like it. I like it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The modern remake of the classic fairytale currently has a dismal 1.6 out of 10 stars &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6208148/"&gt;on IMDb&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ll let you be the judge. &lt;/p&gt;

Mott Children's Hospital tried CPR for an hour, but his heart would not restart. So they put Lev'Veon on a heart-lung bypass machine until they could implant an artificial heart.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_sh_li"&gt;On Sept. 6, 2024, Lev'Veon became the first child in Michigan to get a total artificial heart, and he is possibly the smallest child in the world to receive the implant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Lev'Veon Jones-White ran, climbed and jumped alongside his siblings and cousins at the McDonald's Indoor PlayPlace in Belleville on an evening in late February. He laughed and chased one of his cousins into the enormous maze of tunnels and tubes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;To watch him play, it would be easy to presume Lev'Veon is an ordinary, strong and healthy 10-year-old boy, but he is anything but ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Lev'Veon — an athlete who swam competitively and played football and the trombone — nearly died in late August, when his heart suddenly stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The staff at C.S. Mott Children's Hospital in Ann Arbor performed CPR for 60 minutes and then put Lev'Veon on a heart-lung bypass machine called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, when it was clear his heart wasn't going to restart. Ordinarily, ECMO can keep a person alive long enough for the heart and the lungs to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But in Lev'Veon's case, the heart that once sustained him, pumping blood throughout his body with rhythmic beats, withered and died. His kidneys failed and his lung function began to decline, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Left with few options, the doctors did something that had never been done before in a child in Michigan: They removed Lev'Veon's heart and replaced it with a totally artificial heart that kept him alive for 24 days — long enough for his kidneys and lungs to rebound and for him to get a human heart transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"He was one of the smallest and youngest patients to have ever received one of these total artificial hearts worldwide," said Dr. David Peng, director of pediatric heart failure and mechanical circulatory support at Mott.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Although the University of Michigan Health had implanted the SynCardia Total Artificial Heart in adults, they had never tried to use the device on a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Lev'Veon's resilience through the entire ordeal was "remarkable," Peng said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Months later, as Lev'Veon played with his cousins and siblings, he lifted his shirt to show the scars that pock his belly and chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="gnt_em gnt_em_gl gnt_em__el" href="/picture-gallery/news/local/michigan/2025/03/27/ypsilanti-10-year-old-boy-believed-to-be-smallest-to-ever-get-total-artificial-heart/82568125007/" data-t-l=":l|l|c|view gallery:inline promo" aria-label="View Gallery - Ypsilanti 10-year-old boy believed to be smallest to ever get total artificial heart" data-g-r="nav_mo" data-g-tn="pgcss" data-g-mtn="pg82568125007" data-g-moh="hpgm" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-expanded="false" data-c-id="82568125007"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_gl_i" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/20/PDTF/82568043007-022425-dfp-artificial-heart-rg-16.jpg?crop=2399,1351,x0,y124&amp;amp;width=660&amp;amp;height=372&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/20/PDTF/82568043007-022425-dfp-artificial-heart-rg-16.jpg?crop=2399,1351,x0,y124&amp;amp;width=1320&amp;amp;height=744&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt=""&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_gl_i_nt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_gl_vg" data-c-tc="13"&gt;&lt;svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg__ca"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_camera"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;svg class="gnt_em_gl_vg_svg"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#gnt_svg_expand"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_t gnt_em_t__hb" data-c-et="Ypsilanti 10-year-old boy believed to be smallest to ever get total artificial heart" aria-label="There were few options when Lev'Veon Jones-White's heart suddenly stopped in August.

It hurted a little bit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;The day when everything changed for Lev'Veon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Lev'Veon spent his littlest sister's 3rd birthday playing in the late summer sun. He went to football practice that day and then joined his family in his sister's favorite game: pretending the floor is lava and jumping onto obstacles to avoid the make-believe molten rock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;At bedtime, Lev'Veon couldn't get comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"It was time to lay down, and I had this big, bad headache ... and then, my stomach kind of hurt," Lev'Veon recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;His stepmother, RayVonia White, 30, of Ypsilanti, said she told him to close his eyes and try to relax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"When I went back and checked on him, he was crying," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Although he doesn't have asthma, Lev'Veon told her that he couldn't breathe. His chest hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;White works as a medical assistant at Packard Health and knew his symptoms could be serious. She put him in the back seat of the family's car and took him to Mott.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"When I got to the hospital, I felt lightheaded," Lev'Veon said. "I didn't feel like I could breathe, so I had to use a wheelchair. And then, when I got to the room, I threw up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The emergency department staff monitored Lev'Veon's heart and noticed some blips on his electrocardiogram (ECG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"They did see some subtle ECG changes," Peng said. "So, with the chest pain, they observed him overnight. We actually got an echo ultrasound of the heart out of an abundance of caution, and at that time, the first echo was completely normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"He was actually going to be discharged the following morning, after some observation, but he started having more ECG blips and abnormalities, and then some arrhythmias that rapidly progressed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Lev'Veon was moved to the cardiac intensive care unit, where, Peng said, he "progressed to full-blown cardiac arrest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;White said she'll never forget the moment when Lev'Veon's heart monitor flat-lined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I was sitting down, talking and crocheting, and keeping my husband up to date with everything," she said, as Lev'Veon sat in his hospital bed watching YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It was about 7 or 8 a.m., and they'd been put in an isolation room because White was recovering from COVID-19. A nurse had just come in to talk with Lev'Veon about ordering breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"The nurse kept coming in and checking on things," White said. The nurse was growing increasingly concerned and was watching the heart monitor intently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Then came the flat line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"He coded," White said, and the nurse pressed a button to call for help. "When she pressed that button, so many people came flooding in. So many people, it was like a movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I was crying ugly tears. ... Everybody was around Lev'Veon, and they were pushing on his chest and lining up to take turns for who would be next doing CPR."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It wasn't long before White was whisked out of the room so they could continue their efforts to save Lev'Veon's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Artificial heart is boy's 'Hail Mary'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"When you think about heart attack, you don't think about a 10-year-old kid who is otherwise healthy," said Dr. Timothy Lancaster, assistant professor of cardiac surgery at the University of Michigan and the pediatric heart surgeon who operated on Lev'Veon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"The little guy's parents were astute enough to know that he's saying something doesn't feel right, so we're going to take him to the emergency department at Mott. That doesn't always happen. A lot of times kids say their chest hurts, and parents say, 'Maybe you should just sit down and have a drink of water and you'll be fine.' "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Lev'Veon had developed myocarditis, which is a dangerous type of heart inflammation that was most likely triggered by a virus — possibly by the coronavirus that had made his stepmother ill, Lancaster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"This could happen to anyone," he said. "It's an equal opportunity kind of disease. Any healthy kid, any healthy person could have the bad luck of getting a virus that provokes their inflammatory response, their immune system to do this, and that's very scary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I have kids around this age. Lots of my partners and colleagues have kids around this age, and I think it hits home a little harder when we see a kid come ... from our community who could be any one of our kids and be thrust into this life-or-death situation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When their attempts to resuscitate Lev'Veon's heart failed, the team at Mott quickly worked to connect him to ECMO, Lancaster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Most patients who have myocarditis ... will recover," he said. "The heart will kind of heal itself and the inflammatory process will subside. But in the first three or four days, it became evident to us that his case was different than the average case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The ECMO wasn't supporting Lev'Veon's circulation well enough to keep his kidneys and lungs healthy. He was too fragile to undergo transplant surgery. The thought was that if they could implant a total artificial heart, it might allow Lev'Veon time to get stronger so he would be ready for a transplant when a matching donor heart became available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"So, we started mobilizing to try to do this total artificial heart idea, which was new for our center, so it required a lot of logistical planning and preparation and education," Lancaster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Peng said it was an extreme measure, but "we knew that Lev'Veon really didn't have any other options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Our entire heart center — from surgeons to cardiologists, nurses, to therapists — got on board with trying this. It's not too far-fetched to say this was a Hail Mary for Lev'Veon. And everyone, within a couple days, was trained and learned this new device so that we could implant it in Lev'Veon and take care of him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;At just 90 pounds, he would become among the smallest — if not the smallest — in the world to have the implant, Lancaster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"He is kind of a tall, skinny guy with a narrow chest," Lancaster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On Sept. 6, the day Lev'Veon got his total artificial heart, his entire family came to the hospital — his father, Antwan White; Lev'Veon's sisters, Layla and Lanae, his brother, Legend, his grandmother, Annette Dukes, his cousins, aunts and uncles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"They let friends, and all of our family come up, even though it was past visiting hours," White said. "We had the whole lobby full, and my pastor came up to pray. ... One of my favorite aunties brought food and others brought pizza, and they were trying to make sure I was eating. You kind of forget to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"So many people really came out in our time of need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Lev'Veon, she said, wasn't scared. She tried not to be, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Doctors told the family that the total artificial heart was Lev'Veon's best chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"They explained to us that they have a solution, and that with this solution, no kid in Michigan had ever done it before," White said. "The doctors said it would work &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; it could fit. They don't make these in a kid's size. ... They were saying that they were confident that they could do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I had to be confident they could, too. You don't really have a choice, you know? ... I had my faith. I was praying about it, and I was willing to do anything to help save my baby. I had to have confidence in them and faith in my Lord to see him through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As the medical staff wheeled Lev'Veon into the operating room for surgery, White said, "I didn't say goodbye. I told him I'd see him later, and that he was going to go in for surgery and that I'd be there waiting for him. I took a picture with him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Preparing for a Michigan first&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The surgical team at Mott prepared for the procedure with the help of the SynCardia's medical representatives and Dr. David Morales, director of pediatric cardiothoracic surgery at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, who had successfully implanted total artificial hearts in other kids. U-M physicians Dr. Francis Pagani and Dr. Jonathan Haft, who had implanted the devices in adults, also assisted during the procedure, Lancaster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;They strategized about how they would get the large device into Lev'Veon's small chest, and how to connect the artificial heart to his vasculature so it would work properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The first step was removing the heart that was no longer beating inside of Lev'Veon and sewing connections into the cuffs of the right atrium, the left atrium, the aorta and the pulmonary artery, Lancaster said. They then connected the ventricles of the artificial heart to those cuffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"It really was like a complete replacement of what the normal heart anatomy is, just in an artificial way," Lancaster said. "The last part of the operation was transitioning from the heart-lung machine to the support of the total artificial heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We were holding out hope that it was going to work. And it actually was surprising ... how well it worked."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The final task was to determine how to close Lev'Veon's chest with the large artificial device inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We basically had to lasso the device around the ribs in Lev'Veon's left chest to kind of pull it out of the middle left chest in the space where the left lung sits, to close ... his breast bone, over top of the device," Lancaster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"With those maneuvers, we were able to get it closed that day in the operating room, which was awesome and unexpected. ... To be able to get it closed the first day reduces the chance of this device getting infected. If he had an infection in that device, then it's kind of game over after that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The artificial heart, he said, was attached with tubes to an external machine that used air pressure to force blood through Lev'Veon's body. When it's running, it's noisy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"It's like a very repetitive, rhythmic, loud pumping sound, and I think that the patient can feel that as well. I think it feels like they've got a motor, an engine, running in their chest," Lancaster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I spent the whole time feeling so bad for this boy because he went from being a normal kid sitting in his hospital room to waking up almost two weeks later with this kind of incessant device thumping away in his chest, which must have been terrifying. But he seemed to acclimate to it surprisingly well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When the Whites saw Lev'Veon again after the surgery, his artificial heart was beating, keeping him alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"He got all these tubes hooked up to this big machine and it's loud," White said. "So when you're walking down the hallway to get to his hospital room, you can hear it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But to her, it was the sound of hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;A donor comes through&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Doctors were thrilled to see Lev'Veon's health quickly improve with the total artificial heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"He was incredibly well supported ... much better than we had ever hoped he would be," Peng said. "We had originally even thought he needed a heart and kidney transplant, but his kidneys started perking up as soon as the total artificial heart was in and pumping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/25/PDTF/82656945007-david-ming-shen-peng-md.jpg?crop=1925,2622,x206,y243&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=409&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/25/PDTF/82656945007-david-ming-shen-peng-md.jpg?crop=1925,2622,x206,y243&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=818&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Dr. David Peng, director of pediatric heart failure and mechanical circulatory support at C.S.

She was at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"My boss actually took me home, and I went up to the hospital," she said.

"We thought there was a chance that he may need to go back on dialysis after the transplant and that his kidneys might not like another hit of being on the heart-lung machine. But he progressed beautifully after that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When Lev'Veon came out of the surgery, he was drowsy, White said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I said, 'Hey, baby,' and I gave him a hug," she said. "I told him. He did it. He's got a heart now and he was going to feel a lot better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And Lev'Veon did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He underwent physical therapy to rebuild the strength he lost during his long hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Remarkably, he trusted everyone, and he did everything he needed to do to recover," Peng said. "It took a few days for us to get the breathing tube out, and he patiently endured that, and then just step by step, he was able to work with us and and recover. He was remarkably calm and just an incredibly resilient kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"He was able to be discharged on Oct. 23. ... That's actually faster than most of our patients who go through transplant who hadn't received a total artificial heart. That's faster than average for us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On the day he left the hospital, his medical team and representatives from SynCardia gave him the mechanical heart that kept him alive inside a wooden display box along with a plaque and an Iron Man figurine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/25/PDTF/82656719007-lev-veons-new-heart.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=450&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/25/PDTF/82656719007-lev-veons-new-heart.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=900&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Lev'Veon Jones-White, 10, holds a case containing the total artificial heart that kept him alive until he could get a transplant at C.S.

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Some fear it is the first step in a move to cut or defund grants that involve the technology, which was an essential component in the rapid creation of vaccines against Covid-19, a major accomplishment of the first Trump term in fighting the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Messenger RNA technology, which in the case of Covid-19 teaches the body to fight infection by introducing immune cells to the coronavirus’s characteristic spike proteins, is being tested for use against diseases ranging from bird flu and dengue, to pancreatic cancer and melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While the NIH has not formally stated that it is cutting mRNA vaccine and therapy research, scientists who were interviewed by the Guardian said they have been told informally that the NIH is performing key word searches on grants that mention mRNA vaccine-related technology and related phrases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Colleagues have also been advised not to apply for mRNA vaccine grants. This is all through the grapevine. There has not been an official statement about it,” said one New York-based scientist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The NIH confirmed in a statement to the Guardian that it made a “data call” to learn more information about the funding of mRNA vaccine grants. Nature, the scientific journal, first reported the data call, and said it had been conducted by the acting NIH director Matthew Memoli on 6 March. Scientists were given one day to report the information, and NIH collected information about 130 mRNA grants as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Many of the scientists, public health experts and medical researchers interviewed by the Guardian spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing that they might be targeted if they expressed concerns publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One former senior NIH official who resigned recently said what was happening inside the organization was “not understandable”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“So far, any attempt at reasoning with people has fallen on deaf ears. Everything is being run by the department [Department of Health and Human Services] or the White House,” the person said. &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/nih-grants-mrna-vaccines-trump-administration-hhs-rfk/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/a&gt; separately reported that all grants involving mRNA research were to be reported to Memoli, for referral to the office of health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Adding to concerns is the administration’s February decision to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/trump-team-weighs-pulling-funding-for-moderna-bird-flu-vaccine?sref=fqqmZ8gi" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/hhs-moderna-vaccine-contract-bird-flu-pandemic-preparedness-worries/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;nearly $600m contract&lt;/a&gt; between HHS and Moderna, which was set to fund research into potential mRNA vaccines against five flu subtypes, including H5N1 or bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“mRNA has become the new four letter word. I mean, it’s crazy. It goes beyond just anti-vax,” the person said, referring to the anti-vaccine movement in the US. “It’s about anything associated with the Covid response, which has been weaponized by extreme people in the administration,” the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Paul Offit, director of the vaccine education center and an attending physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said he knew of one researcher working on mRNA technology who had their grants “flagged”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“That doesn’t necessarily mean they won’t get it, but it is worrisome that they might not get it,” he said. “There seems to be a war against mRNA technology. ‘Why?’ is the question.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Most experts agree that it relates to the politicization of the pandemic and misinformation about the Covid-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Prior to the pandemic, even anti-vaccine groups were not focused on mRNA vaccines,” said Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, an expert in vaccine law and professor at the University of California College of Law in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Most prominent among Trump’s vaccine skeptics is Kennedy, the recently confirmed head of HHS. Kennedy criticized mRNA vaccines while he led the anti-vaccine nonprofit Children’s Health Defense. In 2021, the group then led by Kennedy filed a petition to the FDA to revoke emergency approval of Covid-19 vaccines, “because the current risks of serious adverse events or deaths outweigh the benefits”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Studies later showed that claim was inaccurate. A&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/report-covid-19-vaccines-saved-us-115-trillion-3-million-lives" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; study by the Commonwealth Fund&lt;/a&gt; found that Covid-19 vaccines saved 3.2 million American lives and prevented more than 18 million hospitalizations through November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kennedy denied being anti-vaccine in Senate confirmation hearings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Others promoted into positions of power in the Trump administration also questioned Covid-19 strategies; Dr Jay Bhattacharya, who is expected to be confirmed as the new director of the NIH, and Martin Makary, who has just been confirmed as the new head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Jonathan Howard, a New York neurologist &lt;a href="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/questions/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;who closely tracked medical misinformation over the last four years, has been critical of both &lt;/a&gt;Bhattacharya and Makary, who Howard has alleged sought to try to convince people that the world overreacted to the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Bhattacharya was one of three authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, a statement that argued against Covid-19 lockdowns in favor of so-called herd immunity. Signed in October 2020 on the campus of the right-leaning American Institute for Economic Research, the declaration called for isolating the “old and infirm” and allowing people less vulnerable to death from Covid-19 to socialize.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  “Keeping [lockdown] measures in place until a vaccine is available will cause irreparable damage, with the underprivileged disproportionately harmed,” &lt;a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the declaration&lt;/a&gt; said. “Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  The statement was widely criticized for oversimplifying the protection of the vulnerable. Vaccines would become available just two months later, in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/01/covid-vaccines-healthcare-workers-first-cdc-panel" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;December 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In a post on X in June 2024, Bhattacharya said he would support pulling the regulatory authorization for the marketing of the Covid mRNA vaccines. While he said he initially hesitated to sign on to a petition calling for the move, he had been convinced that doing so would lead to “good clinical trial evidence testing” to check whether some patient groups still benefit from the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Makary is not anti-vaccine, but in June 2021 suggested parents should “think twice” before giving the Covid vaccine to healthy children. In an article he also said he was not aware of a single case of a healthy child who had died of Covid-19. Scientific studies at the time did, however, report that healthy children had died of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Three experts, including two who have closely monitored the growth of the anti-Covid vaccine movement in the US, said they believed that any opposition to mRNA-related research may influence others under the HHS umbrella, including the FDA, which regulates the approval of drugs and therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I am sure companies will continue to invest in mRNA research. The key will be whether the FDA will continue to approve mRNA vaccines,” said a former senior NIH official. “That to me is the big question because if there is a concerted effort to erase anything related to mRna vaccines, then obviously support for research is only one aspect. Hopefully, they are not going to do that, but I don’t have much hope for this crowd.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Another former senior official, who worked on the deployment of the Covid-19 vaccine during the Biden administration, said he had not seen any evidence to suggest that the FDA would take any unilateral position against approval of drugs and therapies that use mRNA technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The person pointed to the fact that Dr Peter Marks, who serves as the FDA’s center for biologics evaluation and research, which is responsible for assuring the safety and efficacy of products including vaccines, was still in his job. The former official said he believed Marks would, in effect, serve as a “guardrail” to protect the drug approval process against politicization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The Guardian asked the FDA about its position on reviewing mRNA vaccines, and whether its position was under review. The Guardian also asked the FDA to comment on concerns among scientists about whether such vaccines will continue to be given approval by the FDA. The FDA did not directly respond to the questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It said in a statement: “The FDA is a science-based regulatory agency that evaluates the safety and effectiveness of all products based upon data submitted by sponsors and the totality of the available scientific evidence … The decision to vaccinate is a personal one. People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The Guardian contacted Pfizer, Moderna, Merck and PhRMA, the drug industry’s lobbying group, to ask whether the Trump administration’s apparent mistrust of mRNA vaccines was an area of concern. None responded to the Guardian’s questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I don’t know when the shoe is going to drop. As a vaccine researcher we are all extremely nervous about what can happen to research funding,” said the New York scientist who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “There is no Plan B. It is economic madness as well as the elimination of a powerful technology against future pandemics. It is a freaking nightmare.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have a tip?

Many took advantage of the policy,  leaving the children in his practice well below the 95% threshold that experts say is needed to achieve herd immunity. In the end, a single measles case at the theme park spread to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/multi-state-outbreak.html" target="_blank"&gt;145 people across the country&lt;/a&gt;; several were part of his practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was traumatized,” said Ball. “I felt that like we didn’t do enough as a practice, and I didn’t do enough as a pediatrician, to convince families to get vaccinated.” Not only were the children of his anti-vaccine parents left vulnerable to the measles, but they had also exposed other children in his waiting room who couldn’t receive the vaccine because they were too young or immunocompromised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;

  &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Christina House/Los Angeles Times)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a doctor, Ball felt torn: He had a moral obligation to care for all his patients, regardless of their parent’s vaccine choices. But he also had a duty to protect his other patients, as well as the rest of the community, from a deadly virus that was almost entirely preventable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With another measles outbreak continuing to spread in Texas and New Mexico — bringing the first two U.S measles deaths in a decade — and eight cases already in California this year, physicians are again facing a moral quandary: Should they refuse to see families who don’t want to vaccinate their children, or keep them in their practices in the hopes of changing their minds? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt; &lt;div class="infobox" data-click="infoBox" data-module-id="00000190-e298-d747-a1f3-eadad3500002"&gt;       &lt;p class="infobox-description"&gt;Engage with our &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/early-childhood"&gt;community-funded journalism &lt;/a&gt;as we delve into child care, transitional kindergarten, health and other issues affecting children from birth through age 5.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Disneyland outbreak, the doctors at Ball’s practice decided to crack down. In 2015, they instituted a new policy: Southern Orange County Pediatric Associates would no longer accept patients who did not plan to immunize their children. Existing patients who didn’t want to vaccinate would need to find a new doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A growing trend of dismissing unvaccinated patients&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dismissal” policies were once discouraged by the medical establishment, both because pediatricians have a duty to care for all their young patients, and because some anti-vaccine parents can be convinced over time to change their minds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in 2016, the American Academy of Pediatrics  came up with new guidance:  Vaccines against preventable diseases like the measles were so important that if, after repeated attempts, a pediatrician couldn’t convince a parent to get their child immunized, a practice could righteously kick them out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that made a big difference to a lot of us. It gave us cover,” said Ball. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, dismissal policies have grown much more popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/153/3/e2023065483/196695/Strategies-for-Improving-Vaccine-Communication-and?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank"&gt;In 2013, some 21%&lt;/a&gt; of pediatricians reported that they often or always dismissed families who refused vaccination, according to a survey published &lt;a class="link" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/136/6/1103/33879/Characteristics-of-Physicians-Who-Dismiss-Families?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;in the journal Pediatrics. &lt;/a&gt;By 2019, the share had grown to 37%; the 2019 survey, published in the &lt;a class="link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2770611" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Assn.&lt;/a&gt;, also found that just over half of pediatricians said their office had a dismissal policy in place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For families that seek to spread out vaccines with an alternative schedule, dismissals are much less common: just 8% of individual pediatricians reported often or always dismissing these families, while 28% reported that their office has such a dismissal policy, &lt;a class="link" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/153/3/e2023065483/196695/Strategies-for-Improving-Vaccine-Communication-and?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank"&gt;according to the academy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dismissal policies are much more common among private practices. Academic medical institutions, including UCLA, large health systems like Kaiser Permanente, rural clinics and safety net systems for low-income patients generally accept all patients, regardless of whether the parents intend to vaccinate their children. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center is an exception and discourages pediatricians in their clinics from treating unvaccinated patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The question of whether to dismiss has become increasingly pressing amid growing anti-vaccine sentiment and a decline in coverage. The proportion of kindergartners nationwide who completed their measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine series &lt;a class="link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2831829?guestAccessKey=56e97a82-ade9-491f-abc4-36844563d19b&amp;amp;utm_source=silverchair&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article_alert-jama&amp;amp;utm_content=olf&amp;amp;utm_term=031725&amp;amp;adv=null" target="_blank"&gt;dropped from about 95% &lt;/a&gt;— the federal coverage target — before the pandemic to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;less than 93%&lt;/a&gt; last school year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In California, 96.2% of kindergartners were fully vaccinated against the measles in the 2023-24 school year, &lt;a class="link" href="https://latimes.com/california/story/2025-03-19/california-school-vaccines-measles-immunity" target="_blank"&gt;a slight decline&lt;/a&gt; from the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No matter what your policy, you feel ethically justified,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, who co-wrote the American Academy of Pediatrics’ latest guidance on vaccines. In January, the New England Journal of Medicine presented &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMclde2407983?logout=true" target="_blank"&gt;arguments on both sides&lt;/a&gt; of the debate, with O’Leary writing a statement in favor of accepting unvaccinated patients. “I personally understand both sides.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why doctors dismiss &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;vaccine-hesitant&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; families&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, many pediatric practices are upfront about their policies, and some announce it on their website, letting prospective patients know to stay away if they don’t want to vaccinate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Larchmont Pediatrics, for example, Dr. Neville Anderson requires all patients to be vaccinated. If parents refuse to vaccinate their infants after a final conversation at the 3-month visit, the practice sends them an official dismissal letter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-right&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;

  &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If a parent is truly anti-vax and does not want to vaccinate their child, our values and our goals and our beliefs are so antithetical to each other that we’re not a good team,” said Anderson. “I’m not the right doctor for them, and they’re not the right patient for me.” Larchmont dismisses only one to four patients each year, she said, since most anti-vaccine families know their reputation and tend to go elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for some patients, the dismissal policy is a real draw. “We get a lot of people who will come to us because we have this policy and we enforce it,” said Anderson. “They’re afraid of bringing their 7-month-old into a waiting room where there’s an unvaccinated child.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors should make every effort to convince a family to vaccinate before dismissing them, said Dr. Jesse Hackell, a retired pediatrician in New York who also co-wrote the pediatric academy’s report on improving vaccine communication. The problem, he said, is that these conversations are time-consuming and unpaid for busy pediatricians who often only have 20 minutes with a patient. “It’s frustrating, and it’s one of the issues that leads to moral injury and burnout.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hackell, 74, remembers a time before vaccination, when many of his young patients ended up hospitalized with measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases. “I don’t want to ever go back to those days of worrying about the 2 a.m. phone call about a kid with 105-degree fever. That’s that’s not good for me as a physician. It’s not good for the kid or the family.” His practice had a dismissal policy long before the pediatrics academy said it was acceptable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One ethical argument in favor of dismissing is based on parents having a moral obligation to vaccinate their children to reduce the risk of infecting others, said Dr. Doug Opel, a bioethicist and professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington School of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another point  is that “vaccination is viewed as a social contract,” he said. “So it’s not fair to share in the collective benefits of vaccination without accepting the small burdens of vaccination by getting your child vaccinated themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The moral case for accepting &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;vaccine-hesitant&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; families&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opel said that, as a bioethicist, he comes down on the side of keeping families in a practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In what other area of medicine even do we expect patients or parents to hold the same values and beliefs that we have?” he asked. “Instead, we approach differences with humility and respectfully explore those values as a way to find common ground and shared understanding.” Opel said about 30% of parents do end up changing their mind. “Vaccine hesitancy is a modifiable behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Leary said there is also little evidence that accepting unvaccinated children leads to the transmission of vaccine-preventable illnesses in an office setting. And it isn’t clear whether the threat of dismissal actually convinces parents to get vaccinated, or whether patients who get kicked out of a practice end up finding other sources of care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ln San Diego County, Children’s Primary Care Medical Group — a large practice with 28 offices in the region — has a policy of accepting all patients, regardless of vaccination status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The basic philosophy is it’s not the kids who refuse, it’s the parents. And we don’t punish kids for the decisions of the parents,” said Dr. Adam Breslow, the group’s president and CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 90% of the group’s patients are vaccinated on schedule, Breslow said. Of the 2-3% who refuse all vaccinations, most come from wealthier areas where parents can afford to homeschool or send their children to private school. He said it’s rare that he’s able to convince them to vaccinate in a single office visit, but over the course of several years in his practice, some parents do eventually change their minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By keeping them in the practice, there’s a chance they’re going to get vaccinated,” said O’Leary. “But if you kick them out, who knows what’s going to happen?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where do  parents &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;who don’t vaccinate kids &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;go?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widespread dismissal policies can make it difficult for vaccine-hesitant families to find regular sources of care. In local Facebook groups, parents often exchange tips about practices that are more tolerant of spreading out or refusing vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some advise using concierge practices, which charge thousands of dollars in annual fees on top of insurance payments but may allow more flexibility with vaccination schedules. Some of these practices offer  unproven alternatives to vaccination with little or no evidence to back them up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitney Jacks, a mother in Escondido, recently posted in a moms group on Facebook for help finding a new pediatrician who would accept her preference to limit vaccines. With her older child, who is 7, she used to pay for a concierge doctor in Maryland whom she saw over Zoom. But her son doesn’t have a regular pediatrician and therefore skips his annual well visits, though he does see a specialist several times a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now pregnant with her second child, she was hoping to find someone local who would accept her insurance and support her decision to wait until the baby turns 2 before starting vaccinating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other moms in the Facebook group were hesitant to share the names publicly for fear that the doctors could get into trouble, she said, preferring to direct message her instead. One mom sent her a list of names, which she used to set up meet-and-greet appointments with the four closest to her home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as she began to meet with them, one after another gave her the same response: “We won’t kick you out, but we don’t like this,” said Jacks, who is an acupuncturist. “So they’re already putting it at you that they disapprove of your point of view.” None made her feel welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She picked the most convenient office. But Jacks worries that every visit will focus on vaccination instead of other issues like feeding and sleeping that are important in the first years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t give me any confidence or faith in the provider.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article is part of The Times’ early childhood education initiative, focusing on the learning and development of California children from birth to age 5.

During this same period, California reported 1,566 infections, more than any other state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC issued a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/p0320-cauris.html" target="_blank"&gt;public safety announcement&lt;/a&gt; declaring &lt;i&gt;C. auris&lt;/i&gt; an “urgent threat” in 2023 because it is resistant to many antifungal drugs, spreads rapidly in healthcare facilities and can cause severe infections with high death rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The rapid rise and geographic spread of cases is concerning and emphasizes the need for continued surveillance, expanded lab capacity, quicker diagnostic tests, and adherence to proven infection prevention and control,” CDC epidemiologist Dr. Meghan Lyman said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, there are signs that the fungus is once again on the move. The Georgia Department of Public Health recently reported a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.wjcl.com/article/candida-auris-drug-resistant-fungus/64096081" target="_blank"&gt;surge in cases&lt;/a&gt; in healthcare facilities, and a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(25)00114-2/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; found an alarming rate of spread in Florida hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C. auris&lt;/i&gt; spreads through direct contact with colonized or infected individuals, contaminated surfaces and medical equipment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A colonized person has the fungus on their skin but does not experience symptoms. In an infected person, the fungus invades the body and causes symptoms such as fever, chills, sepsis and organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk of infection is especially high for patients with catheters, breathing tubes or feeding tubes because they create direct entry points for &lt;i&gt;C. auris&lt;/i&gt; to enter the bloodstream or lungs. Most healthy people are not at serious risk of complications from infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most of the patients that get infections with &lt;i&gt;Candida auris&lt;/i&gt; are themselves pretty sick to start with,” said Stuart Cohen, chief of infectious diseases at UC Davis. “This is something that can push  people over the edge and become life-threatening.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have found &lt;i&gt;C. auris&lt;/i&gt; infections have a &lt;a class="link" href="https://academic.oup.com/mmy/article/62/6/myae042/7700339?" target="_blank"&gt;mortality rate&lt;/a&gt; of 30% to 60%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent the spread of the disease, most California hospitals have implemented screening procedures for patients transferred from high-risk healthcare settings. Those found to have &lt;i&gt;C. auris &lt;/i&gt;are then isolated from the rest of the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The goal is, first and foremost, to keep the people in your hospital safe,” Cohen said. “When somebody comes in for a procedure, they’re not expecting to go home with a life-threatening illness or having spent time in an ICU from a hospital infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most common disinfectants do not kill &lt;i&gt;C. auris,&lt;/i&gt; which can live on surfaces for weeks. There are, however, specialized products that hospitals can use to eliminate the yeast. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 10:00:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizAFBVV95cUxNS0I3SHM1N1czQU5LaEgyamdxRm5NYW5ZanFHR3hwZlJabzN0MzNHWXdqUE9lXzdidzFSUTFMV1dqSEpaZVQyQ3c1RzdGV25KVDNWMG1LZmpPWmU1eGQ2U1VzS2xnZmdOajZfZmx6YzNyYmRFbXp2YzFDVXFrNXVTX3Z1MlVLM1NNV3NrRVdtdkNjbmtrNVktOTFCQkE1cFJSVVJxWklRd3ZlWXRPUUFCRF9yV3FNZjRSX2dNME9CTVBxdHlNelAtOU11Y3E</guid></item><item><title>What to Know About Adderall, Ritalin and Other Prescription Stimulants - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOeXdVOEM1OUFrbVVsampVUFl5dUlLVG0teGFmQmR6TkRDaEpTSDJvNjNKZ09WZU5teUhkdDBDRnNTWVV6VXlGWXQ1UTNPcFE5Qm9YRzJBc3VOMzNTeExVa2VVN3ZybjBUU3hoQXMwMjdLckJ6M3dqbWQzekRKazNCeU1lQTZkNFdtWWJnSWtFUnE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F.

The biggest drop (38%) was in riboflavin. The mineral density in wheat has also been &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" class="link " href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19013359/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dropping over the past 160 years;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;dropping over the past 160 years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The reason for this is complicated, but the basic takeaway is clear: This is not great for our health. “To get as many nutrients from our fruit and veggies as they did in the ‘70s and to hit our recommended daily consumption, we would need to consume seven to 10 servings a day,” &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" class="link " href="https://keatleymnt.com/nutrition-management-obesity-diabetes-heart-health-keatley-mnt/our-practitioners/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scott Keatley;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Scott Keatley&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian and co-owner of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" class="link " href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, tells Yahoo Life.

Here’s what’s behind this drop in nutrients, plus what you can do on a personal level to make up for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="why-are-fruits-and-vegetables-less-nutritious-than-they-used-to-be"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are fruits and vegetables less nutritious than they used to be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are likely a few things at play here, but a drop in soil health is a big factor, food scientist &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://abbeythefoodscientist.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Abbey Thiel;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Abbey Thiel&lt;/a&gt;, tells Yahoo Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Like us, plants need key nutrients to grow and be healthy,” she explains. Most of a plant's nutrients come from its soil and surrounding environment. But as the nutrients become used up and levels of pollution increase, the plant doesn’t have the best growth conditions. “In the end, this means the plants we eat are also less nutritious,” Thiel says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This phenomenon is called “nutrient dilution,” and Avena says it’s a growing concern in the fields of agriculture and public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But the soil didn’t just magically become less healthy on its own. Avena explains that intensive farming practices, including monocropping (growing one type of crop) and the heavy use of synthetic fertilizers, can deplete essential minerals in the soil. Nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur in particular tend to be victims of this, says Thiel. “If these nutrients aren’t replenished, crops grown in the same soil over time will have lower mineral content,” Avena says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The crops themselves are also not designed to be as nutritionally robust as they used to be. “Modern crops are often bred for higher yields, pest resistance and faster growth, sometimes at the expense of nutrient density,” Avena says. “A plant that grows faster may accumulate less nutrition per unit of weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(24)00112-5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" class="link " href="https://magazine.publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/less-nutritious-crops-another-result-rising-co2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rising carbon dioxide levels;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;rising carbon dioxide levels&lt;/a&gt; can increase carbohydrate content in plants, such as sugars and starches, while diluting key nutrients like zinc and iron, says Avena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even the way crops are harvested can affect their nutritional value. She explains that storage and transportation methods can degrade certain nutrients, particularly heat-sensitive ones like vitamin C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="is-all-produce-impacted"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is all produce affected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Certain types of produce are affected by the loss of nutrients more than others. For example, fruits and root vegetables, which tend to grow more slowly, may be affected less. Instead, declines are seen more consistently in fast-growing, high-yield crops such as wheat, corn and green vegetables like spinach and lettuce, says Avena. “Additionally, crops that are heavily processed or stored for long periods before consumption tend to lose more nutrients,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Something else to consider, according to Thiel: This goes beyond just fruits and vegetables. “We eat a lot of other plant-based foods like grains, legumes and herbs,” she says. “It really will depend on how the food is grown, where it is grown and how well the soil was taken care of.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-fruits-and-vegetables"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get the most out of your fruits and vegetables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Shunning fruits and vegetables isn’t the way to go however. Instead, experts recommend doing your best to load your plate with a variety of produce to try to get in a slew of nutrients. “It's easier to consume fruits and vegetables in the U.S. than ever before,” Keatley says. “We have fresh, frozen, canned and dried produce, all at our fingertips.” He suggests mixing things up, like having berries in the morning, carrots and an apple as a snack, a salad with lunch that has lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers, as well as roasted veggies with sauteed greens with dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some good news: Fiber content in food seems to be consistent, and water content has increased. “If you're consuming seven to 10 servings of fruit and vegetables," says Keatley, "you're getting very close to hitting fiber goals for the day and are helping your body to stay hydrated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you really want to maximize your nutritional intake from the produce you eat, Avena recommends taking these steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick heirloom and organic varieties, if you can afford it.&lt;/strong&gt; “Traditional plant varieties tend to be more nutrient-dense compared to high-yield commercial crops,” she says. “Organic farming practices also promote healthier soil.” The downside is these tend to be more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on local and seasonal produce.&lt;/strong&gt; “Nutrients degrade over time, so buying freshly harvested, locally grown produce reduces nutrient loss from storage and transport,” Avena says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support companies focused on regenerative agriculture.&lt;/strong&gt; “Practices like crop rotation, composting and reduced tillage help restore soil nutrients, leading to healthier crops,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a range of fruits and vegetables.&lt;/strong&gt; This raises the odds you’ll take in a broader amount of essential nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think about how you store and cook produce.&lt;/strong&gt; Minimizing cooking time (e.g., steaming instead of boiling, and consuming raw produce when appropriate) can help retain vitamins, Avena says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Ultimately, what matters most is that you continue to consume plenty of fruits and vegetables,” &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" class="link " href="https://kerigansny.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keri Gans;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Keri Gans&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian and the author of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" class="link " href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/small-change-diet-10-steps-to-a-thinner-healthier-you-keri-gans/7060012" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Small Change Diet;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Small Change Diet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, tells Yahoo Life&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;“Despite any potential decline in soil quality, fruits and vegetables still provide essential nutrients for our health, including vitamins C, E and A, potassium and fiber.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" class="link " href="https://jessicacordingnutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jessica Cording;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Jessica Cording&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian and author of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-little-book-of-game-changers-jessica-cording-ms-rd-cdn/1130737371" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Little Book of Game Changers;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game Changers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, agrees.

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;Confirmed cases of measles in the D.C. region, the most recent being in the nation’s capital, have led to many questions for doctors. The questions about the illness are coming from not only those not vaccinated for the illness, but those who are, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do get a lot of questions about measles,” said Dr. Gabrina Dixon, a pediatrician at Children’s National Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
                 
 &lt;div class="wtop_faqs"&gt;&lt;ul class="faq faq_0"&gt;&lt;li class="question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;How effective is the measles vaccine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;With each confirmed case of the illness, your local health department will likely send out locations where the person was, to warn against possible points of exposure for others. That leads to questions about how protected someone is if they’ve received the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After one shot of the vaccine, you’re 93% protected against measles. After the second shot, you are 97% protected,” Dixon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the vaccine results in lifelong protection from the illness, according to Dixon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="faq faq_1"&gt;&lt;li class="question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;When is the right time to get vaccinated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;The vaccine, according to Dixon, is usually given to children between 12 and 15 months old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With most schools requiring the vaccine, most people born after 1968 have been vaccinated. People born between 1957 and 1968 may need to be tested for protection, because during that period some vaccines did not contain the “live attenuated virus,” Dixon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="faq faq_2"&gt;&lt;li class="question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;Can someone who is vaccinated catch the measles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dixon said while the vaccine is effective for people with a strong immune system, those who may be immunocompromised could be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When that immune system is weakened due to a condition, maybe due to medications, that is where we can see it pop up,” Dixon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who have weakened immune systems should talk to their doctor if they believe they were exposed to the illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="faq faq_3"&gt;&lt;li class="question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;How contagious is measles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles is very, very contagious, according to Dixon, which is why she advocates for getting vaccinated against the illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you have a room of 10 people breathing the same air in the same room, and one of those persons gets measles, it’ll spread to nine out of the 10 people,” Dixon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dixon said this fact has led to the high spread seen in communities of people who are unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="faq faq_4"&gt;&lt;li class="question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;How long does it take for symptoms to appear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dixon said symptoms of measles can set in anywhere from 72 hours to two weeks after exposure, which is why doctors encourage monitoring for the illness for up to two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You start seeing signs like fever, cough, runny nose. But, again, for some people, it can take up to a week or two, but usually after 72 hours of exposure, you may start seeing symptoms,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="faq faq_5"&gt;&lt;li class="question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;Can measles look like other illnesses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dixon said the answer is yes, because the illness in many cases starts out like a common cold, with symptoms like a fever, runny nose or cough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The telltale sign of measles is this rash, but that rash comes later, and again, you’re already contagious before you get this rash,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles can also be confused for allergies during allergy season, as it can bring on itchy or watery eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="faq faq_6"&gt;&lt;li class="question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is there a treatment for measles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no treatment for measles, according to Dixon, so all doctors can do is provide supportive care to patients with the illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some people, unfortunately, can succumb to measles. It can lead to death, because again, there is no treatment for measles,” Dixon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="faq faq_7"&gt;&lt;li class="question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;What if I am unsure if I am vaccinated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adults can be tested to see if they are protected against the illness; and if they are not, a doctor can administer the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want you to get protected. Go get vaccinated if you haven’t done so already,” Dixon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;p class="After-content"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As we get older, the essential cleaning processes that our brains need to keep functioning start to break down and fail. In new research, scientists have figured out how to boost waste removal cycles in the brains of mice – with dramatic effects &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-prescription-drug-appears-to-recover-lost-memories-in-mice"&gt;on their memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from Washington University in St. Louis, the research focuses on vessels around the brain called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningeal_lymphatic_vessels"&gt;meningeal lymphatics&lt;/a&gt;, the brain cleaners in chief. These vessels are part of the larger lymphatic system in the body, responsible for waste disposal and helping the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a targeted protein treatment on older mice to help these meningeal lymphatics grow and operate. In subsequent experiments, the treated mice were shown to have improved memory function compared to untreated animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156048" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156048" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/VesselsDiagram.jpg" alt="Brain waste removal diagram" class="wp-image-156048 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/VesselsDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/VesselsDiagram-383x415.jpg 383w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/VesselsDiagram-600x650.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156048" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at meningeal lymphatics and their waste removal, and microglia immune cells. (Kim et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a clear link to neurodegenerative conditions &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;like Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; here, conditions in which aging brains lose memory functions and cognitive abilities. This new work could potentially offer some clues as to how to slow down or prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A functioning lymphatic system is critical for brain health and memory," &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/boosting-brains-waste-removal-system-improves-memory-in-old-mice/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Kyungdeok Kim, from Washington University in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Therapies that support the health of the body's waste management system may have health benefits for a naturally aging brain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also discovered that the protein interleukin 6 is used as a kind of distress signal by overwhelmed immune cells called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microglia"&gt;microglia&lt;/a&gt; – a distress signal that's sent out when the brain's cleaning apparatus gets overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as boosting the mice's memory, the lymphatics treatment reduced interleukin 6 levels, restoring order to this part of the immune system and preventing some of the damage in the brain caused by stressed microglia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important aspect of the research: the meningeal lymphatic vessels are just outside the brain, so they can be targeted without the complexity of having to get through the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; that helps keep the brain protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The physical blood-brain barrier hinders the efficacy of therapies for neurological disorders," &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/boosting-brains-waste-removal-system-improves-memory-in-old-mice/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Jonathan Kipnis, from Washington University in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By targeting a network of vessels outside of the brain that is critical for brain health, we see cognitive improvements in mice, opening a window to develop more powerful therapies to prevent or delay cognitive decline."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all important insights into how normal brain communication networks get disrupted when toxic material isn't cleared away, and allowed to build up. It's not unlike trash building up on railway lines and stopping trains from traveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings fit in neatly with previous research too, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-rejuvenate-the-memories-of-elderly-mice-by-injecting-them-with-young-mouse-cerebrospinal-fluid"&gt;a 2022 study&lt;/a&gt; in which mouse memories were boosted through injections of cerebrospinal fluid – the same fluid meningeal lymphatic vessels clean waste from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We may not be able to revive neurons, but we may be able to ensure their most optimal functioning through modulation of meningeal lymphatic vessels," &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/boosting-brains-waste-removal-system-improves-memory-in-old-mice/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Kipnis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)00210-7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

As an adult, there’s no set rule that states that one has to go to bed by this time. And that sort of has messed our sleeping schedules up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the most common pattern we’ve acquired is putting our electronic gadgets away around midnight and then going to bed past midnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it’s been fairly established that sleeping too late isn’t good for one’s overall health, recent research sheds some light upon the vital question - how bad is it if you don’t hit the bed until the clock strikes 12?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleeping past midnight?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s address the elephant in the room in case you’re going to bed past midnight - it’s not great news, healthwise, buddy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2831009" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;A study recently published in JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; analyzed data from nearly 1,200 people and found that those who consistently fell asleep after midnight had higher glycemic variability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Now, what is glycemic variability?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glycemic variability (GV) refers to fluctuations or swings in blood glucose levels, encompassing both short-term (within-day and between-day) and long-term (serial measurements over time) variations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors pointed out that glycemic variability is a risk factor for chronic disease and early death, which makes it reasonable to wonder if going to bed after midnight puts you at risk for those bad outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, falling asleep past midnight can affect your mental health as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165178124002415" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;A 2024 study published in the journal Psychiatric Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that people who go to bed after 1 a.m. were at a higher risk of having depression and generalized anxiety disorder, regardless of whether they identified as being a morning person or night owl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07420528.2018.1454458" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Some older research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; also links going to bed late and struggling to wake up in the morning to having a shorter lifespan, along with a higher risk of health complications like diabetes and psychological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens to your body if you sleep past midnight?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, that question doesn’t have a linear or an objective answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everybody has a unique sleep schedule and sleeping pattern that they’re used to. If you’re someone who hits the bed quite late at night but sleeps till late morning, completing your 7-8 hours of sleep, your bedtime is unlikely to be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jade Wu, a behavioral sleep medicine specialist and author of Hello Sleep: The Science and Art of Overcoming Insomnia Without Medications, told Yahoo Life. “There is nothing magical about midnight.” But Wu said that going to bed after midnight depends on several factors, including your chronotype (i.e., your biologically hardwired body clock), when you get up in the morning, how much sleep you need, what you do during the day and evening and how consistent your sleep timing is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu also recommended keeping this in mind when it comes to midnight bedtimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per her, “When a research study shows harmful associations with going to bed after midnight, it's not because midnight is a special time, but because when you do a research study and ask people about their sleep habits, you have to categorize their answers somehow. If, on average, people are healthier and happier when they consistently go to bed before midnight, it's likely because people, on average, need to get up early enough for work/family that routinely going to bed after midnight means they routinely don't get enough sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as per Dr. Beth Malow, director of the Vanderbilt Sleep Division at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, going to bed after midnight often suggests that you may be less likely to be getting enough sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Malow told Yahoo Life that it also means you may be messing with your circadian rhythm, which is your body’s natural 24-hour cycle, she adds. Your circadian rhythm helps regulate multiple physiological and behavioral processes in your body, including signaling to your body that it’s time to wake up or wind down for bed, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per Malow, “Our natural circadian rhythms usually have us going to bed earlier, before midnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Effects of erratic sleep schedules on health:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going to bed past midnight here and there can mess with your health as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per Christopher Winter, a neurologist and sleep medicine specialist with Charlottesville Neurology and Sleep Medicine in Virginia, and the host of the Sleep Unplugged podcast, told Yahoo Life that falling asleep past midnight if you typically go to bed around 10 p.m. may mean that you don’t get as much deep sleep as you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per Winter, “Deep sleep happens predominantly in that first one to two hours. So, for the average sleeper, that’s probably 10 p.m. to 12 a.m. Going to bed after midnight means missing out on the bulk of deep sleep/slow wave sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Winter, this phase of sleep is when growth hormone and other chemicals are secreted — missing out can inhibit those and increase levels of the stress hormone cortisol. As per him, “Both negatively affect blood sugar and mood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to move up your bedtime:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you consistently go to bed at midnight or even later, but you don’t have to be up early the next morning, your standard bedtime may not be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hwoever, if you feel like you have trouble going to bed before midnight and you have to be somewhere in the morning, sleep specialists say there are a few things you can do to try to move up your bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To boost your bedtime and improve sleep, create a relaxing pre-sleep routine, optimize your sleep environment, manage stress, and limit screen time before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Establish a Relaxing Bedtime Routine:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Wind-down activities:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Engage in calming activities like reading a physical book, taking a warm bath, listening to soothing music or a podcast, or practicing meditation or deep breathing exercises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Avoid screens:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Limit exposure to electronic devices (phones, tablets, computers) at least an hour before bed, as the blue light emitted can interfere with melatonin production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Create a comfortable environment:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ensure your bedroom is cool, dark, and quiet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Consider a sleep-inducing snack:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you're hungry, opt for a light, healthy snack like a piece of fruit, yogurt, or a few nuts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Warm Milk:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some people find that drinking warm milk before bed can help them relax and fall asleep more easily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Optimize Your Sleep Environment:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Darkness:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Use blackout curtains or an eye mask to block out any light that might disrupt your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Temperature:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Keep your bedroom cool, ideally around 60-67°F (15-19°C).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Noise:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Minimize noise distractions with earplugs or a white noise machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Comfort:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ensure your mattress, pillows, and bedding are comfortable and supportive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Manage Stress and Worries:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Address worries:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Try to resolve any pressing concerns before bedtime, or write them down to set them aside for the next day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Practice relaxation techniques:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Engage in activities that promote relaxation, such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; These substances can interfere with sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Regular exercise:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Engage in regular physical activity, but avoid strenuous workouts close to bedtime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Other Tips:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Stick to a consistent sleep schedule:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go to bed and wake up around the same time each day, even on weekends, to regulate your body's natural sleep-wake cycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Get sunlight exposure:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aim for morning sunlight, which helps regulate your circadian rhythm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Limit daytime naps:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you do nap, keep it short (around 20 minutes) and avoid napping too late in the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Eat a balanced diet:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Avoid heavy or spicy meals close to bedtime, as they can disrupt sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Consider sleep-related supplements:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you are struggling with sleep, consider talking to your doctor about melatonin or other sleep-related supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Consult a doctor:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;

						A fox that attacked a 9-year-old boy and two dogs in Dedham, Massachusetts, has tested positive for rabies, the town's animal control department confirmed Wednesday. The attack happened on Sunday afternoon in the area of Sandy Valley Road in Dedham. The boy, Patrick Morrison, was playing in his front yard when he says the animal attacked."It appeared out of nowhere from around the corner," Morrison said. "The fox attacked me. I tried to run away from it and kick it away, but it just kept running back at me."Morrison's older brother, Michael, witnessed the attack. "I saw him running and screaming," Michael said. "I was like, oh my God."Neighbors were able to come by and scare the fox away."It was like running right behind him, and then he turned onto the lawn, and then it jumped up and grabbed his arm, and it got him right there," Michael said. "He has a couple scratches on his butt."As a result of the attack, Morrison went to the hospital and received a series of rabies shots. "I had to go to the hospital, two hours in the emergency room," Morrison said. "Rabies shots here and two shots I don’t know about right here in my legs."Despite the scary attack, Morrison says he's doing much better. "I'm doing OK now. Scared when it happened," Morrison said.Both dogs injured in the attack received the necessary post-exposure prophylaxis, animal control confirmed.Anyone who has had contact with the fox should call the Massachusetts Department of Public Health at 617-983-6800 or their health care provider for a risk assessment. Owners of pets that may have had contact with the fox should also contact their veterinarian for a potential booster rabies shot.

The statement did not include information about identity of the recipient or the type of organ that was transplanted. The donor was not a resident of Michigan or Ohio, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Sutfin said the Michigan and Ohio health departments "worked closely" together and with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the investigation into the patient's death. The CDC's Rabies Laboratory confirmed the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"Health officials worked together to ensure that people, including health care providers, who were in contact with the Michigan individual were assessed for possible exposure to rabies," the statement added. "Post exposure preventive care, if appropriate, has been provided."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The department declined to provide NBC News with additional information. Ohio’s Health Department and the CDC did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Rabies can spread to humans if they come into contact with saliva or blood from infected animals, such as bats, raccoons, skunks or stray dogs. It is not always clear right away that a person has contracted rabies, as the initial symptoms are similar to those of the flu, including fever, headache and nausea. As the illness progresses, patients then experience difficulty swallowing, excessive salivation and hallucinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;If a person does not seek medical care quickly after having been scratched or bitten by a potentially infected animal, rabies is fatal.

The statement did not include information about identity of the recipient or the type of organ that was transplanted. The donor was not a resident of Michigan or Ohio, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Sutfin said the Michigan and Ohio health departments "worked closely" together and with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the investigation into the patient's death. The CDC's Rabies Laboratory confirmed the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"Health officials worked together to ensure that people, including health care providers, who were in contact with the Michigan individual were assessed for possible exposure to rabies," the statement added. "Post exposure preventive care, if appropriate, has been provided."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The department declined to provide NBC News with additional information.

It is not always clear right away that a person has contracted rabies, as the initial symptoms are similar to those of the flu, including fever, headache and nausea. As the illness progresses, patients then experience difficulty swallowing, excessive salivation and hallucinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;If a person does not seek medical care quickly after having been scratched or bitten by a potentially infected animal, rabies is fatal.

    &lt;p&gt;Jason, a 42-year-old father of two, has been battling back pain for weeks. Scrolling through his phone, he sees ad after ad promising relief: chiropractic alignments, acupuncture, back braces, vibrating massage guns and herbal patches. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His GP told him to “stay active”, but what does that even mean when every movement hurts? Jason wants to avoid strong painkillers and surgery, but with so many options (and opinions), it’s hard to know what works and what’s just marketing hype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Jason’s experience sounds familiar, you’re not alone. Back pain is one of the most common reasons people visit a doctor. It can be challenging to manage, mainly due to widespread &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/having-good-posture-doesnt-prevent-back-pain-and-bad-posture-doesnt-cause-it-183732"&gt;misunderstandings&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/02/bmjebm-2024-112974"&gt;overwhelming number&lt;/a&gt; of ineffective and uncertain treatments promoted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We assessed the best available evidence of non-drug and non-surgical treatments to alleviate low back pain. &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD014691.pub2/full"&gt;Our review&lt;/a&gt; – published today by the independent, international group the Cochrane Collaboration – includes 31 Cochrane systematic reviews, covering 97,000 people with back pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD014691.pub2/full"&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; bed rest doesn’t work for back pain. Some of the treatments that do work can depend on how long you’ve been in pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="Tweet" data-react-props='{"tweetId":"1674277915549130755"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is back pain likely to be serious?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different types of low back pain. It can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be short-lived, lasting less than six weeks (acute back pain) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;linger for a bit longer, for six to twelve weeks (sub-acute) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stick around for months and even years (chronic, defined as more than 12 weeks). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(16)30970-9/abstract"&gt;most cases&lt;/a&gt; (90-95%), back pain is non-specific and cannot be reliably linked to a specific cause or underlying disease. This includes common structural changes seen in x-rays and MRIs of the spine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, imaging of the back is &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60172-0/abstract"&gt;only&lt;/a&gt; recommended in rare situations – typically when there’s a clear suspicion of serious back issues, such as after physical trauma or when there is numbness or loss of sensation in the groin or legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people expect to receive &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD013815.pub2/full"&gt;painkillers&lt;/a&gt; for their back pain or even surgery, but these are no longer the front-line treatment options due to limited benefits and the high risk of harm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)30489-6/fulltext"&gt;clinical guidelines&lt;/a&gt; recommend people choose non-drug and non-surgical treatments to relieve their pain, improve function and reduce the distress commonly associated with back pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what works for different types of pain? Here’s what &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD014691.pub2/full"&gt;our review found&lt;/a&gt; when researchers compared these treatments with standard care (the typical treatment patients usually receive) or no treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What helps for short-term back pain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Stay active – don’t rest in bed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your back pain is new, the best advice is also one of the simplest: keep moving despite the pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing the way you move and use your body to protect it, or resting in bed, can seem like to right way to respond to pain – and may have even been recommended in the past. But we know know this excessive protective behaviour can make it harder to return to meaningful activities.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean pushing through pain or hitting the gym, but instead, trying to maintain your usual routines as much as possible. Evidence suggests that doing so won’t make your pain worse, and may improve it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="Tweet" data-react-props='{"tweetId":"1759745270395416621"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Multidisciplinary care, if pain lingers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For pain lasting six to 12 weeks, multidisciplinary treatment is likely to reduce pain compared to standard care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This involves a coordinated team of doctors, physiotherapists and psychologists working together to address the many factors contributing to your back pain persisting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;neurophysiological influences refer to how your nervous system is currently processing pain. It can make you more sensitive to signals from movements, thoughts, feelings and environment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;psychological factors include how your thoughts, feelings and behaviours affect your pain system and, ultimately, the experience of pain you have&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;occupational factors include the physical demands of your job and how well you can manage them, as well as aspects like low job satisfaction, all of which can contribute to ongoing pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;It’s important to keep up your normal routines when you have low back pain.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/woman-walking-on-asphalt-road-hqaDFFsCJgE"&gt;Raychan/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What works for chronic back pain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once pain has been around for more than 12 weeks, it can become more difficult to treat. But relief is still possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise therapy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise – especially programs tailored to your needs and preferences – is likely to reduce pain and help you move better. This could include aerobic activity, strength training or Pilates-based movements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t seem to matter what type of exercise you do – it matters more that you are consistent and have the right level of supervision, especially early on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multidisciplinary treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with short-term pain, coordinated care involving a mix of physical, occupational and psychological approaches likely works better than usual care alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychological therapies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychological therapies for chronic pain include approaches to help people change thinking, feelings, behaviours and reactions that might sustain persistent pain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These approaches are likely to reduce pain, though they may not be as effective in improving physical function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acupuncture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture probably reduces pain and improves how well you can function compared to placebo or no treatment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some debate remains about how it works, the evidence suggests potential benefits for some people with chronic back pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Some people may find relief from accupuncture.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/person-holding-silver-and-white-pen-QgcdtM9rA5s"&gt;Katherine Hanlon/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What doesn’t work or still raises uncertainty?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review found that many commonly advertised treatments still have uncertain benefits or probably do not benefit people with back pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spinal manipulation, for example, has uncertain benefits in acute and chronic back pain, and it likely does not improve how well you function if you have acute back pain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traction, which involves stretching the spine using weights or pulleys, probably doesn’t help with chronic back pain. Despite its popularity in some circles, there’s little evidence that it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn’t enough reliable data to determine whether advertised treatments – such back braces, vibrating massage guns and herbal patches – are effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How can you use the findings?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have back pain, start by considering how long you’ve had it. Then explore treatment options that research supports and discuss them with your GP, psychologist or physiotherapist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your health provider should reassure you about the importance of gradually increasing your activity to resume meaningful work, social and life activities. They should also support you in making informed decisions about which treatments are most appropriate for you at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

Only two of those infected are over the age of 18, according to state records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In several of the affected counties, rates of vaccination against MMR are lower than the 95% threshold believed to confer community protection. Rates are 82% in Morton County, 83% in Stevens County, 58% in Haskell County and 66% in Gray County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Due to the highly contagious nature of measles, additional cases are likely to occur within the current outbreak area and the surrounding counties, especially among those who are unvaccinated," said Kansas health department spokeswoman Jill Bronaugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RELATED STORY | &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/health/measles-case-reported-in-d-c-possible-exposure-on-amtrak-train" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Measles case reported in D.C., possible exposure on Amtrak train&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, an outbreak has grown to 10 known cases in Ashtabula County in Ohio.

A New Study Explains The Link. - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxPR2VHa1B5QTFVZG1JQll2WXE4X2pkSDdCeTRlTmVaNmt0T3l3cUxVeEptaTRPTnNSQUFEdzhHVm1veG9oZU5tc0xkbEVWR0Q0VWlETW0tLWZUaktwd3BWaGNpaC0zdFNibU1RRG1fQWMwWEI2ZThOcGM4MS1GdGpfbVdqZ3VRQjVyQWNuMkNVb1RLeWV2UElscnBjQzhmUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;People who are late to rise and late to sleep are at higher risk for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="155598" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. A new study from University of Surrey scientists has gotten us closer to understanding why  – and what we can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study determined the chronotype – a term used to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-say-there-are-6-human-chronotypes-not-just-morning-people-and-night-owls"&gt;categorize the variations&lt;/a&gt; that people's natural sleep-wake cycles can take – of 546 undergraduate students in an online questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"A late chronotype – also known as 'eveningness' or being a 'night owl' – is a biological tendency to prefer to be active in the evening, and sleep and wake up later," neuroscientist Simon Evans &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/night-owl-chronotype-depression"&gt;told BBC&lt;em&gt; Science Focus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; "Chronotype has a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-genes-that-may-control-whether-you-re-a-morning-or-night-person"&gt;genetic basis&lt;/a&gt;, so being a night owl is a natural biological tendency."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155649" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155649" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/fixed_typo_chronotypes_chart.jpg" alt="chart shows alertness level for six chronotypes, including morning, evening, highly active, daytime sleepy, daytime, and moderately active." class="wp-image-155649 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/fixed_typo_chronotypes_chart.jpg 1440w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/fixed_typo_chronotypes_chart-642x440.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/fixed_typo_chronotypes_chart-606x415.jpg 606w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/fixed_typo_chronotypes_chart-768x526.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/fixed_typo_chronotypes_chart-600x411.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155649" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;While the newest study included only three chronotypes, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-say-there-are-6-human-chronotypes-not-just-morning-people-and-night-owls"&gt;other research&lt;/a&gt; has identified six. (RUDN University)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 38 of the participants were actually deemed 'early birds', exhibiting a morning chronotype. Eveningness accounted for 252 participants, while the remaining 256 were classified as having an intermediate sleep-wake cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the average age of participants was around 20 years old, this distribution of chronotypes was no surprise: people at the end of their teen years tend to fall into the evening chronotype, while 'morningness' tends to prevail &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-to-figure-out-how-much-sleep-you-really-need"&gt;later in life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants also answered questions on subjective sleep quality, rumination (the tendency to dwell on negative feelings and thoughts), depression, mindfulness, and alcohol use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2021.114438"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2017.04.021"&gt;already linked&lt;/a&gt; the late chronotype with risk of serious depression symptoms, and this study corroborates it further, finding evening types had significantly higher depressive symptoms than their intermediate-type peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be that depression pushes a late chronotype – making it more difficult to find the motivation to get out of bed in the morning, and harder to relax into sleep at the end of the day amid a flow of negative thoughts. The study did find that evening types reported significantly higher levels of rumination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or perhaps the demands of work, study, and social life are depriving these night owls of sleep, forcing them to rise &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mastering-your-bodys-internal-clock-could-be-the-key-to-success"&gt;against their nature&lt;/a&gt;, demanding an earlier bedtime than the body will co-operate with. This state of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/07420520500545979"&gt;perpetual social jetlag&lt;/a&gt; and sleep debt may eventually wear down a person's mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, further statistical analysis suggests there are ways to mitigate the link between depression risk and chronotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness qualities – in particular, 'acting with awareness' (the ability to be non-judgmental of thoughts and feelings regardless of whether they are positive or negative), and 'describing' (the ability to label emotions and thoughts) – had significant indirect effects on the link between depression and eveningness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Acting with awareness' was a significant feature among early risers, who actually scored quite low on the other mindfulness measures. Perhaps this is the secret to the pep in their step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But this is again linked to sleep quality, as better sleep lowers risk of fatigue, inattention, and mind wandering, allowing people the ability to better focus on the present.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption was also a significant mediating factor. Night owls had a tendency to drink more alcohol overall, but while booze is a known depression risk factor, in this study the evening types generally drank in moderation, and doing so actually reduced their depression risk score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors speculate that maybe these students were benefitting from the social connections that can come with bonding over a bev, since their intake seemed generally too low to be having a serious negative impact on mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our research shows that strategies to foster higher mindfulness – such as guided meditation and mindfulness exercises – would be useful, as well as focusing on having better sleep quality, and trying to lower alcohol use," Evans &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/night-owl-chronotype-depression"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the BBC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;The current results indicate that enhancing the 'acting with awareness' facet of mindfulness should be prioritized in the design of mindfulness interventions, to maximize efficacy," the authors &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0319915"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319915"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qj34s700003b5vzmnirdas@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors treating people hospitalized as part of a measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico have also found themselves facing another problem: vitamin A toxicity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001k3b5vzzwah72n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, near the outbreak’s epicenter, several patients have been found to have abnormal liver function on routine lab tests, a probable sign that they’ve taken too much of the vitamin, according to Dr. Lara Johnson, pediatric hospitalist and chief medical officer for Covenant Health-Lubbock Service Area.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001l3b5ven91tduv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The hospitalized children with the toxicity were all unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001m3b5v9umqsj4m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy has centered his response to the outbreak on vitamin A, even suggesting in a Fox News interview that it could work “as a prophylaxis.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qkd5p100013b6mudx7nw30@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But overuse of vitamin A can have serious health consequences, and there is no evidence that it can prevent measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qkdtes00043b6mvg5xk0y6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The only way to prevent infection with the measles virus is through the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is 97% effective against measles after two doses. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/12/health/measles-rfk-vaccine-immunity/index.html"&gt;Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; has said that he does “encourage” vaccination but that it is a “personal choice.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001o3b5v57pcx0lk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If people have the mistaken impression that you have an either-or choice of MMR vaccine or vitamin A, you’re going to get a lot of kids unnecessarily infected with measles. That’s a problem, especially during an epidemic,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine. “And second, you have this unregulated medicine in terms of doses being given and potential toxicities.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001p3b5vsx0xfbha@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In specific doses taken under the care of a physician, vitamin A can play a role in treatment for measles. That’s why the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; recommend it in serious cases. But the patients who were reported to have toxicity were probably not taking the vitamin under the supervision of a physician, Johnson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001q3b5vmmo3s2ju@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vitamin A is most useful for measles support in people who have a specific deficiency, and studies suggesting its use mainly draw on evidence from low-income countries where that deficiency is common. The patients in West Texas are generally well-nourished, said Dr. Lesley Motheral, a pediatrician in Lubbock, so experts say it’s unclear how beneficial the vitamin might be in this setting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001r3b5vuqi9a2kr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vitamin A has an important role in &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-vitamin-a/art-20365945" target="_blank"&gt;immunity&lt;/a&gt; and vision. It’s fat-soluble, so when someone takes too much, it can &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;accumulate&lt;/a&gt; in organs like the liver. &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-vitamin-a/art-20365945" target="_blank"&gt;Excess vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; can cause dry skin and eyes, blurry vision, bone thinning, skin irritation, liver damage and other serious issues. In pregnant women, excess vitamin A can lead to birth defects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001s3b5vr635w23f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients with toxicity can receive supportive care like fluids for low blood pressure or moisturizers for dry skin and eyes, Motheral said. But more serious damage will need to be evaluated and given further management.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001t3b5vm2bz4bui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Recovery for patients with acute toxicity can be rapid when the vitamin is discontinued,” she said. “Chronic toxicity can affect bones, brain and of course the liver. … Sadly, some of the more serious problems with vitamin A toxicity are not always reversible.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001u3b5vgo7p8dng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade association for dietary supplement and functional food manufacturers, issued a &lt;a href="https://www.crnusa.org/newsroom/crn-cautions-against-misuse-vitamin-measles-prevention" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday warning parents against using high doses of vitamin A to try to keep their children from getting measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001v3b5v1yosfhag@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While vitamin A plays an important role in supporting overall immune function, research hasn’t established its effectiveness in preventing measles infection. CRN is concerned about reports of high-dose vitamin A being used inappropriately, especially in children,” the statement says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001w3b5vn27spbwp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Johnson said she has seen people who were taking vitamin A for measles treatment as well as for prevention. She doesn’t know exactly where these patients heard that they should be taking a lot of vitamin A, she said, but the approach is heavily discussed on social media.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001x3b5ven8sq0dd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s coming out of the health and wellness … influencer industry that downplays the importance of vaccines and tries to promote various spectacular cures like ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine or vitamin A,” Hotez said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001y3b5v8ayrjn9d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ivermectin, a deworming medication, and hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, were both incorrectly touted as treatments for the Covid-19 pandemic but resulted in many &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/26/health/ivermectin-covid-19-warning-injuries/index.html"&gt;poison control reports&lt;/a&gt; and an estimated $&lt;a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2024.00452?utm_campaign=march+2025+issue&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--1UtwuwdFSFcDhgrRowAjYInCOkvC-i1aM4HIyHQqK2P6fRHtXwrzzgWqPwFKWCQc7WDkHUi6lYzxahogkIm0B-x8KvA&amp;amp;_hsmi=348087923&amp;amp;utm_content=ahead+of+print&amp;amp;utm_source=hat&amp;amp;journalCode=hlthaff" target="_blank"&gt;200 million in unnecessary spending&lt;/a&gt;. Experts worry that the drug misinformation so rampant during Covid could mirror rhetoric about vitamin A for measles prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001z3b5vynwq3cf1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In his Fox News interview, Kennedy endorsed an unconventional treatment regimen for measles including a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, which is rich in vitamin A. He praised two West Texas doctors who he said were using this remedy on their patients and had seen “almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry00203b5vsts0cvsa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The antibiotic, clarithromycin, could be an attempt to prevent secondary bacterial infections like pneumonia, but&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7055587/" target="_blank"&gt; evidence&lt;/a&gt; for that is limited. Budesonide is a steroid with a variety of uses, but it’s not clear whether or how it might help someone with measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry00213b5v5c05s29t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The measles outbreak has now affected at least 379 people across Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Kansas has reported 23 measles cases, and officials said Wednesday that they may also be linked to the outbreak.

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever felt like anxiety is taking over your brain, you might have been on to something. Neuroscience now confirms that chronic anxiety doesn’t just alter your mood—it reshapes the structure and function of your brain. But new research is offering hope: these anxiety brain changes aren’t set in stone. In fact, they can be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://techfixated.com/neuroscience-says-anxiety-alters-the-brains-wiring-but-its-reversible/"&gt;Research and reports&lt;/a&gt; reveal that just eight weeks of targeted treatment can restore balance in critical areas affected by anxiety. Participants in one study showed a 15% reduction in amygdala hyperactivity and major improvements in prefrontal cortex function—two brain regions central to emotional regulation.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what exactly happens in the brain when anxiety takes hold? Well, it starts with the amygdala, your brain’s built-in alarm system. When you’re under stress, the amygdala becomes hyperactive, constantly scanning for danger. Over time, this reactivity becomes more automatic and exaggerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the prefrontal cortex—responsible for logic, decision-making, and calming the amygdala—grows weaker. That’s the crux of anxiety brain changes: a stronger fear response and weaker emotional control. But this imbalance caused by anxiety brain changes isn’t irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech. Entertainment. Science.

The concept of neuroplasticity, which is the brain’s ability to rewire itself, means that even deeply ingrained anxiety patterns can be changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), for example, has been shown to restore healthy communication between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, an area that anxiety brain changes heavily target. By challenging anxious thoughts and avoiding avoidance behaviors, CBT strengthens the brain’s “brake system” over fear responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness meditation is another powerful tool. Studies show it increases gray matter density in the prefrontal cortex and reduces the size and reactivity of the amygdala. Even just eight weeks of regular mindfulness practice can produce measurable changes, researchers claim. Then there’s exposure therapy. This is the act of gradually confronting feared situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="is-wp-image-block wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all" alt="brain MRI" class="is-wp-image-block wp-image-6000995" srcset="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?quality=82 2400w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;amp;quality=82 150w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;amp;quality=82 300w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;amp;quality=82 768w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;amp;quality=82 1024w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;amp;quality=82 1536w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;amp;quality=82 2048w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AdobeStock_220350807.jpg?resize=63%2C42&amp;amp;quality=82 63w" sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px"&gt;&lt;span class="image-meta block clearfix"&gt;&lt;span class="source right"&gt;Image source: merydolla / Adobe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This method targets the fear circuitry directly. Repeated exposures to your fears can build a stronger, healthier response over time, reshaping the brain’s pathways back to where they were before the anxiety brain changes took hold. And, of course, consistent exercise rounds out the list.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical activity boosts brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that supports neuron growth and connectivity. This creates the perfect environment for rewiring anxiety brain changes. Understanding&lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/new-study-reveals-how-fear-gets-stuck-in-your-brain/"&gt; how fear gets “stuck” in our brains&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/researchers-discovered-how-the-brain-overcomes-instinctive-fear/"&gt;how we overcome instinctive fears&lt;/a&gt; can both help us better understand anxiety and the changes it makes to our brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s especially exciting is the shift toward personalized treatment. Scientists are learning to identify unique brain activity patterns in people with anxiety, opening the door to more targeted therapies. Someone with strong amygdala reactivity might respond best to mindfulness, while someone with prefrontal cortex underactivation might benefit more from neurostimulation or CBT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the millions living with anxiety, this research marks a turning point. The brain is not broken—it’s simply been rewired by experience. And with the right tools, it can be rewired again. The future of anxiety treatment isn’t just about coping, it’s about change.&lt;/p&gt;

While most gym-goers focus on consuming enough protein and calories to support hypertrophy, certain foods can sabotage muscle growth without them even realising it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These foods may lead to increased inflammation, hormonal imbalances and poor nutrient absorption, all of which can impair recovery and performance. Here are nine foods that secretly kill your muscle gains, backed by science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;span id="isc_attachment_194493" class="isc-source "&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://image.boxrox.com/2023/11/Beer-bar-1024x580.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-194493 with-source" srcset="https://image.boxrox.com/2023/11/Beer-bar-600x340.jpg 600w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/11/Beer-bar-300x170.jpg 300w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/11/Beer-bar-768x435.jpg 768w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/11/Beer-bar-741x420.jpg 741w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/11/Beer-bar-150x85.jpg 150w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/11/Beer-bar-696x394.jpg 696w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/11/Beer-bar-822x466.jpg 822w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;span class="isc-source-text"&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-handing-a-person-a-glass-of-beer-1267323/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;ELEVATE on Pexels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption can have a detrimental impact on muscle recovery, hormone production and protein synthesis. A study by Parr et al. (2014) found that post-exercise alcohol consumption reduced muscle protein synthesis by up to 37%, even when combined with protein intake. Alcohol also disrupts sleep, which is crucial for muscle recovery, and increases cortisol levels, a catabolic hormone that breaks down muscle tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Highly Processed Foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed foods such as fast food, ready meals and packaged snacks are often high in trans fats, refined sugars and artificial additives. Research indicates that trans fats can induce systemic inflammation and negatively affect insulin sensitivity (Mozaffarian et al., 2006), impairing nutrient uptake. High sugar intake also leads to insulin resistance over time, reducing the ability of muscles to absorb glucose efficiently for energy and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="brx-c2d845ee9c3135e94f66a210bdc8bca8 brx-content" id="brx-c2d845ee9c3135e94f66a210bdc8bca8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Sugary Soft Drinks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugary drinks provide empty calories and lead to insulin spikes, promoting fat gain rather than muscle growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://image.boxrox.com/2024/08/Soda-can-1024x580.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-212450" srcset="https://image.boxrox.com/2024/08/Soda-can-600x340.jpg 600w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/08/Soda-can-300x170.jpg 300w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/08/Soda-can-768x435.jpg 768w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/08/Soda-can-741x420.jpg 741w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/08/Soda-can-150x85.jpg 150w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/08/Soda-can-696x394.jpg 696w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/08/Soda-can-822x466.jpg 822w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study by Malik et al. (2010) showed that regular consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was linked to increased visceral fat accumulation. Elevated insulin and glucose levels can also interfere with muscle protein synthesis by promoting a catabolic state when not balanced with adequate nutrient intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. Vegetable Oils High in Omega-6 Fatty Acids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-6 fatty acids, found in processed vegetable oils such as soybean, corn and sunflower oil, promote inflammation when consumed in excess. Chronic inflammation can impair muscle recovery and increase the risk of injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simopoulos (2002) highlights that a high omega-6 to omega-3 ratio contributes to inflammatory conditions and metabolic diseases, both of which negatively affect muscle gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;5. Low-Quality Protein Sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all protein sources are created equal. Highly processed meats such as hot dogs, sausages and certain protein powders contain low-quality protein with poor amino acid profiles. A study by Phillips (2016) found that whole food protein sources, such as lean meats, eggs and dairy, provide superior leucine content, which is essential for stimulating muscle protein synthesis compared to processed alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="brx-ca1f2dbb595313d18e413fc7adbb392f brx-content" id="brx-ca1f2dbb595313d18e413fc7adbb392f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;6. Excessive Fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While fibre is essential for gut health, excessive fibre intake can interfere with nutrient absorption, particularly for minerals like iron, zinc and calcium. Research by Weaver et al. (1999) indicates that high-fibre diets can reduce protein digestion efficiency, potentially impacting muscle growth. Athletes consuming high amounts of whole grains and legumes should monitor fibre intake to avoid digestive discomfort and suboptimal nutrient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;7. Artificial Sweeteners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose and saccharin are commonly found in diet sodas, protein bars and sugar-free snacks. While they are marketed as calorie-free, studies suggest that they may negatively impact gut microbiota, which plays a crucial role in metabolism and nutrient absorption. Suez et al. (2014) found that artificial sweeteners can induce glucose intolerance by altering gut bacteria, potentially impairing muscle recovery and energy regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;8. Low-Fat Dairy Products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-fat dairy products, often recommended for weight loss, may not be ideal for muscle growth. Removing fat from dairy reduces the bioavailability of fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin D, which plays a crucial role in muscle function and testosterone production (Pilz et al., 2011). Full-fat dairy provides essential fatty acids that help optimise anabolic hormone levels and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="brx-fbfa889ead61a80ce831f5eb9e662447 brx-content" id="brx-fbfa889ead61a80ce831f5eb9e662447"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;9. Excessive Caffeine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While caffeine is well-known for its performance-enhancing effects, excessive intake can increase cortisol levels and disrupt sleep patterns. Poor &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boxrox.com/8-sleeping-habits-killing-your-gains-p82814031/" data-type="post" data-id="208715"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is linked to reduced testosterone production and impaired muscle recovery (Leproult &amp;amp; Van Cauter, 2011). Limiting caffeine intake in the evening and consuming it in moderation can help prevent these negative effects while still benefiting from its performance-enhancing properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimising nutrition is just as important as training when it comes to building muscle. Avoiding these nine foods can help support muscle protein synthesis, recovery and overall performance. By prioritising whole, nutrient-dense foods and balancing macronutrients properly, gym-goers can maximise their muscle-building potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Food&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Reason It Kills Gains&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Alcohol&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Reduces protein synthesis and disrupts sleep&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Highly Processed Foods&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Increase inflammation and impair insulin sensitivity&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sugary Soft Drinks&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Promote fat gain and insulin resistance&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Vegetable Oils High in Omega-6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Increase inflammation and impair recovery&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Low-Quality Protein Sources&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Lack essential amino acids for muscle synthesis&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Excessive Fibre&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Reduces protein digestion and mineral absorption&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Artificial Sweeteners&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Disrupt gut microbiota and glucose metabolism&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Low-Fat Dairy Products&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Reduce anabolic hormone production and vitamin absorption&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Excessive Caffeine&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Raises cortisol and disrupts sleep&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Bibliography&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leproult, R. &amp;amp; Van Cauter, E., 2011.

While most gym-goers focus on consuming enough protein and calories to support hypertrophy, certain foods can sabotage muscle growth without them even realising it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These foods may lead to increased inflammation, hormonal imbalances and poor nutrient absorption, all of which can impair recovery and performance. Here are nine foods that secretly kill your muscle gains, backed by science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;span id="isc_attachment_194493" class="isc-source "&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://image.boxrox.com/2023/11/Beer-bar-1024x580.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-194493 with-source" srcset="https://image.boxrox.com/2023/11/Beer-bar-600x340.jpg 600w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/11/Beer-bar-300x170.jpg 300w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/11/Beer-bar-768x435.jpg 768w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/11/Beer-bar-741x420.jpg 741w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/11/Beer-bar-150x85.jpg 150w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/11/Beer-bar-696x394.jpg 696w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/11/Beer-bar-822x466.jpg 822w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;span class="isc-source-text"&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-handing-a-person-a-glass-of-beer-1267323/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;ELEVATE on Pexels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption can have a detrimental impact on muscle recovery, hormone production and protein synthesis. A study by Parr et al. (2014) found that post-exercise alcohol consumption reduced muscle protein synthesis by up to 37%, even when combined with protein intake. Alcohol also disrupts sleep, which is crucial for muscle recovery, and increases cortisol levels, a catabolic hormone that breaks down muscle tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Highly Processed Foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed foods such as fast food, ready meals and packaged snacks are often high in trans fats, refined sugars and artificial additives. Research indicates that trans fats can induce systemic inflammation and negatively affect insulin sensitivity (Mozaffarian et al., 2006), impairing nutrient uptake. High sugar intake also leads to insulin resistance over time, reducing the ability of muscles to absorb glucose efficiently for energy and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="brx-c2d845ee9c3135e94f66a210bdc8bca8 brx-content" id="brx-c2d845ee9c3135e94f66a210bdc8bca8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Sugary Soft Drinks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugary drinks provide empty calories and lead to insulin spikes, promoting fat gain rather than muscle growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://image.boxrox.com/2024/08/Soda-can-1024x580.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-212450" srcset="https://image.boxrox.com/2024/08/Soda-can-600x340.jpg 600w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/08/Soda-can-300x170.jpg 300w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/08/Soda-can-768x435.jpg 768w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/08/Soda-can-741x420.jpg 741w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/08/Soda-can-150x85.jpg 150w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/08/Soda-can-696x394.jpg 696w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/08/Soda-can-822x466.jpg 822w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study by Malik et al. (2010) showed that regular consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was linked to increased visceral fat accumulation. Elevated insulin and glucose levels can also interfere with muscle protein synthesis by promoting a catabolic state when not balanced with adequate nutrient intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. Vegetable Oils High in Omega-6 Fatty Acids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-6 fatty acids, found in processed vegetable oils such as soybean, corn and sunflower oil, promote inflammation when consumed in excess. Chronic inflammation can impair muscle recovery and increase the risk of injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simopoulos (2002) highlights that a high omega-6 to omega-3 ratio contributes to inflammatory conditions and metabolic diseases, both of which negatively affect muscle gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;5. Low-Quality Protein Sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all protein sources are created equal. Highly processed meats such as hot dogs, sausages and certain protein powders contain low-quality protein with poor amino acid profiles. A study by Phillips (2016) found that whole food protein sources, such as lean meats, eggs and dairy, provide superior leucine content, which is essential for stimulating muscle protein synthesis compared to processed alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="brx-ca1f2dbb595313d18e413fc7adbb392f brx-content" id="brx-ca1f2dbb595313d18e413fc7adbb392f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;6. Excessive Fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While fibre is essential for gut health, excessive fibre intake can interfere with nutrient absorption, particularly for minerals like iron, zinc and calcium. Research by Weaver et al. (1999) indicates that high-fibre diets can reduce protein digestion efficiency, potentially impacting muscle growth. Athletes consuming high amounts of whole grains and legumes should monitor fibre intake to avoid digestive discomfort and suboptimal nutrient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;7. Artificial Sweeteners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose and saccharin are commonly found in diet sodas, protein bars and sugar-free snacks. While they are marketed as calorie-free, studies suggest that they may negatively impact gut microbiota, which plays a crucial role in metabolism and nutrient absorption. Suez et al. (2014) found that artificial sweeteners can induce glucose intolerance by altering gut bacteria, potentially impairing muscle recovery and energy regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;8. Low-Fat Dairy Products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-fat dairy products, often recommended for weight loss, may not be ideal for muscle growth. Removing fat from dairy reduces the bioavailability of fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin D, which plays a crucial role in muscle function and testosterone production (Pilz et al., 2011). Full-fat dairy provides essential fatty acids that help optimise anabolic hormone levels and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="brx-fbfa889ead61a80ce831f5eb9e662447 brx-content" id="brx-fbfa889ead61a80ce831f5eb9e662447"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;9. Excessive Caffeine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While caffeine is well-known for its performance-enhancing effects, excessive intake can increase cortisol levels and disrupt sleep patterns. Poor &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boxrox.com/8-sleeping-habits-killing-your-gains-p82814031/" data-type="post" data-id="208715"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is linked to reduced testosterone production and impaired muscle recovery (Leproult &amp;amp; Van Cauter, 2011). Limiting caffeine intake in the evening and consuming it in moderation can help prevent these negative effects while still benefiting from its performance-enhancing properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimising nutrition is just as important as training when it comes to building muscle. Avoiding these nine foods can help support muscle protein synthesis, recovery and overall performance. By prioritising whole, nutrient-dense foods and balancing macronutrients properly, gym-goers can maximise their muscle-building potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Food&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Reason It Kills Gains&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Alcohol&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Reduces protein synthesis and disrupts sleep&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Highly Processed Foods&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Increase inflammation and impair insulin sensitivity&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sugary Soft Drinks&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Promote fat gain and insulin resistance&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Vegetable Oils High in Omega-6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Increase inflammation and impair recovery&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Low-Quality Protein Sources&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Lack essential amino acids for muscle synthesis&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Excessive Fibre&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Reduces protein digestion and mineral absorption&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Artificial Sweeteners&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Disrupt gut microbiota and glucose metabolism&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Low-Fat Dairy Products&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Reduce anabolic hormone production and vitamin absorption&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Excessive Caffeine&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Raises cortisol and disrupts sleep&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Bibliography&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leproult, R. &amp;amp; Van Cauter, E., 2011.

Health officials have worried that the Texas outbreak may be seeding others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;More than 40 measles cases have been reported in New Mexico, and seven have been identified in Oklahoma. In both states, health officials said the infections were connected to the Texas outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In Kansas, the virus has mainly &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2314/Measles-Data" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;infected unvaccinated children&lt;/a&gt; in the southwest corner of the state.

In Ohio, nine of the 10 cases were traced to an unvaccinated man who recently traveled abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Given the measles activity in Texas, New Mexico and other states around the country, we’re disappointed but not surprised we now have several cases here in Ohio,” said Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff, director of the state’s Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Experts fear that declining vaccination rates nationwide have left the country vulnerable to a resurgence of preventable illnesses, including measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Just under 93 percent&lt;/a&gt; of children in kindergarten had the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella in the 2023-24 school year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Experts recommend that at least 95 percent of people in a community be vaccinated in order to avoid outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In Kansas, about &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2016/Kindergarten-Immunization-Data" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;90 percent of kindergartners&lt;/a&gt; were given the M.M.R. shot in the 2023-24 school year, according to state data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;About &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;89 percent&lt;/a&gt; of kindergartners in Ohio had the M.M.R. shot that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Measles, which spreads when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes, is one of the most contagious known viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Within a few weeks of exposure, those who are infected may develop a high fever, a cough, a runny nose and red, watery eyes. Within a few days, a telltale rash breaks out, first as flat, red spots on the face and then spreading down the neck and the torso to the rest of the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In most cases, these symptoms resolve in a few weeks. But in rare cases, the virus causes pneumonia, making it difficult for patients, especially children, to draw oxygen into their lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The infection can also lead to brain swelling, which can cause lasting damage, including blindness, deafness and intellectual disabilities. For every 1,000 children who contract measles, one or two will die, according to the C.D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;One child has died in the Texas outbreak, the first such death in the United States in a decade.

&lt;p&gt;Spring is here and with warmer days ahead, it’s time to prepare your outdoor spaces for summer enjoyment. While barbecues and garden relaxation await, so do those pesky mosquitoes that can ruin even the most perfect evening outdoors. If you want to enjoy a bite-free summer, there’s a natural solution you should &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/plant/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with plant"&gt;plant&lt;/a&gt; before March ends – lemon balm (Melissa officinalis).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The natural mosquito repellent you need to plant now&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As temperatures rise and days get longer, mosquitoes begin preparing for their summer invasion. Acting now gives you a significant advantage in the battle against these irritating insects. &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2025/03/17/for-a-mosquito-free-summer-you-need-to-plant-this-right-now/"&gt;For a mosquito-free summer, you need to plant lemon balm right now&lt;/a&gt; before March ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="farmi-in-text-1" id="farmi-2181569431"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="4875636047" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lemon balm, often confused with citronella, emits a powerful lemony scent that mosquitoes simply cannot tolerate. This natural repellent creates an invisible barrier around your outdoor living spaces. Unlike commercial sprays containing chemical insecticides, lemon balm offers protection without harmful substances.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Strategic placement is key to maximizing effectiveness. Plant lemon balm near seating areas, entryways, or windows where you spend most of your outdoor time. You’ll create mosquito-free zones throughout your garden or balcony, allowing for peaceful summer evenings without constant swatting and scratching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="farmi-display-adsense-3" id="farmi-2084625085"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="4875636047" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="farmi-display-adsense" id="farmi-3361937691"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="4875636047" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The plant’s effectiveness lies in its essential oils, which intensify during warmer months. For immediate protection, simply crush a few leaves between your fingers and rub them on exposed skin areas – nature’s own repellent in seconds!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why choose plants over commercial repellents&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Natural solutions offer numerous advantages over store-bought alternatives. Chemical sprays and repellents often contain DEET and other harsh compounds that may irritate skin or cause respiratory issues with prolonged use. They also generate substantial plastic waste and require frequent repurchasing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plants like lemon balm provide continuous protection throughout the season while enhancing your garden’s aesthetic appeal. Unlike citronella candles that work only when lit and release potentially irritating smoke, lemon balm works silently day and night.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Environmental benefits extend beyond your personal &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/space/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with space"&gt;space&lt;/a&gt;. While managing mosquitoes, you’re also supporting local ecosystems. Lemon balm attracts beneficial pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to garden health. This approach aligns perfectly with other eco-friendly gardening practices, such as using &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2024/09/10/this-dense-plant-cover-turns-out-to-be-the-ideal-solution-against-the-proliferation-of-weeds/"&gt;dense plant covers to prevent weed proliferation&lt;/a&gt; in your garden beds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Creating balance in your outdoor space matters for overall garden health. Just as you might need to &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2024/09/11/4-tips-to-follow-exactly-to-eliminate-the-asian-ladybug-without-compromising-the-ecological-balance-of-your-garden/"&gt;eliminate invasive species like Asian ladybugs without disrupting ecological balance&lt;/a&gt;, using lemon balm offers targeted mosquito protection without harming beneficial insects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Growing and caring for lemon balm&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Planting lemon balm before April ensures it establishes strong roots and leafy growth before mosquito season peaks. This &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/perennial/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with perennial"&gt;perennial&lt;/a&gt; herb thrives in partial shade, making it perfect for various garden locations where other plants might struggle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soil preparation significantly impacts growth success. Choose well-draining, organic-rich soil for optimal results. Moderate, consistent watering keeps plants healthy – about once weekly depending on rainfall. Overwatering can lead to root rot, while underwatering reduces essential oil production and diminishes the plant’s repellent properties.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between June and September, you’ll enjoy delicate white to pale pink flowers that appear in small clusters. These blossoms not only add visual interest but also attract beneficial insects that help &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2024/11/22/when-should-you-feed-the-birds-what-you-need-to-know-to-help-them-effectively-this-winter-and-mistakes-to-avoid/"&gt;maintain garden health, much like feeding birds properly supports your garden ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regular pruning prevents lemon balm from becoming invasive while promoting bushier growth with more leaves. After flowering, trim plants back by one-third to stimulate fresh growth. This maintenance routine also helps protect nearby &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2024/09/18/protect-your-flower-bulbs-from-rodents-this-winter-with-these-3-simple-tips/"&gt;flower bulbs from potential crowding&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring balanced garden development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Additional benefits beyond mosquito control&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lemon balm’s usefulness extends far beyond mosquito repellent properties. This versatile herb offers remarkable health benefits when used in teas or infusions. Its calming properties help reduce stress and anxiety while aiding digestion after heavy summer meals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/kitchen/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with kitchen"&gt;kitchen&lt;/a&gt;, fresh lemon balm leaves add bright citrus notes to summer drinks, fruit salads, and fish dishes. Harvesting is simple – snip stems in the morning when essential oil concentration peaks, leaving at least one-third of the plant intact for continued growth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Garden vigilance remains important even with natural solutions in place. Just as you should &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2024/12/09/beware-flee-immediately-if-you-spot-these-dangerous-black-bags-hanging-trees/"&gt;beware of dangerous black bags hanging from trees&lt;/a&gt; that might indicate pest problems, monitor your lemon balm for any signs of distress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With proper care, one lemon balm plant can provide years of mosquito protection, culinary ingredients, and medicinal benefits. This multifunctional herb truly earns its place in any garden seeking natural pest management solutions while enhancing outdoor living spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;The wolves have firmly taken charge of the henhouse. The federal government has reportedly chosen David Geier, a notorious vaccine skeptic, to lead its upcoming study examining an already debunked link between vaccination and autism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Washington Post &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/25/vaccine-skeptic-hhs-rfk-immunization-autism/"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; on the development Tuesday afternoon, citing anonymous current and former federal health officials. Geier has long advocated against vaccination, often releasing shoddy and swiftly discredited research. His hiring is yet another sign that the country’s public health agenda, now led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is being led astray.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;News of the federal government’s planned study into vaccines and autism &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/cdc-to-re-investigate-vaccines-and-autism-despite-decades-of-evidence-showing-no-link-2000573773"&gt;first broke&lt;/a&gt; in early March. At the time, the CDC was expected to lead the research and began to do so at the behest of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, according to The Washington Post.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, however, HHS reportedly changed tack and instructed the National Institutes of Health to conduct the study instead. HHS has hired Geier to lead the analysis, according to the Washington Post. A listing matching his name can &lt;a href="https://directory.psc.gov/hhsdir/eeKey.asp?Key=69735&amp;amp;Format=Table"&gt;be seen&lt;/a&gt; on the agency’s employee directory, where he is described as a senior data analyst. When briefly interviewed by The Washington Post, Geier declined to confirm whether he had a role in the study, directing questions to those in charge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gizmodo reached out to HHS but has not yet received any comment regarding these latest developments.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Much like HHS chief RFK Jr., Geier has a long history of supporting the anti-vaccination movement, usually alongside his father, Mark Geier. The Geiers have regularly released research purporting to show the hidden dangers of vaccination, often focusing on a link between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0946672X16304400"&gt;mercury-based ingredients in vaccines and autism&lt;/a&gt;—research that Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-robert-f-kennedy-jr-distorted-vaccine-science1/"&gt;himself has cited&lt;/a&gt; in his attacks against vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to his research, Mark Geier has frequently served as an expert legal witness for plaintiffs seeking compensation for alleged “vaccine injuries” in federal court cases, but he has been &lt;a href="https://quackwatch.org/cases/civil/rhogam/memo/"&gt;barred&lt;/a&gt; from doing so in some cases. The Geiers have also &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-may-24-na-autism24-story.html"&gt;created and profited from the sale of autism treatments&lt;/a&gt; supposedly meant to help people damaged by mercury.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Importantly, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2908388/#:~:text=Twenty%20epidemiologic%20studies%20have%20shown,of%20epidemiologic%20and%20statistical%20methods."&gt;vast majority of studies&lt;/a&gt; examining the issue have failed to find any connection between autism and vaccines or their ingredients. The Geiers’ research has also been &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030604060812/http://aap.org/profed/thimaut-may03.htm"&gt;routinely&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.respectfulinsolence.com/2006/03/06/the-geiers-go-dumpsterdiving-y-1/"&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; by scientists over the years for misinterpreting data to support their agenda, and their studies have occasionally been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5705728/"&gt;retracted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mark Geier does have scientific training as a physician and geneticist, but David Geier only has a bachelor’s degree in biology. In 2011, the Maryland State Board of Physicians &lt;a href="https://quackwatch.org/cases/board/med/geier/order/#:~:text=The%20Maryland%20State%20Board%20of%20Physicians%20has,below)%20states%20that%20he%20misrepresented%20his%20credentials."&gt;suspended&lt;/a&gt; and later revoked Mark Geier’s license to practice medicine in the state over allegations that he mistreated several autistic patients in his care; that same year, the state &lt;a href="https://www.mbp.state.md.us/BPQAPP/orders/GeierOrder07.302.pdf"&gt;charged&lt;/a&gt; David Geier with practicing medicine without a license, alleging that he misrepresented himself as a doctor to his father’s patients (Geier claimed that his only role in the practice was administrative).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In securing his nomination to lead HHS, RFK Jr. assured his critics that he would have no issue acknowledging that vaccines don’t cause autism once presented with the scientific evidence showing as much. But Kennedy has a long track record of ignoring this evidence, even &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-jr-vaccine-trump-science-autism-9b99621b01f11b7f0bdc81e5a0b82d2b"&gt;dismissing examples of it&lt;/a&gt; during a Senate hearing prior to his confirmation. Geier’s hiring is another strong indicator that any such discovery process will be rigged in favor of the anti-vaccination movement.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Nine of these cases are linked to the adult male who was reported as the &lt;a href="https://www.whio.com/news/local/first-measles-case-detected-ohio-2025/AGGWCVU5JVDJLCGXKHF5OGGWEE/" target="_blank"&gt;first case in Ohio&lt;/a&gt; this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;The spokesperson said none of these individuals have been vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 vUOFc body-paragraph"&gt;“Given the measles activity in Texas, New Mexico, and other states around the country, we’re disappointed but not surprised we now have several cases here in Ohio and known exposure in some counties,” Vanderhoff said. “This disease can be very serious, even deadly, but it is almost entirely avoidable by being properly vaccinated.

&lt;p&gt;The cases in Kansas are likely part of the mushrooming outbreak that began in West Texas in late January. On March 13, Kansas reported a single measles case, the first the state had seen since 2018. The nine cases reported last week had ties to that original case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spreading infections and misinformation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, KDHE Communications Director Jill Bronaugh told Ars Technica over email that the department has found a genetic link between the first Kansas case and the cases in West Texas, which has similarly spread swiftly in under-vaccinated communities and also spilled over to New Mexico and Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While genetic sequencing of the first Kansas case reported is consistent with an epidemiological link to the Texas and New Mexico outbreaks, the source of exposure is still unknown," Bronaugh told Ars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bronaugh added that KDHE, along with local health departments, is continuing to work to track down people who may have been exposed to measles in affected counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;In Texas&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, the latest outbreak count has hit 327 across 15 counties, mostly children and almost entirely unvaccinated. Forty cases have been hospitalized, and one death has been reported—a 6-year-old unvaccinated girl who had no underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, The New York Times reported that as measles continues to spread, parents have continued to eschew vaccines and instead &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/health/measles-kennedy-vitamin-a.html"&gt;embraced "alternative" treatments, including vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;, which has been touted by anti-vaccine advocate and current US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Vitamin A accumulates in the body and can be toxic with large doses or extended use. Texas doctors told the Times that they've now treated a handful of unvaccinated children who had been given so much vitamin A that they had signs of liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I had a patient that was only sick a couple of days, four or five days, but had been taking it for like three weeks," one doctor told the Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;In New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, cases are up to 43, with two hospitalizations and one death in an unvaccinated adult who did not seek medical care. &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/rash-illness/measles.html"&gt;In Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, officials have identified nine cases, with no hospitalizations or deaths so far.&lt;/p&gt;

I learned in botany class that the exchange of gases occurs in the leaves of trees, not the bark,” you are correct. Leaves have tiny holes in their surfaces—called stomata, or “little mouths”—that open and close to let tree leaves draw in &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/carbon-sources-and-sinks/" target="_blank"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; and release oxygen for &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/photosynthesis/" target="_blank"&gt;photosynthesis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;(&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/the-earth-has-lungs-watch-them-breathe" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i class=" "&gt;The Earth has lungs. Watch them breathe.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But trees also respire, just as we do, pulling in oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. And &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/the-earth-has-lungs-watch-them-breathe" target="_blank"&gt;respiration&lt;/a&gt; occurs in the cells of all living tree tissues, not just the leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;So how can this exchange take place in the parts of trees that aren’t leaves, like trunks and branches, tissues that don’t have stomata? It’s a puzzle, because tree bark is the first line of protection for a tree. It acts as an impermeable layer that prevents insects and diseases from getting to a tree’s interior structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>National Geographic</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 20:27:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQcnNfYWZhNzdLbUFTbFZpemFvb1V5OHluNWhaNS1pYmdySjk0a2IzdDIzQWRMb1VWeVNjVXA2VGU4N2cwWnJ2bG0wN3NqSERSU3ZZa2FBX3MwT0FTN1hmWk1YT1hWQnVPZVc0U1J6M0ZneWhhdVEzQk5tbDJZdWNqdXM3cU1BUQ</guid></item><item><title>Ohio Department of Health confirms outbreak of measles in Ashtabula County: Here's what you need to know - WKYC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi-AFBVV95cUxPTGd3WTJ4ZTFSMFk3aXozaWRlUGtqa3NVQ1BiNGVCTWJ4My1OVGZXYnc0Q1NZeEFlX0VQOHAyTDB3S19zVHBLNElfczJxWTlHcnN6U2o4RjQ5UU9wRm1zVzJFYjYtUU5oTGNObnRDV0JmNDNQQXZMZW8yaEloT3pOVkF0VXU4TzR6NU9MSjNaN0dfazJoV1Zfd2lQdFpnRUhoeDgwN3Jsd3lxX3pKRXc1dk1EYkJwOHdQaXNva2dnM2pFQTJJV0FEQ1hyYmZxdzY0VEYyS0lzMllWV0lnSjN6dnhVZm1wbzc4TDk5TmpNYzN3R1F3eUpTNw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;ODH officials have confirmed 10 measles cases in Ashtabula County, nine are linked to the man who was reported as the state's first case of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLUMBUS, Ohio — The Ohio Department of Health has announced a measles outbreak in &lt;a href="/local"&gt;Ashtabula County&lt;/a&gt; in addition to a confirmed case in Knox County.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to ODH Director Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff, a total of 10 measles cases have been identified. "Nine are linked to an adult man reported last week as &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-ohio-department-of-health-confirms-ashtabula-county-case-infected-adult/95-4df76687-091c-4a08-a551-5de5fd3fc91f"&gt;the state's first measles case of 2025,"&lt;/a&gt; the ODH said in a release. "None of the individuals were vaccinated."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given the measles activity in Texas, New Mexico, and other states around the country, we’re disappointed but not surprised we now have several cases here in Ohio and known exposure in some counties,” said Vanderhoff in a statement. “This disease can be very serious, even deadly, but it is almost entirely avoidable by being properly vaccinated. Measles is especially dangerous for young children, so I strongly urge all parents across Ohio to make sure your children are vaccinated. It is a crucial layer of protection that can save lives.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials say the confirmed case in Knox County is from a visitor "who exposed others to measles in Knox and nearby counties."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measles "outbreak" is defined by the CDC as three or more related cases. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Measles can spread quickly, and each case can lead to an additional 12 to 18 cases if people aren’t protected against the disease. The CDC reported 378 cases nationwide as of March 20," the ODH noted in its release.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials add that measles is "extremely contagious and can spread to others through coughing and sneezing. It can be brought into Ohio by individuals who travel to places where measles is spreading. If people are not protected against the disease, nine out of 10 people who are exposed will become ill."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohio had 90 cases of measles in 2022, when an outbreak in central Ohio totaled 85 cases. The state had one measles case in 2023 and seven in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials say the confirmed case in Knox County is from a visitor "who exposed others to measles in Knox and nearby counties."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ODH says it is working with health departments in Ashtabula and Knox counties to follow up on potential exposures and to promote opportunities for vaccination.

&lt;p&gt;Medical professionals emphasize that the two-dose regimen of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) — administered between 12-15 months and again between ages 4 and 6 — is 97% effective against measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends all children get two doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the first dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age. The MMR vaccine can also be given to adults born after 1957 who are not vaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASHTABULA COUNTY, Ohio — The Ohio Department of Health announced a measles outbreak in Ashtabula County and a confirmed case in Knox County on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director Bruce Vanderhoff said ODH and Ashtabula County have identified 10 measles cases. Nine of the cases are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/ohio/ohio-first-measles-case-2025-ashtabula-county/530-9f8dfb61-d0f1-48c0-ab90-916ba69e2b5e"&gt;linked to an adult man&lt;/a&gt; reported last week as the state's first measles case of the year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health department said the case in Knox County was from a visitor to the county who exposed others in Knox and nearby counties.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ODH is working with health departments in Ashtabula and Knox counties to follow up on potential exposures and to share opportunities for vaccination.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines a measles outbreak as three or more related cases.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This disease can be very serious, even deadly, but it is almost entirely avoidable by being properly vaccinated. Measles is especially dangerous for young children, so I strongly urge all parents across Ohio to make sure your children are vaccinated. It is a crucial layer of protection that can save lives," Vanderhoff said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical professionals warn we may begin to see more cases of measles in the next three weeks, as this is typically the time it takes for the virus to manifest symptoms after exposure. Symptoms usually start to appear about 13 to 14 days following infection.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you return from vacation and start to feel unwell shortly thereafter, it's possible that you may have been exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;dangerous complications&lt;/a&gt; such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to prevent measles?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC says the best way to protect yourself is with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are about 97% effect at preventing measles. One dose is about 93% effective.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Columbus Public Health Commissioner Mysheika Roberts said everyone 12 months and older should get their first dose of the MMR vaccine and the second dose between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

And the same research team also reported an experiment implanting a pig liver into a brain-dead person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Scientists are &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pig-organ-transplant-xenotransplant-revivicor-ad400e7f1d30c2722456eb92e641449f" target="_blank"&gt;genetically altering pigs&lt;/a&gt; so their organs are more humanlike in hopes of alleviating a transplant shortage. Two initial xenotransplants in the U.S. — &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pig-heart-transplant-xenotransplant-maryland-22a3bb89b960ec3da49e7cf2432c3947" target="_blank"&gt;two pig hearts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pig-kidney-transplant-xenotransplant-nyu-c88fd6e3f72de09ed6e3c929ffdb53bc" target="_blank"&gt;two pig kidneys&lt;/a&gt; — were short-lived. But two additional pig kidney recipients so far are thriving — an &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pig-kidney-transplant-xenotransplant-revivicor-844b33450a9c228d1138827c1de8549d" target="_blank"&gt;Alabama woman&lt;/a&gt; who received a transplant in November and a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pig-kidney-transplant-organ-xenotransplant-mass-general-5c3c620f989092ba70720e54e2e4138f" target="_blank"&gt;New Hampshire man&lt;/a&gt; who received one in January. A U.S. clinical trial is about to begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Nearly three weeks after the kidney surgery the Chinese patient “is very well” and the pig kidney likewise is functioning very well, Dr. Lin Wang, of Xijing Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University in Xi’an, told reporters in a briefing this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Wang, part of the hospital’s xenotransplant team, said the kidney recipient remains in the hospital for testing. Chinese media have reported she is a 69-year-old woman who was diagnosed with kidney failure eight years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But Wang pointed to a potential next step in xenotransplantation — learning to transplant pig livers. His team reported Wednesday in the journal Nature that a pig liver transplanted into a brain-dead person survived for 10 days, with no early signs of rejection. He said the pig liver produced bile and albumin — important for basic organ function — although not as much as human livers do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The liver is a complex challenge because of its varied jobs, including removing waste, breaking down nutrients and medicines, fighting infection, storing iron and regulating blood clotting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We do find that it could function a little bit in a human being,” Wang said. He speculated that would be enough to help support a failing human liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In the U.S. last year, surgeons at the University of Pennsylvania attempted that sort of “bridge” support &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pig-liver-kidneys-transplants-penn-ba9b2d181d26425cc4927ad6c55f79f7" target="_blank"&gt;by externally attaching a pig liver&lt;/a&gt; to a brain-dead human body to filter blood, much like dialysis for failing kidneys. U.S. pig developer eGenesis is studying that approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In China, Wang’s team didn’t remove the deceased person’s own liver, instead implanting the pig liver near it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That “clouds the picture,” said Dr. Parsia Vagefi, a liver transplant surgeon at UT Southwestern Medical Center who wasn’t involved with the work. “It’s hopefully a first step but it’s still, a lot like any good research, more questions than answers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Wang said his team later replaced the human liver of another brain-dead person with a pig liver and is analyzing the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;According to media reports, another Chinese hospital last year transplanted a pig liver into a living patient after a piece of his own cancerous liver was removed but it’s unclear how that experiment turned out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 20:14:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE4zSlVNSTNmRWtEejh0NW1CMHhTZjh4MEpDSTFkZ3JOU1hyajNxczlNZHI2YjdlSThlbVlZc1c2RTFzUF96bjE5VTgtV2N3dzctbEpydjA0d3BPYkM0djQtRFBVcjVzWXNIZVZiSkFMWFhCaTZXd1pReFVGMWFnNkHSAVZBVV95cUxOVmZtajREdVFfMUh1blQ3UVdyOW5wNHN5TkVsdDFRS0VjM0ctZUQ2RGowY0w1MFVxbjNrU2Y1QUtNS1NNeWZtM1VKc2E4dC0zR2tFbkdsZw</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Discover a Simple Trick to Eliminate Microplastics From Tap Water - The Brighter Side of News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxQeDRZTzZLTzJjRF9CN19NMm5LTUdQYjZNeE5Md09wa1JkMFFVNExJdnFnZkZsLXNiU3dEc19Tam5CcS1pSVZfR1V4SEQ5SmZyZDM4YTFJTDFMQ082am9lZ1R2djNId3doSFo2OEw1UG4tc0FpenRBbjhHVEd0SHl6MlFsVzJfdk5kWjRtd09zd3hZOExjMGtQSThPV0pxZ2Nqb05BY25NbWlhSEEwYlFRWWRvV2lOUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root css-a9h2n1" data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks"&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day, tiny plastic particles called nano- and microplastics find their way into your drinking water. Invisible to the naked eye, these fragments could silently threaten your health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research, however, provides hope through a surprisingly simple solution. Scientists have discovered that boiling and filtering tap water significantly reduces these &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/teabags-release-billions-of-microplastic-particles-into-a-single-cup/"&gt;harmful particles&lt;/a&gt;, offering a practical method to keep your drinking water safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="how_plastic_particles_invade_your_drinking_water"&gt;How Plastic Particles Invade Your Drinking Water&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nano- and microplastics are tiny plastic bits that contaminate water sources around the world. Nanoplastics measure less than 1 micrometer, while microplastics range from 1 to 5000 micrometers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tiny plastics mostly originate from household items, packaging materials, and even clothing fibers that wash into rivers and lakes. Unfortunately, standard water treatment systems often struggle to remove these minuscule particles, especially &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/natural-solution-successfully-removes-98-of-nanoplastics-from-water/"&gt;nanoplastics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Graphical abstract of the study.

Researchers analyzed 159 tap water samples from 14 countries. They discovered nano- and microplastics in nearly 81% of these samples, with common plastics like polystyrene, polyethylene, and polypropylene dominating the mix. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you drink this water, plastic particles may accumulate in your body tissues, potentially causing health problems. Researchers have linked these plastics to changes in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-discover-new-link-between-gut-bacteria-and-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, insulin resistance, and liver disorders, though scientists are still investigating their long-term impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_surprising_power_of_boiling_water"&gt;The Surprising Power of Boiling Water&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Asian countries like China, Vietnam, and Indonesia, people traditionally boil tap water before drinking it. Boiling water was initially practiced to eliminate harmful bacteria and chemicals. However, new research reveals an additional benefit: boiling water can trap and remove plastic particles from tap water effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists from &lt;a href="https://en.gzhmu.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Guangzhou Medical University&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://english.jnu.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jinan University&lt;/a&gt; in China recently tested this theory. They took tap water samples containing known amounts of nano- and microplastics, then boiled them for five minutes. After letting the water cool for ten minutes, they filtered it through a standard coffee filter or a stainless-steel tea strainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Boiling hard water, which contains high levels of calcium and magnesium minerals, dramatically reduced the plastic particles. When water is boiled, these minerals create a white crust called calcium carbonate, or limescale, often seen inside kettles and pots. This limescale effectively traps plastic particles, allowing them to be filtered out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers observed an impressive removal rate. For water containing 180 milligrams of calcium carbonate per liter, boiling and filtering removed about 84% of the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-develop-plant-based-biodegradable-microplastics/"&gt;plastic particles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even better, water with higher mineral content (around 300 milligrams per liter) saw a removal rate of up to 90%. Soft water, containing fewer minerals, still benefited—boiling and filtering removed about 25% of the plastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images of reference NP (Reference) and incrustants began to grow on NP surface and finally encapsulated NP at 25–100 °C.

According to the researchers, the secret lies in how heat affects calcium carbonate. When water heats up, calcium carbonate molecules start bonding together, forming solid crystals. These crystals attach to the surface of plastic particles, encapsulating them completely. As the water cools, these crystals sink, dragging the plastic down with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This simple boiling-water strategy can 'decontaminate' NMPs from household tap water and has the potential for harmlessly alleviating human intake of NMPs through &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/fog-harvesting-could-be-the-answer-for-water-starved-cities-around-the-world/"&gt;water consumption&lt;/a&gt;," the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also confirmed that the process works for both nanoplastics (extremely small particles) and larger microplastics. Using fluorescent polystyrene microspheres as test particles, they clearly observed how plastic particles got trapped within calcium carbonate crystals. Additional tests with plastics like polyethylene and polypropylene, aged under sunlight to mimic environmental conditions, showed similar promising results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Influence factors on the formation of nanoplastic (NP) and incrustant coprecipitates at different temperatures.

Most homes already have the tools needed: a pot, kettle, or stove, and a simple strainer. Researchers emphasized using metal or glass containers instead of plastic to boil water, as heated plastic may release harmful chemicals like bisphenol or antimony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While boiling water significantly reduces nano- and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-create-recyclable-alternative-to-durable-plastics/"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt;, its effectiveness can differ depending on local water hardness. Areas with hard water benefit the most, but even soft water sees meaningful improvement. The researchers suggest boiling and filtering your water regularly to ensure consistent reduction in plastic exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Drinking boiled water apparently is a viable long-term strategy for reducing global exposure to NMPs," the research team noted.

However, the medical professional who gave her the shot made a dire mistake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, the woman was injected with a vaccine for tuberculosis, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14019873/infection-tuberculosis-cold-early-stage.html"&gt;the deadliest infection&lt;/a&gt; in the world, with an estimated 1.2 million deaths each year, resulting in a severe tuberculosis (TB) infection that required six months of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The TB vaccine in typically given to babies soon after they are born, making any adverse events more common among that group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Severe complications of the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine for TB, particularly in healthy people, are rare, with about one to 10 percent of recipients recorded in the medical literature having experienced them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These complications range from relatively mild - blisters at the injection site and swelling - to life-threatening lesions in the lungs, liver, or spleen, inflamed bones, and widespread infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patient, from Ireland, developed an abscess with oozing pus at the site on her arm where she was injected. After weeks of doctors’ struggling to identify the cause, believing at first it was caused by inflamed connective tissue in the skin, they tested the pus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Testing revealed the woman had TB-causing bacteria in her body, possibly caused by the strain &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-7802171/Cattle-twice-likely-catch-bovine-TB-cattle-badgers.html"&gt;more common in cattle&lt;/a&gt;, which is used in a weakened form to make the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The BCG vaccine was incorrectly injected into the muscle, though it should have been administered under the skin. Because the BCG contains bacteria, not viruses like the MMR shot, injecting it into the muscle allowed the bacteria to spread unchecked, leading to infection in the deltoid muscle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;TB typically causes a lung infection, but in this case, the otherwise healthy patient developed swelling in her arm as a result of the incorrect vaccine being administered in the wrong way&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Administration of the BCG vaccine intramuscularly is commonly the result of an error and can lead to rare and preventable complications, even in immunocompetent patients,’ doctors who reported the case said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘A reasonable explanation for the error in this case is that the healthcare professional administering the vaccine confused the [the TB vaccine] for the MMR vaccine.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The person who administered the BCG vaccine did so in the way that an MMR vaccine is meant to be administered – via injection at the muscle level because the weakened forms of the viruses replicate slowly there, prompting a stronger immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The TB vaccine, which contains a weakened form of the bacteria Mycobacterium bovis, is meant to be injected just below the skin, which triggers a local immune reponse where the bacteria can stimulate immunity without spreading to other parts of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Viruses used to make vaccines like the MMR replicate inside cells when injected into the muscle, but the bacteria used to make the BCG vaccine is more easily controlled when administrered under the skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When injected into the muscle, the bacteria was allowed to spread more easily&lt;span&gt; into the deltoid muscle, where the immune system could not stop the TB-causing bacteria from spreading unchecked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This led to an abscess in the 30-year-old's arm, which doctors still say is a rare occurrence ‘primarily in the pediatric population.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The adverse effects doctors are likely to see include injection-site abscess, inflammation of the lymph nodes, chronic bone pain and mobility problems, and a body-wide infection causing fever, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, enlarged liver, severe cough, arthritis, particularly in immunocompromised patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The healthy 30-year-old patient was mistakenly given the vaccine for TB, which was injected improperly, resulting in a whole-body infection and a fluid-filled abscess in her deltoid muscle, indicated by the arrow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman was treated with a variety of anti-TB medications, which were effective, ‘and she recovered fully and reported no further symptoms 6 months after initiation of the anti-tuberculosis treatment,’ the doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three months later, her abscess had shrunken considerably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors said her case was highly unusual. Typically, complications – already rare – are seen in babies and young children, generally those who are immunocompromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This patient, though, ‘was a healthy immunocompetent adult, in contrast to the cases in the literature.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their report was published in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/946723"&gt;American Journal of Case Reports&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Injection errors are &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8989021/#:~:text=Short%20abstract,measures%20is%20of%20great%20importance."&gt;the main culprit&lt;/a&gt; and the most common causes of such a severe reaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NIH published the case of an eight-month-old girl who, at birth, received the tuberculosis vaccine in her thigh muscle instead of into her skin as it was meant to be administered.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class="ar__sum mt-3"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Nearly 380 cases of measles have been identified in the US this year, the highest number since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  
  

  
  
  
&lt;/header&gt;

  &lt;div id="articleContent" class="ar__con order-3 col-12 col-lg-7 mt-3 px-md-6"&gt;

    

    

    
    
    &lt;p class="truth-eafdcf23e68d7c8f5e06f7ccca0509db truth-post-content-before" id="truth-eafdcf23e68d7c8f5e06f7ccca0509db"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unproven remedies for treating measles peddled by Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are complicating doctors’ efforts to deal with an outbreak in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “remedies” are being utilized primarily by parents — many of whom have anti-vaccine views — to treat and prevent measles in their children, and include consuming high doses of vitamin A, sometimes in the form of cod liver oil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While vitamin A is sometimes used to help manage measles symptoms for people with lower levels of immunity, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/health/measles-kennedy-vitamin-a.html"&gt;it is not effective in preventing a person from contracting the virus&lt;/a&gt;, whereas two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97 percent effective. Even after contracting measles, it is advised that any use of vitamin A to treat the virus &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/what-you-should-know-about-measles-and-vitamin-a/"&gt;be supervised by health professionals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="truth-29c5d98a7f0dc4e4875b8b59cb61a00f truth-post-content-high" id="truth-29c5d98a7f0dc4e4875b8b59cb61a00f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Excessive consumption of vitamin A can result in serious health complications — indeed, several unvaccinated children in Texas have had to be treated for liver damage due the vitamin-based regimen some families are using, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/health/measles-kennedy-vitamin-a.html"&gt;a children’s hospital in Lubbock, Texas, announced&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The increase in parents using vitamin A as the primary treatment for measles — despite no scientific backing — comes after Kennedy has downplayed the outbreak for weeks and falsely promoted the treatment option as effective.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

  
  

&lt;/article&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In late February, &lt;a href="https://truthout.org/articles/rfk-jr-spreads-dangerous-lies-about-measles-as-texas-outbreak-tops-220-cases/"&gt;Kennedy claimed that measles outbreaks happen “every year,”&lt;/a&gt; ignoring the fact that, two decades ago (and prior to anti-vaccine sentiment gaining prominence in the U.S.), measles was considered effectively eliminated in the country due to vaccination campaigns successfully lowering case numbers. The current outbreak also exceeds numbers from recent years — only three months into the year, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-case-confirmed-dc-amtrak-passenger-train-union-station-health-officials/"&gt;2025 has seen the highest number of measles cases in the U.S. since 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has acknowledged that vaccines are effective at preventing the spread of measles, but also &lt;a href="https://truthout.org/articles/rfk-jr-spreads-dangerous-lies-about-measles-as-texas-outbreak-tops-220-cases/"&gt;peddled the lie that vaccination isn’t as effective&lt;/a&gt; as direct exposure to the virus — advice that is dangerous, especially for children, as &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/resource/frequently-asked-questions-about-measles/"&gt;measles can result in death or lifelong complications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors have identified 327 cases of measles in the Texas outbreak, mostly in unvaccinated children. Cases outside of Texas are also cropping up, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-case-confirmed-dc-amtrak-passenger-train-union-station-health-officials/"&gt;including a confirmed case of a person in Washington, D.C. being diagnosed with the virus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That person reportedly traveled on an Amtrak train through several cities on the East Coast before being treated at an urgent care clinic last week, potentially exposing others to the virus. While in D.C., the individual also “visited multiple locations” while they were contagious, district health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In total, there have been 378 confirmed cases of measles across 17 states in the U.S. since the start of the year. &lt;a href="https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2025-03-21-cdc-measles-cases-rise-378-across-us"&gt;Nine out of 10 of those cases were “outbreak-associated,”&lt;/a&gt; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="truth-post-content-after" id="truth-954806621"&gt;&lt;div class="callout inline-callout p-4 mb-5 callout-- callout--white truth-target" id="truth-326788" data-callout-id="326788" data-callout-theme="white" data-callout-placement="Post Content - After" data-callout-title="2025-03 Main Campaign (FRU) We’re not backing down in the face of Trump’s threats." data-truth-trackid="326788" data-truth-trackbid="1"&gt;&lt;div class="p-2 text-start"&gt;
&lt;h5 class="pb-2"&gt;We’re not backing down in the face of Trump’s threats.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p class="mb-3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As Donald Trump is inaugurated a second time, independent media organizations are faced with urgent mandates: Tell the truth more loudly than ever before. Do that work even as our standard modes of distribution (such as social media platforms) are being manipulated and curtailed by forces of fascist repression and ruthless capitalism. Do that work even as journalism and journalists face targeted attacks, including from the government itself. And do that work in community, never forgetting that we’re not shouting into a faceless void – we’re reaching out to real people amid a life-threatening political climate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="mb-3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our task is formidable, and it requires us to ground ourselves in our principles, remind ourselves of our utility, dig in and commit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="mb-3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a dizzying number of corporate news organizations – either through need or greed – rush to implement new ways to further monetize their content, and others acquiesce to Trump’s wishes, now is a time for movement media-makers to double down on community-first models.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="mb-3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At &lt;em&gt;Truthout&lt;/em&gt;, we are reaffirming our commitments on this front: We won’t run ads or have a paywall because we believe that everyone should have access to information, and that access should exist without barriers and free of distractions from craven corporate interests. We recognize the implications for democracy when information-seekers click a link only to find the article trapped behind a paywall or buried on a page with dozens of invasive ads. The laws of capitalism dictate an unending increase in monetization, and much of the media simply follows those laws. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Truthout&lt;/em&gt; and many of our peers are dedicating ourselves to following other paths – a commitment which feels vital in a moment when corporations are evermore overtly embedded in government.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="mb-3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over 80 percent of&lt;em&gt; Truthout&lt;/em&gt;‘s funding comes from small individual donations from our community of readers, and the remaining 20 percent comes from a handful of social justice-oriented foundations. Over a third of our total budget is supported by recurring monthly donors, many of whom give because they want to help us keep &lt;em&gt;Truthout&lt;/em&gt; barrier-free for everyone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="mb-3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can help by giving today during our fundraiser. &lt;strong&gt;We have until midnight tonight to add 153 new monthly donors. &lt;/strong&gt;Whether you can make a small monthly donation or a larger gift, &lt;em&gt;Truthout&lt;/em&gt; only works with your support.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="m-0"&gt;&lt;a href="#XEGQPXGY"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
