even bullying or perceptions of unfair treatment and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In a presentation of the report's findings, staff were told that "some of the behaviours

said they felt unable to report unethical behaviour without fear of reprisals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A summary of the report's findings stated, "many staff report feeling

class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide is the key component of weight loss and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="159957" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; drugs like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-benefits-and-risks-revealed-in-new-study"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and Wegovy, and an international team of researchers has now discovered it can also do wonders for people who have developed &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-estimates-millions-in-us-risk-liver-damage-from-herbal-remedies"&gt;liver disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/drug-development-process/step-3-clinical-research"&gt;phase 3 clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; involving 800 participants and lasting 72 weeks, a weekly dose of semaglutide was effective in almost two-thirds of patients at treating a serious form of fatty liver disease known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_dysfunction%E2%80%93associated_steatotic_liver_disease"&gt;Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis&lt;/a&gt; (MASH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The results from this landmark study across 37 countries provide strong evidence that semaglutide can help patients with MASH by not only improving liver health, but also addressing the underlying metabolic issues that contribute to the disease," &lt;a href="https://www.vcuhealth.org/news/vcu-led-research-highlights-semaglutides-potential-for-treating-fatty-liver-disease/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Arun Sanyal, a professor of medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_159960" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159960" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/LiverChart.jpg" alt="Liver treatment chart" class="wp-image-159960 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/LiverChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/LiverChart-600x276.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-159960" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The treatment had benefits for reducing inflammation and scarring. (Sanyal et al., &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were split into two groups. Of those given the semaglutide treatment, 62.9 percent saw improvements in their MASH, compared to 34.3 percent of the group given a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="159957" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; treatment instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, liver fibrosis (scarring) – which happens as the liver tries to repair damage – was reduced in 36.8 percent of patients given the semaglutide treatment, compared to 22.4 percent of patients given placebos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improvements in both MASH and fibrosis were seen in 32.7 percent of the participants on semaglutide, compared to 16.1 percent of the placebo group. It's a comprehensive win for the drug, which is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-loss-drug-semaglutide-shows-promise-as-alzheimers-treatment"&gt;showing potential&lt;/a&gt; in many different areas of health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That placebo effect is fairly typical, by the way, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/incredible-placebo-study-shows-fake-pills-can-reduce-stress"&gt;often happens in trials&lt;/a&gt;: it's thought to be a combination of the psychological boost of thinking you're being treated, plus a tendency to live more healthily and carefully if you know you're part of a study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If approved, this could offer an additional therapeutic option for patients with MASH and fibrosis," &lt;a href="https://www.vcuhealth.org/news/vcu-led-research-highlights-semaglutides-potential-for-treating-fatty-liver-disease/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sanyal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is crucial, given the strong link between MASH and cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal conditions, where semaglutide has already shown established health benefits."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide is a GLP-1 (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1"&gt;glucagon-like peptide-1&lt;/a&gt;) receptor agonist, essentially acting like the natural GLP-1 hormone to help regulate key metabolic processes – including reducing appetite and lowering blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes it effective for treating obesity and diabetes, but this boost in biological regulation seems to have plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/not-just-weight-loss-8-conditions-drugs-like-wegovy-might-treat"&gt;other benefits too&lt;/a&gt;. When it comes to liver disease, the thinking is that the metabolism and anti-inflammatory improvements triggered by the drug help to treat some of the key drivers of MASH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="159957" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; is continuing, expanding to a larger group of people for a full five years to see if these initial improvements continue. With only one approved treatment available for MASH, new options are urgently needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By treating both liver disease and its metabolic causes, semaglutide offers a promising new approach for millions of patients," &lt;a href="https://www.vcuhealth.org/news/vcu-led-research-highlights-semaglutides-potential-for-treating-fatty-liver-disease/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sanyal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa2413258"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma64wev2000m27p9fnd66eqz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, is asking the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for an agencywide “scientific process” on treating measles and other conditions with medications as well as alternative therapies such as vitamins, HHS said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pat00083b6mxu23pykm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The HHS statement notes that “the CDC continues to recommend measles vaccination as the most effective way to prevent the disease,” and Kennedy himself &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/08/health/measles-outbreak-urban-areas"&gt;has publicly encouraged&lt;/a&gt; measles vaccination – while saying it’s a “personal” choice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau00093b6mbpzod70s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, “we recognize that some individuals and communities across the U.S. may choose not to vaccinate,” the HHS statement says. “Our commitment is to support all families – regardless of their vaccination status – in reducing the risk of hospitalization, serious complications, and death from measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000a3b6mlww0rdlj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Secretary Kennedy will be enlisting the entire agency to activate a scientific process to treat a host of diseases, including measles, with single or multiple existing drugs in combination with vitamins and other modalities,” the statement says. “This effort will involve collaboration with universities nationwide to develop protocols, conduct testing, and pursue approval for new uses of safe and effective therapeutics that meet the highest scientific standards.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000b3b6muf0xl23q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a measles outbreak centered in West Texas continues to grow, reaching nearly 800 cases as of this week, disease experts fear that Kennedy’s continuing emphasis on &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/kennedy-measles-texas-doctor-treatment/index.html"&gt;unconventional therapies&lt;/a&gt; such as cod liver oil, the antibiotic clarithromycin and the steroid budesonide might take away from efforts to boost vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000c3b6mp7g2nilh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve got doctors now in these communities that are teaching other doctors how to treat this disease with aerosolized steroids, with budesonide, with clarithromycin and others,” Kennedy said Monday at a town hall event hosted by Dr. Phil McGraw.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000d3b6m0eec841a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles after the recommended two doses, but there is no specific treatment for measles once someone is infected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000e3b6mphmmg2jl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In severe cases, doctors may offer treatments such as supplemental oxygen and fluids to help patients get through the worst of their illness. The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;also recommends&lt;/a&gt; two doses of physician-administered vitamin A in cases of severe measles, such as people who are hospitalized. Infectious disease experts note that the vitamin is most useful in impoverished countries where children are significantly malnourished.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000f3b6mnxg23eqo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/media/pdfs/2025/05/HCP_Caring-for-Patients-with-Measles_Fact-Sheet_FINAL_3.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;measles treatment overview&lt;/a&gt; posted Thursday, the CDC says that “vitamin A may be used under the supervision of a healthcare provider” and that “other therapies, such as antibiotics should be prescribed based on clinical judgement by an individual healthcare provider.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000g3b6mpc8m6pyf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The overview also notes that although there’s no evidence to support routine use of antibiotics in someone with measles, they may be necessary if the person develops a secondary bacterial infection. Likewise, it says that patients with a history of certain airway conditions may be given inhaled steroids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000h3b6mbci3q0cf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/health/measles-misinformation-kff/index.html"&gt;A poll&lt;/a&gt; released last week showed that a growing share of adults in the US have heard false claims about measles and the vaccine, including that vitamin A can prevent infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000i3b6mf0szhpox@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s really important not to conflate what … [is] supportive or adjunctive care for measles versus curative treatment for measles,” Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician at PM Pediatrics in Annapolis, Maryland, told CNN in March.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000j3b6mgnv7hwoy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-budesonide-and-clarithromycin-unproven-and-risky/" target="_blank"&gt;a fact-check&lt;/a&gt; on its website, the American Academy of Pediatrics emphasizes that “Recent claims that budesonide and clarithromycin cure measles are reckless and put children at serious risk. There is no cure for measles. Immunization is the only way to prevent the spread of measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The common cold sore  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="159978" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;, which is often caught in childhood, usually stays in the body for life – quietly &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/herpes-simplex-virus"&gt;dormant&lt;/a&gt; in the nerves. Now and then, things like stress, illness or injury can trigger it, bringing on a cold sore in some people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this same virus – called herpes simplex virus type 1 – may also play an important role in something far more serious:  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="159978" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 30 years ago, my colleagues and I made a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(96)10149-5/abstract"&gt;surprising discovery&lt;/a&gt;. We found that this cold sore virus can be present in the brains of older people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155366" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155366" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ColdSore.jpg" alt="Cold Sore" class="size-full wp-image-155366" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ColdSore.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ColdSore-597x415.jpg 597w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ColdSore-600x417.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155366" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Herpes simplex virus type 1 hides out in our body from childhood – occasionally erupting as cold sores. (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_sore#/media/File:Herpes(PHIL_1573_lores).jpg"&gt;Wikimedia Commons/Public Domain&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the first clear sign that a virus could be quietly living in the brain, which was long thought to be completely germ-free – protected by the so-called "blood-brain barrier".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we discovered something even more striking. People who have a certain version of a gene (called APOE-e4) that increases their risk of Alzheimer's, and who have been infected with this virus, have a risk that is &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(96)10149-5/abstract"&gt;many times greater&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate further, we studied brain cells that we &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304394007010786?via%3Dihub"&gt;infected with the virus&lt;/a&gt;. They produced the same abnormal proteins (amyloid and tau) found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143082" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg" alt="Illustration of yellow clumps on pink nerve cells" class="size-full wp-image-143082" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of amyloid clumps on neurons. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADq3y9cbGY/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that the virus stays mainly dormant in the body for years – possibly decades. But later in life, as the immune system gets weaker, it can enter the brain and reactivate there. When it does, it will damage brain cells and trigger inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, repeated flare-ups could gradually cause the kind of damage that leads to Alzheimer's in some people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We later found the virus's DNA &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18973185/"&gt;inside the sticky clumps of these proteins&lt;/a&gt;, which are found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. Even more encouragingly, antiviral treatments reduced this damage in the lab, suggesting that drugs might one day help to slow or even prevent the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39956964/"&gt;Large population studies&lt;/a&gt; by others found that severe infections, specifically with the cold sore virus, was a strong predictor of Alzheimer's, and that specific antiviral treatment &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34136638/"&gt;reduced the risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research didn't stop there. We &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3233/JAD-220287"&gt;wondered if&lt;/a&gt; other  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="159978" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; that lie dormant in the body might have similar effects – such as the one responsible for chickenpox and shingles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_83894" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-83894" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/12/VSVirus-642x260.jpg" alt="Varicella zoster virus" class="wp-image-83894 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/12/VSVirus-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/12/VSVirus.jpg 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/12/VSVirus-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/12/VSVirus-600x243.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-83894" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Transmission electron microscope image of the varicella zoster virus. (Science Photo Library - HEATHER DAVIES/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Shingles vaccine offers another clue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we studied health records from hundreds of thousands of people in the UK, we saw something interesting. People who had shingles had only a slightly higher risk of developing dementia. Yet those who had the shingles vaccine were &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34625411/"&gt;less likely&lt;/a&gt; to develop dementia at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833335"&gt;new Stanford University-led study&lt;/a&gt; gave similar results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This supported our long-held proposal that preventing common infections could lower the risk of Alzheimer's. Consistently, studies by others showed that infections were indeed a risk and that some other vaccines were protective against Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scisignal.ado6430"&gt;then explored&lt;/a&gt; how risk factors for Alzheimer's such as infections and head injuries could trigger the hidden virus in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an advanced 3D model of the brain with a dormant herpes infection, we found that when we introduced other infections or simulated a brain injury, the cold sore virus reactivated and caused damage similar to that seen in Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when we used a treatment to reduce inflammation, the virus stayed inactive, and the damage didn't happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this suggests that the virus that causes cold sores could be an important contributor to Alzheimer's, especially in people with certain genetic risk factors. It also opens the door to possible new ways of preventing the disease, such as vaccines or antiviral treatments that stop the virus from waking up and harming the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What began as a link between cold sores and memory loss has grown into a much bigger story – one that may help us understand, and eventually reduce, the risk of one of the most feared diseases of our time.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/254656/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A young kollel wife in Yerushalayim, the daughter of a close talmid chacham friend, recently experienced a harrowing medical ordeal that nearly cost her life rachmana litzlan. Her story serves as an urgent warning about a medication commonly used in Eretz Yisroel but banned in the United States and many other countries.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This young American woman, living in Yerushalayim while her husband learns in kollel, was expecting her second child. After 33 grueling hours of labor at Hadassah Har Hatzofim Hospital, she required an emergency C-section when the fetal heart rate disappeared. Baruch Hashem, the baby was born healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the surgery, the hospital administered Optalgin (Metamizole) for pain management. This seems to be standard practice in Eretz Yisroel hospitals. This routine pain medication would soon prove to be the source of a life-threatening condition for my friend’s daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately one week after the birth, the new mother began experiencing severe pain. Upon returning to the hospital, doctors noted her white blood cell count was extremely low but dismissed it as a laboratory error. As days passed, her condition deteriorated dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the following Wednesday, her white blood cell count had plummeted to zero. She had no neutrophils – the white blood cells responsible for fighting infection. A normal neutrophil count ranges between 2,500 and 7,000 per microliter of blood. Without these critical cells, she was at extreme risk for infection, a condition known as agranulocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite multiple hospital admissions, injections to stimulate neutrophil production, and treatment with five different antibiotics, her condition remained critical. Eventually, she was transferred to the hematology ward, where, boruch Hashem, specialists identified the likely cause of her condition: an adverse reaction to Optalgin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Culprit: Optalgin (Metamizole)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metamizole, marketed in Eretz Yisroel as Optalgin by Teva Pharmaceuticals, is a common over-the-counter painkiller in Eretz Yisroel. It was first produced commercially in Germany in 1922 and was once available worldwide. However, after discovering its potential to cause agranulocytosis, approximately 30 countries – including the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, and most European Union nations – have banned or severely restricted its use.  Thirteen years ago, Israel’s Health Ministry, after a discussion by a panel of experts, decided not to prohibit the use of over-the-counter painkiller Optalgin or to make it a prescription drug, despite 4 serious cases that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA banned Metamizole in 1977 due to its potential to induce agranulocytosis, a potentially fatal condition with a mortality rate of approximately 24 percent of those who get the condition. Despite these international restrictions, the medication remains readily available over the counter in Eretz Yisroel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the hematologist who treated this young woman, foreign citizens who have never previously taken Optalgin may be particularly susceptible to this severe reaction. A European Medicines Agency report from December 2018 also suggests that genetic characteristics of certain populations may influence susceptibility to Optalgin-induced agranulocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After weeks of hospitalization, specialized treatment, and extensive medical intervention, the kollel wife’s white blood cell count finally rebounded, boruch Hashem. By the time she returned home, her newborn was six weeks old, and she had been separated from her toddler for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this ordeal, the young family experienced tremendous chessed from their community, with neighbors caring for their toddler and providing support – Mi k’amcha YEretz Yisroel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case highlights the importance of being an informed and proactive patient, especially when receiving medical care in a foreign country. It is this author’s belief that the Mitzvah of v’nishmartem me’od is fullfilled when patients: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1] Ask about all medications being administered, whether orally or intravenously&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2] Research unfamiliar medications, particularly those unavailable in their home country&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3] Request alternative treatments if uncomfortable with prescribed medications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk does appear to be higher with prolonged use and in women, though serious reactions can occur even after limited exposure.  Reactions are rare, but keep in mind that &lt;strong&gt;the FDA did ban it,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative pain relievers include acetaminophen (Tylenol/Acamol) and ibuprofen (Advil/Nurofen), though each carries its own risk profile. Ibuprofen has a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding with regular use, though with a much lower fatality rate than Optalgin-induced agranulocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Yidden from America and other countries continue to visit and settle in Eretz Yisroel, awareness of medications like Optalgin becomes increasingly important. What is routine medical practice in one country may carry unforeseen risks for visitors from another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of this young kollel wife serves as a powerful reminder that patients and parents (or children of older parents) must be vigilant about their medical care always. &lt;/p&gt;

There must be something in the air, or rather, in the formula, of this dermatologist, biochemist, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; facial plastic surgeon-approved pick. Let’s break it down. &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.schweigerderm.com/providers/nava-greenfield-md-fd/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.schweigerderm.com/providers/nava-greenfield-md-fd/"}' href="https://www.schweigerderm.com/providers/nava-greenfield-md-fd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nava Greenfield, MD,&lt;/a&gt; a board-certified dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology Group in New York City, ticks off its attributes: “This is soothing, as it contains aloe vera, and it’s nontoxic for the skin and environment,” she says. “It’s a mineral sunscreen free of harsh chemicals, and it has broad-spectrum coverage.” Aparovich praises the ingredients. “Featuring a safe mineral filter—zinc oxide—to shield the skin, it provides reliable broad-spectrum protection while rubbing smoothly into your skin,” she says. “A great pick for dry, normal, sensitive, and dehydrated skin, it’s packed with plant-based oils like shea butter and sunflower oil to nourish the skin and protect it from moisture loss.” She adds that it also has aloe barbadensis leaf extract to hydrate and soothe, and caprylic/capric triglyceride and squalane to moisturize the skin and strengthen its barrier. Another recommendation comes from Arnold Breitbart, MD, head plastic surgeon at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://faceliftlongislandny.com" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://faceliftlongislandny.com"}' href="https://faceliftlongislandny.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Long Island Facelift&lt;/a&gt;. “I’ve used Blue Lizard for years—way before the whole non-toxic sunscreen craze. It’s always been one of my go-tos,” he says. “It offers great sun protection, has no harsh chemicals, and it’s good on sensitive skin.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemical or Physical:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical (titanuim dioxide 8%, zinc oxide 10%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Organic aloe, shea butter, sunflower oil, caprylic/capric triglyceride, squalane&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPF Level:&lt;/strong&gt; 50&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Texture:&lt;/strong&gt; Lotion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 5 fl oz&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;EltaMD UV AOX Elements Broad-Spectrum SPF 50 Tinted Face Sunscreen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn jlHbNf callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/aokKbRGiuxPAtmptpJNicUADwGwXunMqC6TJpUEsDTJDAsh4Q43qgp24c6HYgQTGYwfEtC2q4bJX47s8c6T3RdHRAPJzxoooRLtR4J2iz5GKYPuoeDTS3J44HDpa7frVSbo3cWtP2S3CjyLJyEBEWX8fWzn9eaHNQrGWWBuh5f7kn3WD58MyBdCkzPjH711UTkNVadUrt3JTUnLKcpkBdK4zLkxsicc7EcPzaXvasuUvVRpG5CgnGgsRmwh77iq7Mbp4n5ig11k5PwzwpykJZRHA8wY2sc1Ve31MwBX4ruRNdpbQUgv","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"EltaMD","dangerousHed":"UV AOX Elements Broad-Spectrum SPF 50 Tinted Face Sunscreen","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"AMAZON","offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/EltaMD-Antioxidant-Protection-Environmental-Aggressors/dp/B079YXK3L8","contentType":"product","productId":"68122a2301acd72bc9d9fdf9","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":1,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"68122a2301acd72bc9d9fdf9","brand":{"name":"EltaMD"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/EltaMD-Antioxidant-Protection-Environmental-Aggressors/dp/B079YXK3L8","price":"$45","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/aokKbRGiuxPAtmptpJNicUADwGwXunMqC6TJpUEsDTJDAsh4Q43qgp24c6HYgQTGYwfEtC2q4bJX47s8c6T3RdHRAPJzxoooRLtR4J2iz5GKYPuoeDTS3J44HDpa7frVSbo3cWtP2S3CjyLJyEBEWX8fWzn9eaHNQrGWWBuh5f7kn3WD58MyBdCkzPjH711UTkNVadUrt3JTUnLKcpkBdK4zLkxsicc7EcPzaXvasuUvVRpG5CgnGgsRmwh77iq7Mbp4n5ig11k5PwzwpykJZRHA8wY2sc1Ve31MwBX4ruRNdpbQUgv","reducedPrice":"$36","sellerName":"AMAZON","countryCode":"US"}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;EltaMD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_68122a2301acd72bc9d9fdf9" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;UV AOX Elements Broad-Spectrum SPF 50 Tinted Face Sunscreen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It:&lt;/strong&gt; Ideal for sensitive skin, this tinted face sunscreen blurs imperfections in a range of skin tones while infusing the skin with health-boosting antioxidants.

An expert in eczema and psoriasis, she adds that the formula is soothing on skin that’s irritated from either condition. With a lightweight, fluid texture, the sunscreen sinks right into the skin, drying with a matte finish. It’s enriched with a bit of proprietary magic, too: La Roche-Posay’s Cell-Ox Shield technology combines UVA and UVB filters with antioxidant sun protection from tropical-leaf extracts. The brand’s signature ingredient—thermal spring water from the French town La Roche-Posay—is also present in the formula, bringing a soothing touch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemical or Physical:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical (titanium dioxide 6%, zinc oxide 5%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Vitamin E, botanical extracts, La Roche-Posay thermal spring water&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPF Level:&lt;/strong&gt; 50&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Texture:&lt;/strong&gt; Fluid&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1.7 fl oz&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Forah Everyday Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn jlHbNf callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/MqMVDRsypCNABGRAF3G9ShJzHnHMfw21qcGRBQ8uefVwJ9ZNKynTuqSgcEivopzQHW9ATb4nj6ofNsg4bP2xgQCc9xof5WgWFp3Sswj5gy57FsjtpTj9H1H1DKz1hL6gJNqaCsBRPCBJuBdzT1Lh93a1wGTQdXEjg1v3xCQpsLqfnnHpHErQTfMC9nyH5a8M3pK424VZ8ki7MXWyXGGpMLwK2cEP4BumCgv9QNTEnfhEDyAQtX6J6p4C2byLYrLTtCnCJwWzKkLJDvhtAJJmxzYX9UBgBfci","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"Forah","dangerousHed":"Everyday Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"MODA OPERANDI","offerUrl":"https://www.modaoperandi.com/beauty/p/forah/everyday-mineral-sunscreen/663791","contentType":"product","productId":"68122a238c2985de5f2e9cbe","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":3,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"68122a238c2985de5f2e9cbe","brand":{"name":"Forah"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.modaoperandi.com/beauty/p/forah/everyday-mineral-sunscreen/663791","price":"$55","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/MqMVDRsypCNABGRAF3G9ShJzHnHMfw21qcGRBQ8uefVwJ9ZNKynTuqSgcEivopzQHW9ATb4nj6ofNsg4bP2xgQCc9xof5WgWFp3Sswj5gy57FsjtpTj9H1H1DKz1hL6gJNqaCsBRPCBJuBdzT1Lh93a1wGTQdXEjg1v3xCQpsLqfnnHpHErQTfMC9nyH5a8M3pK424VZ8ki7MXWyXGGpMLwK2cEP4BumCgv9QNTEnfhEDyAQtX6J6p4C2byLYrLTtCnCJwWzKkLJDvhtAJJmxzYX9UBgBfci","sellerName":"MODA OPERANDI","countryCode":"US","reducedPrice":""},{"offerUrl":"https://goop.com/forah-everyday-mineral-face-sunscreen-spf-30/85-ml/p/","price":"$55","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/39ZGmWZ6fEZzHe7YCVBsPbWd3Z8y9YDDNAXuPTiE7vgKsDKX7hsdk5W91q7YRRhcdGbX5XSE7dXWBRLa5bvVnpQESiwyeW9gw6H3CC7NUpqeKMbiPjTGtS1duYCiWUfVk78muMsLg5tQ8iaXNerhDKDr3QQFW1nZ7J3PkqDqYE3ZfYcJm5yqkmTR9QDQpcUKCjicvGKPs6aSntLs9bm73D77BvPpKfLD2VhTLHznUAY8uFyfhGcGC1HN5vXM52YVv6KCfe9MQV4HUUcJg5g52Vc","sellerName":"GOOP","countryCode":"US","reducedPrice":""}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;Forah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_68122a238c2985de5f2e9cbe" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;Everyday Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It:&lt;/strong&gt; Like the Erewhon smoothie of sunscreens, Forah’s SPF 30 formula blends a cocktail of antioxidant-packed ingredients—think organic sea buckthorn oil, organic cold-pressed golden jojoba oil, and organic sweet almond oil—that &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; sound good enough to drink. (Please don’t, though.) Greenfield can hardly get enough of the luxurious, chicly packaged sun protection, which is also loaded with collagen-boosting botanical extracts. “It’s certified organic, which I love,” she says. “It has both zinc and titanium dioxide along with antioxidants, natural-based oils, and seaweed extract, which hydrate and protect the skin.

(In addition to the pinkish Original hue, the formula comes in the warm, golden Sunlit shade.) “While protecting your skin from sun damage, the smart formula also blends skincare ingredients like ceramides, peptides, galactoarabinan, bioflavonoids, allantoin, and glycoproteins,” Aparovich continues. “These moisturize and comfort the skin, and support its protective barrier throughout UV exposure.” She adds that the sunscreen works for dry and normal skin types, and is also suitable for sensitive skin. Pro tip: If using it as a makeup base, let the product dry for three to five minutes before layering it with other products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemical or Physical:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical (non-nano zinc oxide 21.7%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Ceramides, peptides, allantoin, hyaluronic acid&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPF Level:&lt;/strong&gt; 40&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Texture:&lt;/strong&gt; Fluid&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1.3 oz&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Colorescience Sunforgettable Total Protection Face Shield Flex SPF 50&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn jlHbNf callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/nntVzjQ3JMLounBBCrovvH9o7LcZBctrz8uZ7TYUsqJvV9xwePfNHrMLEsZWBqbLBkUpp7zQGTrdJVD3xqMB239o6c73Gjfdi6h3oyDioRApzbQTje2EyVqKEQiV26Pt7tjdWUuRGtWRqis4tY2tQSeMPNUVq6MV6sn2axGUzj52bJTrVtqBQShjUTgPPFVF64mCdPMkirfrQm52N39kYoGNTvgZbkwiT4YcxQJSatxbZVcAiakyUqX7udKueSUuM5m6t5Lf3vRp8nP2Y6Xa3KHc8SzKs3bmogKbP6Aa","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"Colorescience","dangerousHed":"Total Protection Flex SPF 50","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"AMAZON","offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Colorescience-Protection-Shield-Formula-Medium/dp/B093W7CDWD","contentType":"product","productId":"68122a23ab59d7b78e3f1246","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":5,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"68122a23ab59d7b78e3f1246","brand":{"name":"Colorescience"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Colorescience-Protection-Shield-Formula-Medium/dp/B093W7CDWD","price":"$54","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/nntVzjQ3JMLounBBCrovvH9o7LcZBctrz8uZ7TYUsqJvV9xwePfNHrMLEsZWBqbLBkUpp7zQGTrdJVD3xqMB239o6c73Gjfdi6h3oyDioRApzbQTje2EyVqKEQiV26Pt7tjdWUuRGtWRqis4tY2tQSeMPNUVq6MV6sn2axGUzj52bJTrVtqBQShjUTgPPFVF64mCdPMkirfrQm52N39kYoGNTvgZbkwiT4YcxQJSatxbZVcAiakyUqX7udKueSUuM5m6t5Lf3vRp8nP2Y6Xa3KHc8SzKs3bmogKbP6Aa","sellerName":"AMAZON","countryCode":"US","reducedPrice":""}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;Colorescience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_68122a23ab59d7b78e3f1246" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;Total Protection Flex SPF 50&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It:&lt;/strong&gt; With tone-adapting pigments, Colorescience’s smart SPF 50 comes in four shades ranging from Fair to Deep. “Combining skincare and sun protection, this tinted sunscreen adapts to various skin tones and provides a matte finish,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md"}' href="https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Marisa Garshick, MD, FAAD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified dermatologist in Manhattan and New Jersey.

“This Grown Alchemist SPF is not only non-toxic, it is a vegan formulation,” says Dr. Greenfield. “It uses natural ingredients such as rosehip oil, castor seed oil, lavender oil, coconut oil, and calendula for a hydrating and smooth application.” But moisturizing the skin isn’t its only capability. “This also has almost 20% zinc oxide for a tested and strong SPF,” Dr. Greenfield adds. The zinc oxide in question is ultra-sheer, so it vanishes into the skin without a trace—hence, the brand describes this hydrating salve as “invisible natural protection.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemical or Physical:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical (zinc oxide 19%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Castor seed oil, rosehip seed oil, lavender oil, parsley seed oil, candelilla wax, coconut oil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPF Level:&lt;/strong&gt; 30&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Texture:&lt;/strong&gt; Lightweight cream&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1.69 fl oz&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fig. 1 Mineral Sunscreen With Zinc Oxide&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn hxReXn callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/9fJ5Pb5roi2FBR7jmAU7qvp49uMDd91koJk937chytUFKQWEMrBb8y5j1mCnQgHTNrkf2YtNt1EJvHfaW5p5SWs7Zs8mVB1dGcM6Szhae4F19CDAmBF2WMsfLDNjJhwhSkcXkXKsRi3eqoPdE9XTudFhYpaN48nEAA1aJkTaWr6WddNHH1DVEkecCCxLFLaPeXg1VMdBX8PkYEUWYQyKzhWsxce7pE5YLvZgKQ6anio5ma2Vc1Zke3sYvuA9GZMAmAuYVDCFx","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"Fig.1","dangerousHed":"Mineral Sunscreen With Zinc Oxide","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"NORDSTROM","offerUrl":"https://www.nordstrom.com/s/mineral-sunscreen-spf-50/8330143","contentType":"product","productId":"68122a24209719135fb3562d","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":8,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"68122a24209719135fb3562d","brand":{"name":"Fig.1"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.nordstrom.com/s/mineral-sunscreen-spf-50/8330143","price":"$38","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/9fJ5Pb5roi2FBR7jmAU7qvp49uMDd91koJk937chytUFKQWEMrBb8y5j1mCnQgHTNrkf2YtNt1EJvHfaW5p5SWs7Zs8mVB1dGcM6Szhae4F19CDAmBF2WMsfLDNjJhwhSkcXkXKsRi3eqoPdE9XTudFhYpaN48nEAA1aJkTaWr6WddNHH1DVEkecCCxLFLaPeXg1VMdBX8PkYEUWYQyKzhWsxce7pE5YLvZgKQ6anio5ma2Vc1Zke3sYvuA9GZMAmAuYVDCFx","sellerName":"NORDSTROM","countryCode":"US","reducedPrice":""},{"offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Sunscreen-Invisible-Absorbing-Spectrum-Hyaluronic/dp/B0D5YT5H6D","price":"$29","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/2AtUUZ8dMcfSbovr3cnyWyC643bj2hmBJnYQnbFE5LjJNrRk1F2Kf41zHbs3nSy87zqR67iLUgmmQiFetVAa3FUmA37fPHagmVUvFFMAonJMUTfsHN5aQvzPQECdgbX45c53TZracWvYU2azSSsPNopXV8ifugmtPNttaWCmNLmWUnQr3aSgBtN4GqmaWJcNqHwEqmvPxu8WExt948CTFZeWSqQLCbz97c5oka71z1sF2BWtsqH7Nh996pc3gbqF6E782p6qbRned43eL7xhgXHxsER3r1pmoxvPa3Wgn7pBp","reducedPrice":"$23","sellerName":"AMAZON","countryCode":"US"}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;Fig.1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_68122a24209719135fb3562d" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;Mineral Sunscreen With Zinc Oxide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It:&lt;/strong&gt; Dermatologist-developed and clinically tested.

Squalane, triglycerides, and meadowfoam seed oil support the skin barrier, and bisabolol soothes the skin.” With a milky texture, the sunscreen blends into the skin with an undetectable finish, and the product is fragrance-free.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemical or Physical:&lt;/strong&gt;

According to Dr. Day, “Vanicream Facial Moisturizer with SPF 30 offers a practical, cost-effective solution for daily sun protection, particularly for individuals with sensitive skin.” She adds that Vanicream is a long-standing leader in hypoallergenic skincare and is known to formulate its sunscreens without common irritants. “This makes this product a dependable option for my eczema and psoriasis patients seeking broad-spectrum SPF in a well-tolerated, affordable moisturizer," she notes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemical or Physical:&lt;/strong&gt;

It means that neither UV filters nor any auxiliary ingredients, such as stabilizers, emulsifiers, film-forming agents, preservatives, or fragrances, can induce known or suspected hazards, including skin irritation and sensitization, allergic reactions, endocrine disruptions, genotoxicity, and more,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s commonly thought that, in sunscreens, “non-toxic” refers to mineral sunscreens only, Aparovich dispels the myth. “From a human safety standpoint, sunscreen formulas may include both mineral (physical) and/or organic (chemical) filters, with no adverse effects associated with them,” she stipulates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hIuJtK boBbyN"&gt;&lt;div id="traditional" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are non-toxic sunscreens as good as traditional sunscreens?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mineral or non-toxic sunscreens are just as effective as traditional sunscreens when used correctly,” says Dr. Day. “For my patients with eczema or psoriasis, I actually prefer them. They’re less likely to cause stinging, burning, or flares, and provide excellent broad-spectrum protection.” Just like any sunscreen, she says, non-toxic ones need to be applied generously and reapplied often, especially after sweating or swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hIuJtK boBbyN"&gt;&lt;div id="lookfor" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to Look for in a Non-Toxic Sunscreen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Aparovich advocates looking for a sunscreen formula suited to an individual’s skin type. “People with oily, combination, or acne-prone skin should opt for products free from comedogenic ingredients to avoid clogging pores and triggering inflammation, blackheads, or breakouts,” she says. These ingredients include cacao, palm, coconut, and wheat germ oils, and chemicals like cetylated lanolin alcohol, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl linoleate, isopropyl isostearate, isopropyl palmitate, myristyl lactate, myristyl myristate, laureth-4, oleyl alcohol, and ethylhexyl palmitate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are the ingredients with the highest comedogenicity rate,” she says. People with dry or sensitive skin should avoid harsh alcohols, such as alcohol, alcohol denat, ethanol, or SD alcohol, Aparovich adds. “These ingredients can compromise the skin’s barrier and cause irritation.” Additionally, she notes that an ideal non-toxic sunscreen should provide broad-spectrum protection to shield the skin from UVA and UVB rays and help reduce the risk of complex DNA damage in skin cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another key point is sunscreen’s sun protection factor, or SPF,” she says. “It indicates how effectively sunscreen can protect your skin from UVB rays, the ultraviolet light associated with sunburn.” Aparovich recommends choosing sunscreens with at least SPF 30, but ideally SPF 50, especially when the UV index is three or higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hIuJtK boBbyN"&gt;&lt;div id="naturalsunscreen" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a 100% natural sunscreen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Technically, there are sunscreens that claim to be 100% natural, but that term isn’t regulated,” Dr. Day says. “What matters more is that the product is clinically tested, well-tolerated by sensitive skin, and free of known irritants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hIuJtK boBbyN"&gt;&lt;div id="ingredients" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What ingredients should you avoid in sunscreen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Three of the most hazardous chemical filters to avoid are oxybenzone (benzophenone-3), homosalate, and octinoxate,” says Aparovich. “Studies have shown oxybenzone to be a common allergen, as well as an irritant to the eyes and skin, and a potential endocrine disruptor.” She adds that homosalate and octinoxate are linked to possible adverse effects on the endocrine system, and that all three ingredients have been shown to have a negative impact on marine life and coral reefs. Additionally, Aparovich recommends avoiding formaldehyde-releasing preservatives like Imidazolidinyl Urea, Quaternium 15, and Diazolidinyl Urea, along with fragrances classified as allergenic, such as cinnamal, citral, farnesol, coumarin, eugenol, geraniol, and others. “These chemicals can trigger allergic reactions and skin irritation,” she notes. Dr. Garshick recommends seeking paraben-free products, as the ingredient can irritate some skin types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hIuJtK boBbyN"&gt;&lt;div id="experts" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a data-offer-url="https://valerieaparovich.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://valerieaparovich.com/"}' href="https://valerieaparovich.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Valerie Aparovich&lt;/a&gt;

and announced at the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting, suggested that 92% of patients who used the new immunotherapy drug, dostarlimab, to shrink their tumors ,continued to be cancer-free for at least two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating cancer usually involves a form of immunotherapy alongside chemotherapy and surgery to remove a tumor. However, the new immuno-based treatment would only require a single step — immunotherapy — to treat the cancer by teaching a person’s immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hundred and three patients participated in the study, 54 with a variety of "solid tumor cancers," including stomach, endometrial and prostate, and 49 with rectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers shared in a &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/news/using-only-immunotherapy-successfully-treats-several-cancers-with-mmrd-mutation-improves-quality-of-life" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:press release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center that of the 54 patients with a “variety of cancers," 35 had “all signs of their cancer” disappear and were using the immuno-based treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith Collection/Gado/Getty &lt;/p&gt; Sign with logo on the facade of the Memorial Sloan Kettering cancer center in Manhattan, New York City, New York, among the top cancer hospitals in the world, September 14, 2017.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/milk-might-lower-womans-risk-of-colorectal-cancer-study-8772735" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Refrigerator Staple Might Lower a Woman's Risk of Colorectal Cancer, New Study Says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Refrigerator Staple Might Lower a Woman's Risk of Colorectal Cancer, New Study Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the release, Dr. Andrea Cercek said, "Nearly 2 out of 3 patients with types of cancer other than rectal were able to preserve their organs and their quality of life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a very significant response, and the results were even better than we had hoped,” Dr. Cercek said. “We found that some cancer types responded extremely well to the immunotherapy, including colon and stomach cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center&lt;/p&gt; Maureen Sideris, seated, with her sister Marion, receiving the 8th of 9 immunotherapy infusions during successful treatment for early-stage gastroesophageal junction cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maureen Sideris, a patient who was diagnosed with gastroesophageal junction cancer in 2022 and participated in the study, said that the treatment had worked successfully for her, according to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My husband, Tommy, and I were preparing for the worst,” she recalled in a statement. “But after being treated with only immunotherapy, I had no evidence of cancer and didn’t have to undergo surgery or chemo or radiation. I felt like I won the lottery!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cerek reported that “20% of non-rectal cancer patients” who still had to undergo surgery “saw lower rates of cancer recurrence."

Researchers said that one patient had a “growth in a lymph node” that was surgically removed but they “kept their rectum.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, researchers said that the new treatment comes with its own drawbacks as the immunotherapy drug appeared to only work well with patients who had mismatch repair-deficiency, which means certain cells have mutations when cancer cells separate, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/mismatch-repair-deficiency" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Cancer Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; (NCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the NCI, this mutation “is most common” in “colorectal cancer, other types of gastrointestinal cancer, and endometrial cancer" and can also be found in “cancers of the breast, prostate, bladder and thyroid.” The immunotherapy drug works by targeting cells with this mutation, as the immunotherapy drug can more easily target the many mutations, per the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re really excited to help more people,” Dr. Cercek said. “And we are already exploring why rectal tissue seems to have such an extraordinary response to immunotherapy and how we can use that knowledge to help with other cancer types.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/immunotherapy-breakthrough-could-mean-fewer-cancer-patients-need-chemo-11724110" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 22:05:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQYW0wMm9VT3B3ckN3TGktR3Y1VXlpSmhHR1lKWVp6WUZEczdFRHFsSURVMjNocWduQlpLXzFRbDVmVmlTQUNxeVZUamwyQVBhNC1mOEVyT0lYaW9HZzlTY1RSVDh0THNfV0Fac29fclhKSFgxVW9jX0xmQVBtUUlrTmctY21SQQ</guid></item><item><title>根据一项新研究，您应该多吃2种食物以减少炎症- EatingWell | 2 Foods You Should Eat More of to Lower Inflammation, According to a New Study - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFA4Vjc1eFVMSEpwbnVrNmVkeEdfVU9SMnBrZVJkZUkwaVowTmVPOHZrbTI4Y2t5ZkNGMW9nOVdHT2FybnhiY0xQQ25qOFEtUU5JV05ZVnBmcS1IdTdiNHF4S3h0YzBCdHpaZnVfeF9BbUU2ZTQ4S1o5R2FoZ2hSdnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that higher plant protein and fiber intake are linked with less inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High animal protein and low fiber intake were associated with more inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regardless of the level of total protein intake, higher levels of inflammation were seen in those with low fiber intake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Inflammation is the body’s healing response to injury or infection. When you sprain your ankle, it swells up because your body releases compounds to help it heal. As it heals, those inflammatory compounds are lessened. Similar processes happen when you get sick with an illness, except the inflammation may or may not be so obvious. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While inflammation is a necessary part of healing, when that inflammation doesn’t go away and becomes chronic, it raises your risk of disease, including heart disease, cancer, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Many things can cause chronic inflammation, including stress and diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers in the United Kingdom took a closer look at diet—specifically, protein sources and fiber—and how they relate to inflammation. They published their findings in April 2025 in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break them down.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The data in this study came from the UK Biobank, a large database that contains medical, lifestyle and health information from about 500,000 UK residents. For this study, researchers used data from 128,612 participants who were at least 60 years old and fit the study criteria. The research team only included participants who had dietary data and bloodwork that included C-reactive protein (CRP) levels on file. CRP is a common measurement of inflammation in the body. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers categorized participants into two groups: individuals who had one or no chronic health conditions (based on a list of 43 such conditions) and individuals who reported having two or more of those chronic conditions, which is referred to as multimorbidity. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Based on food diaries from the participants, researchers recorded total protein intake for the participants and split the protein up between animal protein and plant protein. For this study, plant protein included tempeh, tofu, beans (legumes), lentils, nuts and seeds. Animal protein included red meat, poultry, eggs, fish and dairy. In addition, participants’ fiber intake was calculated. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers adjusted for factors like age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, smoking status, alcohol intake, height and weight. Participants self-reported medical diagnoses from a list of 43 conditions. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Based on their dietary information and CRP levels, participants were divided into groups: high total protein, low total protein, high dietary fiber and low dietary fiber. These groups were further split up, with low, middle and high categories in plant protein, animal protein and dietary fiber. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After statistical analyses were run, researchers found that plant-based protein and high-fiber foods may help lower inflammation in the body. Specifically, they observed that: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Participants eating a diet low in fiber and high in animal proteins experienced higher inflammation levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Among participants with high, middle and low protein intake, higher inflammation levels were always observed for those who &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; had low fiber intake. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In those without multimorbidity (two or more chronic diseases), higher plant protein and fiber intake resulted in lower levels of inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; multimorbidity (two or more chronic illnesses), the association between protein, fiber and inflammation was stronger compared to those without multimorbidity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, as plant protein and fiber intake increased, inflammation levels decreased. The opposite was found regarding animal protein and total protein, which exhibited a significant positive association with C-reactive protein (CRP), which was measured to gauge inflammation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There were a few limitations to this study. First, the study population was largely white British older adults, so it is unknown if these results also apply to other populations. It’s also worth noting that when participants self-report their conditions and dietary habits, there’s always a chance that some data may be incomplete or misremembered. Lastly, CRP levels were only measured at baseline, so they might not be indicative of ongoing chronic inflammation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We know that inflammation plays a starring role in chronic illness. The trick is finding out what’s causing it. This study suggests that consuming high amounts of animal protein and too little fiber are associated with higher levels of inflammation, but that higher intakes of fiber and plant protein are linked with less inflammation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber plays an important role in gut health, providing food for beneficial gut bacteria. There is evidence that a healthy gut microbiome is linked with lower inflammation levels, so it makes sense that plant protein and other sources of fiber would be associated with lower CRP levels. And this relationship is bi-directional—gut health influences inflammation, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/does-inflammation-harm-your-gut-health-8715529" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation influences gut health&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If this is all overwhelming, a good place to start is with gut health. We know that fiber feeds the beneficial gut bacteria and plant protein provides fiber, so start there. What sources of plant protein can you add to your diet? Where can you swap an animal protein meal with a plant protein one? &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-foods-with-more-protein-than-an-egg-8424134" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Higher protein plant sources&lt;/a&gt; include legumes, nuts, seeds, tofu, tempeh and certain whole grains, like quinoa and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/didietitian-favorite-high-protein-whole-grain-amaranth-8401947" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;amaranth&lt;/a&gt;. This weeklong &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7826129/plant-based-meal-plan-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;plant-based diet meal plan&lt;/a&gt; provides a framework to get you going. Use it as is or pick out a few recipes to try. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other plants—including &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8004966/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-enough-fruits-vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fruits, vegetables&lt;/a&gt; and whole grains—even if they aren’t considered high-protein, are also important to include for overall good health and gut health, as they provide fiber, antioxidants and essential vitamins and minerals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You also need plenty of beneficial bacteria—aka probiotics—to nosh on the fiber you’re feeding them. You can add probiotics with fermented foods, so add a little sauerkraut or kimchi to your diet each day. If that’s not appealing, then go with yogurt or kefir.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another limitation of this study is that it didn’t break down healthier sources of animal proteins from less healthy ones. For example, yogurt and kefir are sources of animal proteins that provide probiotics and other necessary nutrients, including calcium and vitamin D. And fish and other seafood provide &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920'" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;brain- and heart-healthy omega-3s&lt;/a&gt; in addition to protein. But these proteins were all lumped together with other sources of animal proteins, even though they provide a wealth of essential nutrients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We believe that all foods can fit into a balanced, varied diet. So, for example, while you might not want to eat a hamburger each day, now and then is probably fine. Instead of cutting things out, focus on packing your diet with nutrient-dense foods that have been linked with lower levels of inflammation and disease—like plant protein—while sprinkling in other foods you enjoy on occasion—like a burger. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other lifestyle habits have also been linked with better gut health and lower levels of inflammation, including exercise and lower levels of stress. So, move your body more often and examine the areas where stress needs to be lowered. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; suggests that higher plant protein and fiber intake is associated with lower levels of inflammation, and that higher intakes of animal protein and lower fiber intake are linked with higher levels of inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eating more plants, including high-protein plants, is important for overall health and disease prevention.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Find easy ways to add more plant protein and fiber into your diet and start swapping animal protein for plant protein here and there. Some tasty ways to do this are by replacing the meat in tacos with tofu, like we do in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7891013/chipotle-tofu-tacos/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chipotle Tofu Tacos&lt;/a&gt;, or beans, like in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/crispy-sheet-pan-black-bean-tacos-11699837" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Crispy Sheet-Pan Black Bean Tacos&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;

Kennedy Jr. reprised various misleading claims about vaccines this week, including that the measles vaccine contains cells from aborted fetuses and the mumps vaccination does not work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy's comments come as the U.S. battles one of its worst outbreaks of measles in 25 years. Scientists have warned that the U.S. is at a tipping point for the return of endemic measles, declared eradicated nationally in 2000, and say U.S. public health officials like Kennedy should provide urgent endorsement for highly effective vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Two children have died and hundreds more have been infected in the outbreak in Texas, which is centered in a Mennonite community and has spread to neighboring states, including New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy, who became the nation's top health official in February, has for decades helped sow doubts regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccines, contributing to a decline in vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy says he is not opposed to vaccines, but has begun to revive some of the unproven or debunked theories he promoted as a lawyer and public figure, now from his perch at the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"There are populations in our country, like the Mennonites in Texas, (who) were most afflicted, and they have religious objections to the vaccination, because the MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris and DNA particles, so they don't want to take it," he said in a News Nation interview on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy was referring to the combined Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine. The vaccines do not contain "fetal debris" from abortions or intact fetal cells, vaccine experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The rubella portion of the vaccine is produced from a fetal cell line originating from an abortion that took place in the 1960s. The MMR vaccine does not contain the cells in its final form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The cells are derived from fetal cells that have been replicated over decades in test tubes in laboratory settings, thousands of times removed from the original ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The virus is grown in these cells, then this virus is purified, meaning everything other than the virus is filtered out, and all that's left is this attenuated virus that can't make you sick," said Dr. Miriam Laufer, Interim Director of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to a fact sheet on how vaccines are made from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia at the University of Pennsylvania, the amount of DNA involved in final vaccine preparation is minimal; billionths or trillionths of a gram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"While the final vaccines do not contain intact fetal cells, they may contain trace amounts of cell-derived materials, such as fragments of DNA," said Dr. Paulo Verardi, Professor of Virology and Vaccinology and the University of Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy also said this week that the mumps portion of the vaccine does not work and that there were safety concerns over it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The problem is really with the mumps portion of the vaccine and the combination. That combination was never safety tested," he said on Monday at a live televised town hall event hosted by TV host Dr. Phil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Two doses of the MMR vaccine provide around 86% protection against mumps, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While it is true that vaccine protection can wane over time, the rate varies depending on the disease and vaccine, Verardi and other vaccine experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"For mumps in particular, immunity can decline, so adults vaccinated in childhood may become susceptible again. Still, vaccinated individuals generally experience a milder illness if infected, which is still a key benefit of vaccination," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;(Reporting by Ahmed Aboulenein in Washington and Nancy Lapid in Tucson; Additional reporting by Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago; Editing by Caroline Humer and Stephen Coates)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 21:42:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxQeFhBcHVfT29vSmNQRExlaUlKSGtxNXRkQTA5Qmo1bkEwUE9LUVM0ZTJydnpNYm9UcHlYeVl1MFh4bTJkd21kNmZuS1RZb1AwVGRXVXhZeEhqNHI3NXNIdExUWV9ObW5sc1ZEakNJTy1ET3Z6M094MVdUWmxVdk1POU5ZUQ</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr计划对“所有新疫苗”进行安慰剂试验测试- BBC | RFK Jr plans placebo-trial testing for 'all new vaccines' - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9Eb0s0YzFWR1pXRWhERWFYLUFCSWRYWVVvR0J4RXB5NDJycDRDRDdoLWFkaW5UY0VSVnlnd3E2Q0Z5TVhDMWJMal96akpCak5HeURmWVR3ZVFJUdIBX0FVX3lxTE5nTEtuSHhfV01rOVNkS3NvQ1IwQm9EV0NpWmxXMlR2cXZGVzhFMDBTa0YwNXdkM1hNVmw4LWJ1V0NzLV9SUGIzdHoxNmpyTFhBaW9ZY1RXVHJwQnlLdDdR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The top US health department plans to require placebo testing for all vaccines in an effort to offer "straightforward" public health information, but experts say such testing could limit availability and raise ethical concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In a statement first given to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said this week, "All new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure — a radical departure from past practices". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The agency did not provide details on which "new vaccines" would be included. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But officials have suggested that updated Covid-19 shots may be included, which vaccine experts say could slow down vaccine access.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Peter Lurie, a former official with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said "it's hard to tell exactly what is being proposed."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"But, broadly, if they mean that every modification to an existing vaccine would require a new placebo-controlled trial, they are treading in ethically dubious territory and likely to deny Americans life-saving vaccines at some point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;HHS has not offered details on the timing of the placebo plan or specify the vaccines involved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;An HHS spokesperson told the BBC in a statement that health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's goal of "radical transparency" means being "honest and straightforward about what we know — and what we don't know — about medical products, including vaccines". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The statement said none of the childhood vaccines recommended in the US  - except the Covid shot - had undergone "inert placebo" testing, meaning "we know very little about the actual risk profiles of these products". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But public health experts say the statement is misleading, as childhood vaccinations, including ones for Hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, polio and the mumps, were all initially tested against a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, all new immunizations already go through the trials - a type of random testing where one test group receives the immunization, and the other gets a placebo, like a saline shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But newer versions of the shots may not go through the same process, because it is considered unethical to withhold a shot known to be safe from a particular group, and because the shot is only being tweaked in a minor way, vaccine experts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The coronavirus shot, for example, already has gone through rigorous safety testing, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We have a lot of information about the safety of the vaccine," he said. "All we're doing this year is using a different Omicron variant that we used last year and the year before that." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Still, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said this week that the agency was "taking a look" at updated coronavirus shots, telling the BBC's US partner CBS News that there is a "void of data". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;An HHS spokesperson told the BBC that "significant updates to existing vaccines" may be considered "new products" requiring additional clinical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"A four-year-old trial is also not a blank check for new vaccines each year without clinical trial data, unlike the flu shot which has been tried and tested for more than 80 years," the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Requiring companies to conduct placebo tests for simple upgrades of established vaccines would be costly - and the drug makers could ultimately decide to forgo making the newer, more effective versions of the vaccine altogether, said Dr Lurie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Before taking office - and since assuming the role as secretary - Kennedy has spread   false claims about vaccine safety. His tenure has coincided with one of the worst measles outbreaks in a decade; two children have died and 660 people have been infected in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This week, he encouraged parents to "do their own research" about the measles vaccine - which has been considered safe and 97% effective for decades - and raised questions about whether the shot could cause seizures or neurological issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For months, he has at times endorsed the MMR shot, and at other times, called it a "personal" decision. Kennedy also promoted alternative treatments, which doctors say patients should not use without medical supervision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 21:36:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9Eb0s0YzFWR1pXRWhERWFYLUFCSWRYWVVvR0J4RXB5NDJycDRDRDdoLWFkaW5UY0VSVnlnd3E2Q0Z5TVhDMWJMal96akpCak5HeURmWVR3ZVFJUdIBX0FVX3lxTE5nTEtuSHhfV01rOVNkS3NvQ1IwQm9EV0NpWmxXMlR2cXZGVzhFMDBTa0YwNXdkM1hNVmw4LWJ1V0NzLV9SUGIzdHoxNmpyTFhBaW9ZY1RXVHJwQnlLdDdR</guid></item><item><title>HHS吹捧通用流感，冠状病毒疫苗计划，同时对季节性Covid-19疫苗的未来表示怀疑- CNN | HHS touts universal flu, coronavirus vaccine initiative while casting doubt on future of seasonal Covid-19 shots - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPMUV4UDhZczFpbklBcDZka3dTZE1zMFBFdVVONlBkNFN3c0hXR3VFMWNrUG81MDc5ZGJBcDlMYURXa0pnRU1pb01ZZ1ozcW9OWGlnazQtMHJOclB5c0pUSnRkRTRyYmUtNUl6bW5xcTdsNlJmcUJsalJ1UHpKaU56ZTVORlVNRllacTROeS1Hc9IBlAFBVV95cUxOZ0ZUY2xTYjVoOEJfcGJaZVZVV1lQYk5xVFJBYzNxTGdTVVZnQzVMMXIwbmlWRVZ5UHFaSms2UDhRN3lmMXNzZHVCZURwVHVwVlJrM1NzN2phZTRmRGVVaUJVZkt6SXZ1LXRHRU1rUDJzSTJianpvMFdCTUxEM25YRmtMSDNndGZQSkx5c3hpSWZPekhk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            The US Department of Health and Human Services said Thursday that it aims to accomplish within four years a scientific feat that hasn’t been achieved&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for the past 45: the development of a universal flu vaccine that could protect against multiple virus strains with pandemic potential, including H5N1 avian influenza.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00022e6a0aeu0g9q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Generation Gold Standard is a paradigm shift,” National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said in a &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-nih-announces-generation-gold-standard.html" target="_blank"&gt;statement &lt;/a&gt;on the new initiative. “It extends vaccine protection beyond strain-specific limits and prepares for flu viral threats – not just today’s, but tomorrow’s as well – using traditional vaccine technology brought into the 21st century.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00032e6a61zknvgv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS said the project, being developed in-house at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is targeting US Food and Drug Administration approval of universal influenza vaccines in 2029, with human clinical trials scheduled to start next year. The Wall Street Journal first reported that it will be funded with $500 million from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a figure confirmed by a spokesperson for HHS.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00042e6aqpdv4zvk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I hope it works,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine scientist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. He noted that he trained in a flu lab in the early 1980s that was working on a universal flu vaccine, and one still hasn’t been developed. “It’s not for lack of effort, and it’s not for lack of expertise, and it’s not for lack of money that we don’t have a universal influenza vaccine. It’s just really hard to do.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00052e6adojvt4q1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu viruses are wily because they mutate from season to season, sometimes significantly, and because efforts to protect against all – or many – strains at once haven’t succeeded, we get updated flu shots each year to protect us against the latest circulating strains.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00062e6aua4xa41p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A similar paradigm has unfolded for Covid-19 vaccines since they were first authorized in the height of the pandemic at the end of 2020. HHS’s new initiative also aims to develop universal coronavirus vaccines that could provide protection against not just the virus that causes Covid-19 – SARS-CoV-2 – but its cousins SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00072e6abhm5b8uh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vaccine technology in HHS’s new initiative uses inactivated whole-virus vaccines, an older approach that delivers an entire virus that’s been chemically tweaked so it can’t infect human cells. The project comes from work being driven by Dr. Matthew Memoli, the NIH’s principal deputy director, and Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger, acting director of NIAID.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00082e6avjt9q1u8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Memoli, who &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/24/health/nih-interim-director-memoli/index.html"&gt;gained attention&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 for opposing Covid-19 vaccine mandates and reportedly declined Covid-19 vaccination himself, said in &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/trial-potential-universal-flu-vaccine-opens-nih-clinical-center" target="_blank"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt; that one of the vaccines being advanced in this project, which can potentially be administered through a squirt up the nose, is an attempt “to induce a comprehensive immune response that closely mimics immunity gained following a natural influenza infection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00092e6aln93g0hb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine experts who are not involved in the project said universal flu and coronavirus vaccines are a worthy goal, but they questioned whether this project could produce one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000a2e6a6djbjb6o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Greg Poland, who directs the vaccine research group at the Mayo Clinic, said the accepted scientific definition of a universal flu vaccine is one that would provide at least 75% protection against symptomatic infection with both A and B strain flu viruses for at least a year, and preferably over multiple seasons, for all age groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000b2e6ase877hqe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Poland says &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abo2167" target="_blank"&gt;research that’s been published&lt;/a&gt; on the most advanced candidate in the new initiative, BPL-1357, describes a vaccine that contains inert versions of four A-strain avian influenza viruses but doesn’t include any B-strain viruses, “which tells me they’re not aiming at seasonal viruses,” he said. “They’re aiming at those viruses that have the potential for pandemicity,” or the potential to start pandemics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000c2e6av2p3aj0z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Poland said he was also surprised by the amount of money being devoted to a vaccine technology that science has largely moved away from.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000d2e6a30iclfc8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Why would we devise a major program and devote a tremendous amount of resources to an old platform?” he asked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5qxpnw00003b6mscvltou0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The advantage of using whole viruses is that they give the body a chance to develop antibodies to many parts of a virus, which tends to create long-lasting protection, even if some parts of the virus mutate. But they can also cause unwanted side effects and adverse reactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5rvfok00003b6mcv0d3ny1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whole virus vaccines are typically grown in chicken eggs or cells. In this case, the vaccines under study are grown in canine kidney cells. Those viruses are treated with a chemical called beta-propiolactone, which prevents them from being able to copy themselves in the body and infect cells. The inactivated viruses are then purified and mixed into a shot or nasal spray.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5r6xwi00023b6mgwt4faw9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US used to use flu vaccines made from whole inactivated viruses but has since &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8473132/" target="_blank"&gt;moved to safer options&lt;/a&gt;, such as subunit or split virus vaccines, which use only a part of the flu virus to create an immune response. Flumist, a nasal spray, uses a whole but weakened version of the virus, so it’s not completely inactivated. Inactivated whole-virus flu vaccines are still used in some other countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000e2e6avupyvwey@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Poland and another vaccine expert, Dr. Peter Hotez, director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, said whole-virus vaccines were once more common, but developers moved away from them because they produce inoculations that are sometimes too strong and can provoke dangerous immune reactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5t2pa0000g3b6mi9g3nlmi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m guessing it’s going to be quite reactogenic,” Hotez said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000f2e6ald1wh0wn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He pointed to the 1976 swine flu vaccine, which produced a strong immune response to the whole virus it contained but also caused high rates of Guillain-Barré syndrome, an immune disorder in which the body attacks its own nerves and muscles, causing muscle weakness and paralysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000g2e6ax8dtflg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other whole-virus vaccines, including the first ones developed to fight respiratory syncytial virus or RSV, have caused problems such as immune enhancement, where exposure to the virus after vaccination makes the infection more dangerous, not less.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000h2e6aoccdpuuk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a bit of a head-scratcher why they have so much confidence in a whole inactivated virus approach. I don’t quite understand that,” Hotez said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5r89m1000b3b6m5v7vvzeg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Just before it announced its new universal vaccine development plan, late Wednesday HHS threw into question the future of seasonally updated Covid-19 vaccines. The agency said in a statement that “all new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure – a radical departure from past practices.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000o2e6aoa2obk0u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The FDA typically selects strains for updated Covid-19 vaccines in June so manufacturers can ready them for the fall respiratory virus season. The agency has adopted a system similar to the one used for flu vaccines, holding previously that updating only the strain targeted by the vaccine – and nothing else – didn’t represent a change big enough to require new human trials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000p2e6aoprfax5m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If HHS now requires placebo-controlled trials before clearing updated Covid-19 vaccines, experts said, that could delay availability of the shots by months, putting vulnerable people at risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000q2e6a7m4zlnyi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The advantage of updating the vaccine every year to make it more close to the circulating strain is, you get better antibody responses, so for four to six months, you will clearly have better protection against mild to moderate disease, and that matters especially for people who are more frail,” particularly people 75 and older, Offit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000r2e6am4tf0spr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A spokesperson for HHS didn’t respond to an inquiry about whether the new guidance pertains to updated Covid-19 vaccines, but an official told CNN on Saturday that “the covid vaccines, including new ones by Pfizer and Moderna, are new and must have more gold standard science to ensure safety and efficacy for the public.” The official drew a distinction from the flu shot, “which has been tried and tested” for decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000s2e6a2vt8694e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Questions about the fate of Covid vaccines began to swirl after the FDA missed an April 1 deadline to decide whether to grant full approval to the Novavax vaccine, the only non-mRNA vaccine available to protect against the coronavirus. A source familiar with the situation, who wasn’t authorized to speak on behalf of the agency, told CNN that the vaccine had been on track to be approved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000t2e6azkl4nqga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Novavax later &lt;a href="https://ir.novavax.com/press-releases/Latest-update-on-U-S-FDA-BLA-for-Novavaxs-COVID-19-Vaccine-1" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://ir.novavax.com/press-releases/Latest-update-on-U-S-FDA-BLA-for-Novavaxs-COVID-19-Vaccine-1" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;the FDA had requested a “postmarketing commitment” for a clinical trial, suggesting that a study would be required of the vaccine after it received full approval (it had been available through emergency use authorization since 2022). HHS’s newest statement adds to questions about whether a trial would be required before approval, not just for Novavax’s vaccine but also for updated versions of those from Moderna and Pfizer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000u2e6aclty21n9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a conference call with Wall Street analysts Thursday, Moderna President Dr. Stephen Hoge insisted that the company’s interactions with the FDA so far have been “business as usual” and emphasized the “real need for Covid vaccination, particularly this coming fall.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr000v2e6av1k4m2ds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Covid-19 has become less deadly since the height of the pandemic as the population developed widespread immunity through both infection and vaccination, but the virus still kills and can be especially dangerous for the elderly. Between September 2023 and August 2024, there were more than 36,000 deaths from Covid-19 among people 65 and older, CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-04-15-16/05-Panagiotakopoulos-COVID-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-04-15-16/05-Panagiotakopoulos-COVID-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;showed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr000w2e6aia4llo2e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This month may reveal whether the FDA shares Moderna’s “business as usual” approach. The company is expecting FDA decisions on a next-generation Covid-19 vaccine by May 31 and on an expansion of approval for its RSV vaccine into younger ages by June 12. It said an FDA decision on its combination flu and Covid-19 vaccine would be pushed back from the end of this year to 2026, as the agency said it requires efficacy data on the flu component to support the application.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr000x2e6ax3c6uzlh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The company also said it’s going to “de-prioritize” development of the combination flu and Covid-19 vaccine for people under the age of 50, instead focusing on advancing it for older adults, as it shifts some resources to cancer therapies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cma5pxsao001f2e6a9lnjwg4e@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="changing-standards-may-delay-shots" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Changing standards may delay shots
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr000y2e6a0gl1hpeq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If the FDA does require placebo-controlled trials before approving updated seasonal Covid-19 vaccines, experts said, it will signal a new standard.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr000z2e6agyz844vg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “FDA clearly, after a deliberative process, adopted an approach that treated Covid-19 vaccine boosters like influenza boosters, not like a new product, and held to that over a few years,” said Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at UC Law San Francisco. “They adopted a standard, and now they’re changing it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr00102e6afm9653dn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The agency does appear to be moving forward at least with the process of selecting strains; it’s asked its group of outside advisers to hold May 22 as a date to meet to discuss them, according to a person who viewed the communication who wasn’t authorized to speak on behalf of the FDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr00112e6amljitbmi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In its statement Wednesday, HHS also claimed that current systems for monitoring vaccine safety, including the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and the Vaccine Safety Datalink, don’t capture vaccine injuries sufficiently and “have become templates of regulatory malpractice.” HHS said it’s building surveillance systems now “that will accurately measure vaccine risks as well as benefits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr00122e6a51qqpznu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine experts pushed back on the assertion that those systems are insufficient. And the plan to build a different surveillance system appeared to come into direct conflict with a pledge that Sen. Bill Cassidy said HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made to secure his confirmation vote in February.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr00132e6a5yy5upio@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, Cassidy &lt;a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-delivers-floor-speech-in-support-of-rfk-jr-to-be-hhs-secretary/" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the time, has “committed that he would work within the current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems, and not establish parallel systems.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr00142e6au5v8nza2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cassidy, a Republican doctor from Louisiana, did not respond to CNN’s request for comment Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria — the powerhouses of cells — carry unique DNA that is mutated in specific diseases, causing cells to be starved of energy. Now, scientists have uncovered a first-of-its-kind molecule that can reverse the effects of common mutations behind these genetic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They [the mutations] can cause very different diseases for which no cure is available," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cesne.biologia.unipd.it/research-groups/carlo-viscomi/" target="_blank" data-url="https://cesne.biologia.unipd.it/research-groups/carlo-viscomi/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Carlo Viscomi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor in the University of Padova's Department of Biomedical Science and Padua Neuroscience Center in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the paper really makes a breakthrough," said Viscomi, who was not involved in the research but previously collaborated with some of the authors. "It may open amazing possibilities for these conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One limitation of the work is that it did not demonstrate how well the molecule works in a living animal or person, Viscomi said.

These rare, inherited conditions affect an estimated 1 in 10,000 people worldwide and are caused by mutations in the POLG gene, which codes for a key protein in mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-eeHbQV6DbAwkTseVDQSFtG" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-eeHbQV6DbAwkTseVDQSFtG slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DNA within mitochondria needs to be replicated as new mitochondria are made. Mitochondrial DNA must also be repaired after factors like &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-oxidative-stress" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-oxidative-stress"&gt;&lt;u&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; damage it. However, around &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9289853/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9289853/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;300 different mutations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the POLG gene derail this replication-and-repair process by messing with the enzyme tasked with the job: polymerase gamma (POLG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POLG mutants spur harmful mutations to accumulate in mitochondrial DNA, cause chunks of the DNA to be deleted over time, or both. POLG diseases result in a wide range of symptoms that vary among people and progress at different rates depending on which mutations a person carries and how many copies they've inherited from their parents. "It's extremely variable," Viscomi told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK540966/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK540966/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most severe POLG diseases, typically starts triggering symptoms between age 2 and 4; causes liver failure and seizures; and kills within four years of symptom onset. Some POLG-related diseases emerge earlier, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/genetics/articles/10.3389/fgene.2021.664278/full" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/genetics/articles/10.3389/fgene.2021.664278/full" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;shortly after birth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while others arise later, between the ages of 12 and 40, or even after 40. Those whose symptoms arise after 40 have the best prognosis and fairly mild symptoms at first, including droopy eyelids and eye-muscle weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, people with POLG diseases survive &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9289853/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9289853/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;between three months and 12 years&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after their symptoms first begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because hundreds of mutations trigger these conditions, they would be challenging to address with gene-editing approaches, like &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CRISPR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/gisbl/pi/mdnar" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/gisbl/pi/mdnar" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;William Copeland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a senior investigator and head of the Mitochondrial DNA Replication Group at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in the U.S., who was not involved in the study. For that reason, various groups &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30848931/" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30848931/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;have explored&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(24)00319-5/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(24)00319-5/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;using small molecules&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5618494/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5618494/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;to treat the diseases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with limited success, he told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes the new study unique is that it has introduced the "first drug specifically targeted against mutant forms of the POLG gene," Copeland said. And at least in lab-dish experiments, the drug appears to "significantly" improve the function of the POLG protein, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/why-does-the-brain-use-so-much-energy" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/why-does-the-brain-use-so-much-energy"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We finally know why the brain uses so much energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="hunt-for-a-promising-drug-3"&gt;Hunt for a promising drug&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers theorized that if they could find a drug that enhanced the activity of healthy POLG, the same drug might work on mutant versions, too. They began by screening a diverse collection of 270,000 compounds to see how they impacted the activity of healthy POLG. This revealed one promising molecule that the team then chemically tweaked, to increase its potency, and tested on common mutants. They dubbed the optimized version of the molecule PZL-A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, the researchers focused on just four POLG mutants, rather than studying all 300. However, about 70% of people with POLG diseases carry at least one of these four mutations, they noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used a technique called cryogenic electron microscopy to reveal in fine detail how the molecule interacted with each mutant and with healthy POLG. The protein is composed of three parts that fit together: one "A" component and two "B" components. The analysis revealed that the PZL-A compound sits in a pocket between A and B. That pocket happens to be "unaffected by the most common disease-causing [POLG] mutations," the authors noted in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By binding there, the molecule enhances the overall stability of the protein; this, in turn, boosts its ability to replicate and repair DNA, regardless of whether a mutation is present. "They didn't test all the existing mutations, but the mutations they tested, they seem all to be 'rescued,' in a sense, by using this compound," Viscomi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers backed up these initial findings by running lab-dish experiments with cells from patients with the four common mutations they explored. First, the researchers depleted the mitochondrial DNA in the cells, to see how quickly the cells could recover that lost DNA. Cells treated with the compound recovered their DNA far faster than untreated cells did, and even kept up with the healthy version of the protein in some experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wasn't prepared for this outcome — that we would actually find one stone that will kill all these birds," Gustafsson said. "But we did."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copeland agreed, saying, "I'm surprised that such a small molecule can stabilize the mutant forms of POLG," as well as stabilize and alter the activity of healthy versions of the protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team has begun testing the compound on additional POLG mutants. So far, they've found that "we see effects in many of these other mutations," Gustafsson said. That recent work has yet to be published. Meanwhile, the clinical trial has just begun to test a molecule that is "structurally very much related" to PZL-A, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinical trials will be needed to see if the newfound compound causes any unacceptable side effects and whether it has the expected effects in humans, Copeland said. If it does prove safe and effective, "I'm assuming the patient would have to be on continuous treatment for the duration of their life," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a treatment would fulfill an unmet need for people with these diseases, as current treatments are not aimed at curing the conditions but at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8796686/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8796686/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;managing patients' symptoms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Viscomi and Gustafsson both noted that the depletion of mitochondrial DNA is tied to diseases of aging, including neurodegenerative conditions. So it may be that, beyond POLG diseases, scientists could explore additional applications for the compound.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration looks to be surrendering in the war against germs. A new report from Wired reveals the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has shuttered a federal lab dedicated to studying some of the deadliest infectious diseases in the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Wired’s report, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/hhs-niaid-irf-ebola-disease-research-stop/"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday, the Integrated Research Facility in Frederick, Maryland was ordered to completely cease its experimental research by April 29. The facility has long researched the treatment and prevention of “high consequence” infectious diseases, including Ebola and Lassa fever. The facility’s ultimate fate is uncertain at this time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/frederick-integrated-research-facility#:~:text=It%20is%20one%20of%20the%20few%20facilities%20in%20the%20world%20able%20to%20perform%20medical%20imaging%20to%20evaluate%20animals%20in%20BSL%2D4%20containment"&gt;Integrated Research Facility&lt;/a&gt; operates under the umbrella of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). It hosts one of the dozen research laboratories in North America allowed to handle germs that meet the criteria for Biosafety Level 4, the highest level of containment; it’s also one of the few places in the entire world where scientists can perform medical imaging on BSL-4 infected animals. BSL-4 pathogens typically cause severe or fatal illness, may be able to spread easily in a lab setting, and have few or no available treatments or vaccines. These pathogens include the viruses that cause Ebola and Lassa, as well as the reconstructed flu virus that caused the 1918 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Wired viewed an email sent by Michael Holbrook, associate director for high containment at the Integrated Research Facility, that detailed the facility’s shuttering. Holbrook reportedly told employees that the facility will be explicitly ending its studies on Lassa fever, SARS-Cov-2, and Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-rare-deadly-mosquito-virus-has-emerged-in-new-york-2000503317"&gt;rare but often deadly mosquitoborne virus&lt;/a&gt; found in the U.S. Northeast. The animals used for these studies, however, will not be euthanized. He added that officials from the Department of Homeland Security would padlock the freezers used for BSL-4 research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The sacrifice to research is immense,” Gigi Kwik Gronvall, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Wired. “If things are unused for a period of time, it will cost more money to get them ready to be used again.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The HHS’s closing of the Integrated Research Facility shouldn’t come as a complete surprise. After President Donald Trump’s election win last November, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who has since become HHS chief—promised that he would try to &lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2024/11/15/trump-pick-rfk-jr-promises-to-end-infectious-disease-research-on-week-one-video.html"&gt;shut down infectious disease research&lt;/a&gt; at the National Institutes of Health as soon as Trump took office. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy also &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-says-government-ignores-chronic-disease-misguided-rcna190042"&gt;(wrongly) claimed&lt;/a&gt; that federal funding on infectious diseases far outweighed the money spent studying chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;When contacted by Wired, a NIH spokesperson characterized the facility’s closing as a “research pause” and appeared to blame staff members for the shutdown, though without any further details. Notably, the facility’s director, Connie Schmaljohn, was also put on administrative leave.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This decision follows identification and documentation of personnel issues involving contract staff that compromised the facility’s safety culture, prompting this research pause,” Bradley Moss, communication director for the office of research services at NIH, told Wired.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The government’s stated rationale for pausing work at the Integrated Research Facility might merit some skepticism, however, given how unorganized and destructive the supposed “restructuring” of HHS being carried out by RFK Jr. has gone to date. And seeing as we’re still fresh off the worst pandemic seen in over a century, any sustained pause in infectious disease research is likely to be bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

It’s unclear how the announcement will affect availability of Covid vaccines that were expected to be updated for the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Kennedy also announced an effort Thursday for the National Institutes of Health to turbocharge the development of new inoculations for Covid, bird flu and seasonal flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The new vaccine development initiative would involve methods other than the mRNA technology used to develop the dominant Covid vaccines that are already in use, a statement from the Health and Human Services department said. The mRNA shots have been the subject of conspiracy theories, and Mr. Kennedy has intensely criticized them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Taken together, the moves suggest that Mr. Kennedy will reach far into the details of vaccine development, an effort likely informed by his decades as one of the nation’s most vocal critics of immunization oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

To require a placebo group would deny those patients access to the vaccine that has already been found safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SMND7JTT5RHDXOPUTWBGRZ7NWA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Claiming vaccines have risks the data doesn’t show or trying to overstate vaccine risks is not transparency,” said Dorit Reiss, a professor at the University of California College of the Law at San Francisco who tracks public health vaccine law. “It’s misinformation, and it undermines real transparency and informed consent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KXIWMZDR5ZEUVHSKQZPBYEIXLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Additionally, many vaccines have been tested against placebos, the experts said. And while HHS said the trials would be for “new vaccines,” if Kennedy tries to test vaccines that have already been approved, such as the measles vaccine, against a placebo, that would mean in practice some children would not get vaccinated against the infectious disease while their neighbors did — a quandary that physicians say leaves them susceptible to diseases when there is a vaccine that works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C5M36GTHZNBPZMSIJA3PFGT32Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Stanley Plotkin, a pioneer in the field who developed the rubella vaccine, said that when scientists test vaccines against a new disease, they typically look for evidence that the vaccinated individuals do not get a disease, compared with those who received a placebo. This is how the coronavirus vaccines were tested, in 30,000-person trials in which half of the participants received saline shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K6DDLGDNN5EFJP32D7DBKFU63I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But when a disease is already well understood, scientists can look for evidence that vaccines induce a biological response that has been scientifically shown to protect against the disease — what scientists call “a correlate of protection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RN77H467VZETRGSI5GBTAN7MII" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the case of diseases that cause serious illness and can even be fatal, if there are existing interventions, the use of placebos is often not considered ethical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="45JUNSUM5VDX7AFUE4X225PHCE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Ethics must be taken into account when you set up a study,” Plotkin said. “Can I ethically agree to having people acquire the disease because they receive a placebo?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="API2WOOX5BERHI6B3Z65RNLP44" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="API2WOOX5BERHI6B3Z65RNLP44" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Coronavirus vaccine in play?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YC5YSNXK4RBJZIOJM242X6KVFQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The administration has taken aim at reexamining the coronavirus vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AYNJD2OOKJECJCIE5LRIYT4JNY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When asked by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0lzUuxmH4w"&gt;CBS News on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; whether the Food and Drug Administration plans to green-light updates to the coronavirus shots, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency was “taking a look.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2QKKP4VXPNELBALY3WTUOOZCMQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We have a bit of a public trust problem,” Makary said. “I think there’s a void of data.

The company’s shot has been available under emergency use authorization and is the only vaccine that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/07/13/novavax-coronavirus-vaccine-fda-authorizes/"&gt;uses a more traditional protein base&lt;/a&gt; instead of messenger RNA — an appealing option to some who have reactions to mRNA shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5BZJEKNYN5EYVJPIRVRE3A232I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The FDA was on track to grant full approval to the vaccine April 1, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal deliberations. Top Trump FDA officials told agency regulators to pause the approval, these sources said — which some vaccine experts say amounts to political interference into decisions typically made by career staff tasked with reviewing the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="25KKAGDVKD3JX9EMX8DDNG0NF8" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“To be clear, this is a new product that Novavax is trying to introduce to the market with a study of a different product from 2021. New products require new clinical studies,” Makary wrote Saturday &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrMakaryFDA/status/1916253910039429309"&gt;in a post on X.&lt;/a&gt; Several vaccine experts dismiss the notion that the vaccine constitutes a new product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IA32VGHOIFHHBO3BQA6J7GLEW4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Such a move would be costly and suggests a potential shift in how the agency may approach coronavirus vaccines going forward. Typically, Pfizer and Moderna get instructions from the FDA on how to update their vaccines in June. It’s unclear whether they will need to run new clinical trials for their vaccines, which would be unlikely to occur before the annual coronavirus shot in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U2UKR6DSAVA2NHAY2IS6TAH6JY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“While we cannot comment on this specifically, we look forward to continued collaboration with the Administration and teams across HHS,” said Chris Ridley, a spokesman for Moderna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KX43SDV77FBF7FYSICJWRW2AFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Medical experts The Post spoke to predicted that the change by Kennedy could limit new vaccines approved under his watch, as well as slow investment by pharmaceutical companies.

			&lt;p&gt;There's a lot going on in the teeming &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-people-in-your-life-are-sharing-their-gut-microbes-with-you"&gt;microbiomes of our guts&lt;/a&gt;, and we're regularly making new discoveries about these bustling miniature ecosystems – including a new study identifying a symbiotic fungus that could fight liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fungus in question is &lt;i&gt;Fusarium foetens&lt;/i&gt;, and researchers led by a team from Peking University in China found that in mouse models, it was effective in stopping a fatty liver disease known as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22988-nonalcoholic-steatohepatitis"&gt;metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis&lt;/a&gt; or MASH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More precisely, it was the compound FF-C1 produced by &lt;i&gt;F. foetens&lt;/i&gt; that made the difference. Mice with a MASH-like disease treated with the fungus showed significant improvements in liver health, including lower inflammation levels and less scarring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_159629" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159629" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/EnzymeAnalysis.jpg" alt="Enzyme analysis" class="wp-image-159629 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/EnzymeAnalysis.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/EnzymeAnalysis-335x415.jpg 335w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/EnzymeAnalysis-600x744.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-159629" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The team studied the chemical reactions triggered by the fungus in mice. (Zhou et al., &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Several observations have shown that bacteria and fungi interact in the gut, where they influence each other through varying degrees of symbiosis," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adp5540"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our model is that elevation of &lt;i&gt;F. foetens&lt;/i&gt; in the gut leads to the generation of FF-C1, which enters the intestinal epithelia by an unclear mechanism."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having collected stool samples from 100 people across different parts of China, the team used a newly developed method for isolating and growing the different species of fungus potentially present in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-contain-a-variety-of-microbiomes-heres-a-look-at-a-few-of-the-most-important"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt; of these volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gave the researchers 161 different species of fungi. The ubiquity of &lt;i&gt;F. foetens&lt;/i&gt; in the samples, and its ability to adapt to low-oxygen environments, made it a prime candidate for further experiments in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as identifying the benefits for liver health, the study also outlined part of the way the fungus appears to be working: it seems the FF-C1 chemical dampens the activity of an enzyme called Ceramide Synthase 6 (CerS6), which lives in the lining of the gut and helps produce &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramide"&gt;fats in the blood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less CerS6 means it's less likely that MASH will get started or progress. The researchers backed up their hypothesis by genetically engineering mice to develop without any CerS6, or with too much of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We validated the role of CerS6 in &lt;i&gt;F. foetens&lt;/i&gt;–mediated amelioration of MASH in mice by intestinal-specific Cers6 deletion and overexpression," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adp5540"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results still need to be repeated in human trials of course, but further down the line, its possible these findings will inspire new treatments. Almost &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41575-023-00846-4"&gt;1 in 3 people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide have metabolic dysfunction–associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), a group of conditions that includes MASH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given how busy our guts are in terms of bacteria and fungi, it's likely that many more similar discoveries are waiting to be made – whether that's microbes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/toxin-secreting-yeast-may-be-behind-some-forms-of-gut-inflammation"&gt;that are causing disease&lt;/a&gt;, or protecting us from them. The same techniques used here could be deployed to identify more helpful fungi in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Optimizing culture techniques and medium composition for gut fungi is essential for understanding intestinal microecology and will yield deeper insights into host-gut microbiota cross-talk," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adp5540"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adp5540"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm feeling better than I've been feeling in months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Katie Drummond:&lt;/strong&gt; Wow!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren Goode:&lt;/strong&gt; Somehow, some way. I'm not on the road. I think maybe that's why, I've had a long bout without travel. Katie, I thought you were going to say that after you came back from France and you developed this new French butter habit that you were feeling better than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Katie Drummond:&lt;/strong&gt; I do. The butter is so life-affirming. I've been eating a lot of French butter. And I feel great! I feel incredible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauren Goode:&lt;/strong&gt; Amazing.

Here at WIRED, we've been reporting on the current administration's dismantling of the public health agencies and defunding of research programs. We've tracked all the ways that Elon Musk and his DOGE cohort have been hoovering up all of our sensitive health data and the sensitive health data of millions of Americans without offering a clear explanation of why they're doing it. And we've been watching the shift in culture around vaccines in America, and changing attitudes about what the government's role should be in our collective well-being. On this episode, we're going to talk about all of that. We'll talk about the measles outbreak. We'll talk about all of the other health crises that we really thought we would never have to talk about anymore. But it won't be all heavy stuff, I'm sure we will find a way at some point to have some fun in this show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 18:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQUDJOclpMTGlKejF4cHI0QjBRN29aOGkwX0ZBb19tTjJ2a2N4R2NqZnhESUx2NURiUEhZd25aNG1DVGN1ZUkwRFZOUnJuQ1N4RkNRdDdhX0d3NnFQajVsODk1NlhvLVAzZEFSTVdEQTM1cHdXWWFRQ1hfVGNBZW5TSTJNUzJVcy1DY1RNRVNxS3JTOG4tVXc</guid></item><item><title>全球分析发现，男性更容易生病，不太可能寻求三种常见疾病的治疗- Medical Xpress | Males are more likely to get sick and less likely to seek care for three common diseases, global analysis finds - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxNZ0lzTXVWNjNzUTRvYk5vbC1udm01dmlnNWc5dXQ1ZGVHNmptZTRuQjVIb1FLNFdabWt2MEl1cWNraFVQc2lnN0NOdXQwRVA4TWxxTWMyQm90dE9pd0xreVpmd3dJWWlDbHBHR1lxTFR4ZzRIc2hLRWtYZjE4NWkzM1JPTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many countries, males are more likely than females to get sick and die from three common conditions, and less likely to get medical care, according to a new study by Angela Chang of the University of Southern Denmark, and colleagues, published in the open-access journal &lt;a href="https://plos.io/44cqSV9" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+policies/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health policies&lt;/a&gt; are the same for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/males/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;males&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/females/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;females&lt;/a&gt;, even though there is strong evidence that sex and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gender/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; can substantially influence a person's health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers gathered global health data for people of different sexes and ages for three conditions: hypertension, diabetes, and HIV and AIDS. By comparing rates of diseases between males and females and differences in diagnosis and treatment, the researchers sought to illuminate and reduce health inequities between the sexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis identified significant differences between the sexes at each step in the "health pathway," which includes exposure to a risk factor, development of the condition, diagnosis, treatment and death. Males and females received different care for hypertension, diabetes and HIV and AIDS in 200, 39, and 76 countries, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Males had higher rates of disease and higher rates of death compared to females, and, in some countries, were less likely to seek out health care and adhere to treatment. In most countries, males were also more likely to smoke, while females were more likely to be obese and engage in unsafe sex.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Overall, the study suggests that public health professionals need to develop strategies to encourage males to participate in preventive and health care services. The researchers also highlight the importance of examining health data by sex to understand health inequities and guide appropriate interventions at multiple points along the health pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They conclude that we need more comprehensive datasets for these and other conditions so that we can monitor for sex differences and implement equitable health care policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professors Kent Buse and Sarah Hawkes, co-founders and co-CEOs of Global 50/50 say, "We have long advocated the benefits of publishing sex disaggregated data. As our Gendered Health Pathways demonstrate, such data can reveal where the health journeys of men and women diverge, be it in relation to the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/risk+factors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt; they are exposed to, their health care-seeking behaviors or their experiences in health care systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That is an important first step towards health equity. Most of these differences are not explained by sex (biology) alone, but by socially-constructed gender—highlighting the importance of taking a gender justice approach to reducing health inequities. A gender analysis can help to shape systems of health for all."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angela Chang, senior author, adds, "The evidence is clear: sex differences persist at nearly every point along the health pathway, from higher smoking rates in men to higher obesity prevalence in women, yet interventions rarely reflect this. Without sex-disaggregated cascade data, we're flying blind—unable to detect who is falling through the cracks in prevention, diagnosis, and care."&lt;/p&gt;

Adobe stock/HealthDay&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subtle facial gestures linked to the body's fight-or-flight response could be used to help diagnose people with &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/health-news/health-technology/new-hope-for-ringing-in-the-ears-729852.html" target="_blank"&gt;tinnitus&lt;/a&gt;, a new study says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video recordings showed that people with tinnitus experienced facial twitches and pupil dilation in response to certain sounds, researchers reported April 30 in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adp1934" target="_blank"&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time researchers have found a marker that could be used to identify tinnitus in people suffering from the hearing problem, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Imagine if cancer severity were determined by giving patients a questionnaire - this is the state of affairs for some common neurological disorders like tinnitus," senior investigator &lt;a href="https://researchers.masseyeandear.org/details/336" target="_blank"&gt;Daniel Polley&lt;/a&gt;, director of Mass Eye and Ear's Lauer Tinnitus Research Center in Boston, said in a news release.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we directly observed a signature of tinnitus severity," Polley said. "When we began this study, we didn't know if sounds would elicit facial movements; so, to discover that these movements not only occur, but can provide the most informative measure to date of tinnitus distress, is quite surprising."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus is the medical term for ringing in the ears, but it also can present as other persistent phantom sounds like buzzing or clicking, researchers said in background notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus affects about 12% of people, including 25% of seniors 65 and older. Most learn to live with the nuisance, but about 15% of people have tinnitus so severe that it disrupts their sleep, mental health and everyday function, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers hypothesized that people with debilitating tinnitus might exist in constant fight-or-flight mode, reacting to everyday sounds as though they were threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team recruited 47 folks with varying levels of tinnitus and compared them to 50 healthy people who served as a control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people were videotaped as they listened to pleasant, neutral or distressing sounds. The unpleasant sounds included coughing fits, yelling or a baby crying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using artificial intelligence (AI) software, they looked for rapid and subtle involuntary facial movements, like twitches in the cheeks, eyebrows or nostrils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that these twitches correlated with the levels of distress that participants had reported from tinnitus in questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the pupils of people with severe tinnitus dilated extra wide at all sounds, be they pleasant or unpleasant, researchers report. The pupils of people without tinnitus or with less bothersome tinnitus only responded to the most unpleasant sounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining the facial twitches with pupil dilation, researchers found they could accurately identify people most tormented by tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What's really exciting is this vantage point into tinnitus severity didn't require highly specialized brain scanners; instead, the approach was relatively low-tech," Polley said. "If we can adapt this approach to consumer-grade electronics, they could be put to use in hearing health clinics, as objective measures in clinical trials and by the public at large."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now using this test to develop ways to eliminate or significantly reduce the loudness of the phantom sounds from tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These biomarkers get to the root of the distress," said Polley. "While imaging might show hyperactive brain regions in tinnitus patients, these biomarkers reveal body-wide threat evaluation systems that are operating outside of their normal range, leading to the distressful symptoms they experience."&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;IRVING PARK — A confirmed measles case has been found in a Chicago resident, and another was found in a suburban Cook County resident, health officials announced Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the first two measles cases this year in Cook County, according to a news release from the city and county health departments. The agencies are coordinating to investigate, identify and notify people who might have been exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is relatively rare in the Chicago area; last year, an outbreak marked the &lt;a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/05/30/measles-outbreak-in-chicago-contained-city-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"&gt;first time Chicago had a confirmed measles case since 2019&lt;/a&gt;. That outbreak — with the majority of cases found among people staying at shelters for migrants — was contained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chicago is no stranger to measles after our outbreak last spring, and having contained it once, we know we can do it again,” Chicago health commissioner Dr. Olusimbo Ige said in the release. The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine “is an extremely effective tool for combatting illness and saving lives in our community. It’s never too late to get vaccinated and protect yourself from measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s first confirmed case was found in a Chicago adult who traveled internationally through O’Hare Airport in early April. They developed a rash April 25 and have been isolating at home since being diagnosed, according to the health departments. The adult had received one dose of the MMR vaccine; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, two doses are recommended for the best protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other case was found in a suburban Cook County adult whose vaccination status is unknown. The person went to a local hospital for medical care April 28 and was isolated after the illness was identified, according to the health departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who were at these locations April 21-28 might have been exposed, according to the agency:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;April 21 at Fittingly Delicious, 3939 W. Irving Park Road&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;10 a.m.-8 p.m. April 22 at O’Hare Airport, especially Terminal 1&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;10 a.m.-8 p.m. April 23 at O’Hare Airport, especially Terminal 1&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;10 a.m.-12:30 p.m. April 25 at Aldi, 7235 39th St. in Lyons&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;10 a.m.-12:30 p.m. April 27 at Shell, 3901 S. Harlem Ave. in Stickney &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;10:20 a.m.-1 p.m. April 28 at Mobil, 2945 S. Harlem Ave. in Berwyn&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials initially warned about an April 21 exposure at the Chicago Public Library Independence Branch, 4024 N. Elston Ave. But by Thursday, investigators determined the person with measles did not visit the location, and no additional action needs to be taken by people who visited the library that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles include rash, high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes, according to the health department. It can take seven to 21 days for symptoms to appear after a person is exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone presenting symptoms of measles should call their doctor or an emergency department before going there in person so staff can make arrangements to protect other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-to-know-about-measles"&gt;What To Know About Measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is rare in Chicago because there is a high vaccination rate in the city, but reports of cases have increased in the United States in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being fully immunized with the MMR vaccine is the most effective way to protect against being infected by and spreading the virus, Dr. Sameer Vohra, Illinois Department of Public Health director, said in the news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vaccine is widely available to people 1 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The MMR vaccine is safe and effective. We encourage anyone who is unvaccinated, or under-vaccinated, to speak with their medical provider and take appropriate steps to get up to date on the recommended shots,” Vohra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious and can be dangerous for unvaccinated people, particularly babies and young children, health department officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illness spreads easily through the air. When an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes, the virus can remain in a room for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complications from measles can lead to pneumonia, seizures, hearing loss, life-long brain damage and death, according to health department officials.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Misinformation has contributed to declining vaccination rates and fueled recent outbreaks” of measles, said Dr. Kiran Joshi, interim Cook County health department COO. “The MMR vaccine has been in use for over 50 years, is highly effective and has protected millions of lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-primary-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-primary-background-color has-background is-style-wide"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to the Block Club Chicago podcast:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his recent Netflix documentary, Don't Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever, tech millionaire Bryan Johnson reveals that he includes NAD precursors in his expansive supplement routine, totaling more than 50 pills a day.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;There's a good reason for that—NAD is an essential molecule that cells use to generate energy and many other vital cellular processes. Levels in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/skeletal+muscle/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;skeletal muscle&lt;/a&gt; decline by up to 30% with age, which has led to speculation that NAD supplementation can support health and counteract aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New research from the Treebak Group from the NNF Center for Basic Metabolic Research at the University of Copenhagen suggests that it may be a waste of money. In a study &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1550413125002128" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/i&gt;, scientists found that reducing skeletal muscle NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels in mice by 85% did not accelerate aging or impair whole-body metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results suggest that skeletal muscle can tolerate substantial NAD depletion without loss of function or accelerated aging," says Associate Professor Jonas Treebak, corresponding author of the study. "This challenges the prevailing view that NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decline is a primary driver of muscle aging and frailty."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAD helps mitochondria in cells produce energy in the form of ATP. However, scientists do not fully understand the extent to which the decline in NAD affects mitochondrial function and aging in general. For example, how low can NAD levels drop before an effect can be noticed?&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Healthy skeletal muscle function not reliant on high NAD levels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To study these questions, the scientists created a special type of mouse whose NAD levels could be reduced specifically in skeletal muscle after they became adults. This allowed the scientists to test the effect on mature muscle, avoiding any confusion with how NAD might affect muscle as it develops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though these mice had much lower NAD in their muscles, their muscle size, overall health, strength and exercise performance were all normal. Detailed studies of the cell's genes, proteins, mitochondria and DNA markers, called DNA methylation, remained normal despite the low NAD levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the mice with low muscle NAD did show increased energetic stress during exercise and some minor changes in how they processed energy, the overall markers of their whole-body and muscle health stayed the same as regular mice, even after they lived their entire lives with low muscle NAD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Contrary to what might have been expected, healthy skeletal muscle function is not as reliant on high levels of NAD as previously thought. Importantly, our findings indicate that reducing muscle NAD levels well beyond the modest drops seen with normal aging does not cause &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/muscle+weakness/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;muscle weakness&lt;/a&gt; or make the muscle age faster," says Sabina Chubanava, who carried out the research as a Ph.D. student and Postdoc in the Treebak Group.&lt;/p&gt;

In the beginning, she didn’t take the sport too seriously. “I went to practice, but I usually ran whatever was the shortest option available,” she recalls. Back then, she says, running was a “good, healthy” part of her life. But after a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/how-to-break-up-with-someone.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;difficult breakup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; in her senior year of high school, her approach changed. She started using exercise as a way to cope with emotional pain and soon became competitive about her race times. &lt;/em&gt;“&lt;em&gt;I was probably doing a three- or four-mile run five days a week,” she says. Around the same time, a friend announced she was giving up &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/05/new-nutrition-labels-will-call-out-percentage-of-added-sugar.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;processed sugar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and Kelly remembers saying, “Oh, cool, I’ll do that with you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma467qql000v3b6dmz0o9u2b@published" data-word-count="72"&gt;&lt;em&gt;That dietary change “flipped a switch,” says Kelly, who is now a brand-strategy consultant on the West Coast. “It triggered more restrictions.” Up until then, Kelly had eaten fairly intuitively. She had never felt critical of her body. But giving up sugar made her newly health-conscious. “I ate like somebody who needed to lose weight, but I should have been eating like somebody who was fueling for performance and energy,” she says. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma467qqc000u3b6dadqojpxi@published" data-word-count="59"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly had been having regular &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/menstruation-full-moon-red-moon-cycle-white-moon-cycle.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;periods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; since she was 13, but when she was 18 and made these lifestyle changes, her period stopped. “I was told by coaches and doctors, ‘Oh, that is just something that happens to active women,’” she says. Years later, when she started thinking about starting a family, the severity of her condition became clear. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma460vu600160iggp0pc0y08@published" data-word-count="43"&gt;During my freshman year of college, my parents sat me down for a talk. They were worried that I was exercising too much and had grown too thin. They said, “Will you just go to a doctor and have them run some labs?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma4689uk00173b6df183hg4s@published" data-word-count="61"&gt;So I went to a primary-care doctor and they ran a bunch of labs and they said that everything was normal. My BMI was right at the bottom of the healthy range. And so I said to my parents, “Look, see, I’m fine.” I got even deeper into running at that point — running half-marathons and marathons and doing well in them.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma460vu600180iggue4vsyze@published" data-word-count="33"&gt;I ran in a recreational league in college, and though we didn’t compare notes, I definitely knew a handful of other women who also had lost their periods. That normalized it for me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma468nzd001h3b6dy3rys8nl@published" data-word-count="61"&gt;Plus, I was off and on birth-control pills, depending on if I was in a long-term relationship or not. When I was on the pill, it let me push the questions surrounding my period to the back of my mind, because when you’re on the pill, it masks your natural period. I bled no matter what, because of the synthetic hormones.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma460vu6001a0iggdysm2bwe@published" data-word-count="81"&gt;When I was a sophomore, I started getting a bit suspicious. I had this nagging feeling of, &lt;em&gt;Maybe this isn’t healthy; maybe I should go off the pill and see if I get my period naturally.&lt;/em&gt; I went off the pill and, sure enough, I didn’t get my period. I made an appointment with my gynecologist and said, “I’m a runner. I’m not getting my period. It’s been like this for a long time. Is this bad? What should I do?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma469355001q3b6dqsylqr12@published" data-word-count="52"&gt;And the doctor said, “Look at you! You’re healthy. You love running. You’re not trying to have a baby right now. It’s fine. And when you want to have a baby, you can always come back. We can talk about IVF! But you’re nowhere near there, so I wouldn’t worry about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma469355001r3b6dbuoxcdau@published" data-word-count="82"&gt;I trusted him. He was the doctor who delivered me — this old, lovely guy. I also didn’t question what he said because I was afraid of gaining weight. If he had told me, “Look, this is unhealthy. This is not good. You need to stop this,” I would’ve listened. It would’ve been hard for me, but I would’ve listened to him. But the opposite of that happened. I thought, &lt;em&gt;Well, I was a little worried, but the doctor said it’s fine. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma469356001s3b6d8nd0q8eg@published" data-word-count="54"&gt;So I kept running. At my peak, I was running more than 70 miles a week and eating a little more than I had been in high school. After that doctor’s appointment, I didn’t think about my missing period for a long time. I went back on the pill and I graduated from college.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma469fcb00293b6dqz0jenaz@published" data-word-count="80"&gt;In my late 20s, I switched from the pill to a copper IUD without hormones, one that wouldn’t affect my menstrual cycle. I still didn’t get my period. At that point, I started to feel like I was in menopause. My hair was getting thin and falling out, and I had a huge crash in energy. I just felt weird and horrible and off. Without the pill, I began to feel in my body what it meant not to menstruate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma469l6o002i3b6duy9csgr7@published" data-word-count="33"&gt;By then, I had also fallen in love, and though I wasn’t ready for kids, I could imagine having them fairly soon. That’s when I finally admitted to myself, “This is probably bad.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma469ugq002z3b6dld25u1x2@published" data-word-count="94"&gt;The physician ordered an MRI to see if I had a pituitary tumor — that came back negative. They also conducted a Provera challenge, in which the patient is given a course of synthetic progesterone to see if it will induce menstruation. I failed it. But I still didn’t get any kind of diagnosis. Instead, they told me, “Oh, you have this thing that happens to active women,” and said, “It’s possible that eating a little more could help. You could try cutting back your running a bit and increasing your calories a bit.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46a71j003h3b6d3jj4xfbs@published" data-word-count="42"&gt;Right about then, a book came out called &lt;a href="https://www.noperiodnowwhat.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Period, Now What?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;It was written by Nicola Sykes, who has a Ph.D. in computational biology. She went through this experience herself and realized that there should be better information about it available.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46acut003q3b6d4awaz4vq@published" data-word-count="62"&gt;Reading the book, a lightbulb went off. I had a textbook case of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24431-hypothalamic-amenorrhea"&gt;hypothalamic amenorrhea&lt;/a&gt; (HA) — when the hypothalamus causes your period to stop. That can happen due to low energy availability, excessive exercise, or chronic stress. HA can cause short-term issues like fatigue and mood swings and lead to bigger problems down the road, like bone loss, heart risks, and infertility.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46acut003r3b6d9teuzeup@published" data-word-count="45"&gt;In the book, Sykes wrote that to recover from this, you need to stop &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;intense exercise — anything that gets your heart rate up — and consume at least 2,500 calories a day. If you do those things, then your period will come back.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46ampk00483b6d7ag8qiwp@published" data-word-count="61"&gt;I read the book and my first reaction was like, “I know this is me, but oh my God, you have to stop doing &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; intense exercise? I’m a runner! This gives me so much joy. I’m in all these groups of friends that are runners!” I couldn’t imagine doing that. So I decided, &lt;em&gt;I’ll eat more and I’ll exercise less&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46at9p004h3b6dgpqtygt7@published" data-word-count="129"&gt;I switched to a high-calorie diet with no restrictions whatsoever — I ate lots of pizza, ice cream, pasta. I prioritized high-carb foods and frequent meals throughout the day. Eating more was easier for me to wrap my head around than not exercising. So for a few months, I didn’t change much about my running. But still, no period. So then I ran a little bit less, and a little less and less and less — and I still didn’t get my period. Finally, after about six months of this, another lightbulb went off and I realized,&lt;em&gt; This gradual method is just going to prolong how long it takes me to recover. If I want to get back to running a lot, I have to stop completely for now. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46at9q004i3b6dsfzlx12n@published" data-word-count="66"&gt;So I stopped all exercise. I biked to work — an easy bike ride — and that was it. At first, not running was the hardest thing I’d ever done. It was excruciating. I just felt so antsy all the time, and I really, really wanted to run. If I saw somebody jogging in the street, I’d feel so jealous and sad and conflicted and bad.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46at9q004j3b6dhsaxv39t@published" data-word-count="121"&gt;But then I woke up a week or two into those six weeks and I was like, &lt;em&gt;Oh, wow, I don’t care if I run today or not. I’ll do this as long as it takes.&lt;/em&gt; I soon noticed that life had a lot more ups and downs, and that was a surprise. Sometimes I felt good, and sometimes I felt bad. I realized that for the past decade, it was as if I had been putting a blanket over everything, because running was very effective at making me feel even-keeled. If I did ten miles in the morning, I’d have all these endorphins, and the rest of the day, nothing much bothered. But the thing is, things should bother you.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46b3pe00503b6dpyehrfdm@published" data-word-count="84"&gt;My period came back six weeks after I fully stopped running. I remember discovering that I had my period and thinking, &lt;em&gt;Oh my God, this is amazing. This is beautiful. &lt;/em&gt;It had been ten years since I’d had one. I was so angry that none of the doctors said to me, “Hey, this is a thing that happens to people and we know how to recover from it. This is what you have to do.” Instead, I treated myself after reading a random book.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46bg3p005i3b6dsbb7bife@published" data-word-count="83"&gt;I gained weight during this time, about maybe 10 or 12 pounds — I’m four-foot-ten, so that’s a lot on me. I had to buy new clothes. It was a little difficult, mentally, because I was used to being extremely thin. I was about to get married and I remember when I went to my last dress fitting, they said, “Oh, actually, you’re not as skinny as you were when we first fit this, so we have to take it out a little.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46blg0005r3b6dia1fvv47@published" data-word-count="57"&gt;At first, that made me uncomfortable, but I was so sold on the idea that I was doing the right thing. I knew it was healthy, and I experienced a major shift in my mind-set. I just thought, &lt;em&gt;Yeah, it’s working! They &lt;/em&gt;should &lt;em&gt;take my dress out because I shouldn’t have been the size I was before. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46c0e900683b6davkmv04v@published" data-word-count="70"&gt;After about a year, we decided to try for a baby. I was back to running, but not super competitively at all — I was interested in other things now. I was probably doing around 30 miles per week. I had already been tracking my cycle very closely, because when you have had HA, you’re more prone to losing your period again. So I knew exactly when I was ovulating.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46c7ge006h3b6dm0r9cxum@published" data-word-count="159"&gt;It took me three cycles to get pregnant, and then I miscarried. But that miscarriage was not a heartbreaking experience for me. One day, I thought I got my period, and then my period just didn’t stop. Normally, my periods are maybe four or five days long, and I was on day nine and I was still bleeding, and I thought, &lt;em&gt;What is going on?&lt;/em&gt; I went to my OB/GYN — a new one — and she asked me if I’d taken a pregnancy test. And I said, “No, you don’t understand, I am on day ten of my cycle. I haven’t even ovulated yet.” I was kind of frustrated with her. My experience over the past decade had destroyed my trust in doctors and made me feel like if I wanted good care, I needed to be the one to make sure it happened — I couldn’t blindly trust doctors to be doing the right thing for me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46c7gf006i3b6dm06xu3dj@published" data-word-count="51"&gt;She said, “Okay, that makes sense, that’s fine, but why don’t we just rule it out?” So I went to the bathroom, took the pregnancy test, and it was positive, and I was like, “Oh my God, I’m not on day ten of my cycle. I’m still on the previous cycle!”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46c7gf006j3b6dx6f9loz4@published" data-word-count="55"&gt;We found out it was a nonviable pregnancy, and I had to have a D&amp;amp;C — I think because they were worried it might be ectopic. But because I had never gotten excited over a positive pregnancy test, I just thought, &lt;em&gt;Wow, how cool I can get pregnant! &lt;/em&gt;I didn’t feel too sad at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46c7gf006k3b6drxohim3v@published" data-word-count="18"&gt;Three cycles later, I was pregnant again. And this time, the pregnancy went great. I loved being pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46cgrb00713b6dsbhs5jt4@published" data-word-count="35"&gt;The birth was complicated and bad. My baby was born with the cord wrapped around his neck and he was totally blue: low Apgar score. He had to be in the NICU for a week.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46coq1007a3b6d9pubt7k1@published" data-word-count="65"&gt;They discharged me, and then I came back to the hospital the very next day to be with him in the NICU. I had a friend who was an OB at the hospital. When she came to say hi and see how I was doing, I said, “I feel okay for having just given birth! But I do feel like I’m a little bit swollen.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46coq1007b3b6dnq1q9nrv@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;In fact, I had mentioned to the nurses before I was discharged that I felt like I looked very, very swollen. My hands, my face, my legs, my ankles. I felt uncomfortable, and I didn’t look like myself. But the nurse kind of laughed at me and said, “No, no, I’m more swollen than you! You’re not that swollen. This is what happens postpartum!”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46coq1007c3b6dsoil4y1a@published" data-word-count="37"&gt;I thought, &lt;em&gt;Okay, that’s fine.&lt;/em&gt; But then my OB friend said, “Sure, that can be normal, but since you’re here at the hospital, why don’t you just get your blood pressure taken and make sure everything’s okay?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46coq1007d3b6dl5jvxq39@published" data-word-count="56"&gt;So I walked around the corner to labor and delivery, and I said, “I feel kind of swollen. I just gave birth. Can you guys take my blood pressure?” They were a bit dismissive, and they said, “You don’t look that swollen, and we’re super busy right now. Can you come back in a few hours?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46coq2007e3b6dt6kkpf13@published" data-word-count="71"&gt;When my friend came back to check on me and I told her what happened, she said, “You know what? I’m just going to take your blood pressure myself.” She took my blood pressure, and all these alarms went off. It was like 200 over 100 or something crazy. They checked me in immediately — I had postpartum preeclampsia, and I had to be inpatient for a week. That was horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46coq2007f3b6d9dmrb0kj@published" data-word-count="76"&gt;A lot of people don’t realize that you can get preeclampsia up to six weeks postpartum. It’s even more deadly postpartum because doctors are less likely to catch it. So I was very lucky that I was in the hospital visiting my son in the NICU and that my friend was there. As far as I know, this had nothing to do with my history of HA — preeclampsia is just a thing that can happen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46coq2007g3b6dm63r2mei@published" data-word-count="28"&gt;My son was actually discharged one day earlier than me, so my last night in the hospital was our first night with him in the room with us.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46czjh007x3b6dwiqfsyfz@published" data-word-count="84"&gt;I feel so grateful that I found a way to recover from HA before I became a parent. I’ve heard stories of women with HA who, instead of recovering, do IVF to get pregnant. It’s scary to think that I could have gone through pregnancy in the compromised health state that HA puts you in. And it’s even more scary to think that I could have become a mother in the compromised emotional state that led me to develop HA in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46d63200863b6dphgrm75z@published" data-word-count="57"&gt;I was very rigid about food and exercise. Becoming a parent, especially in the early days, forces you to put someone else’s needs before your own and give up control. This is a stressful shift even for people who are mentally fit. I can’t imagine doing it from the mind-set I was in when I had HA.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46d63200873b6d7wdu83un@published" data-word-count="72"&gt;I have two sons now — they are 6 and 4. With both boys, when I was postpartum, I felt myself itching to fall back into my old eating and exercising patterns. I was burning tons and tons of calories through breastfeeding, and I think as a result, I just felt this intense desire to run a lot and not eat enough in a way that was weird and surprising to me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46d63200883b6d61i1rxt1@published" data-word-count="88"&gt;But as soon as I would follow through on these urges a little bit — like, say, &lt;em&gt;Oh, I’m going to go on a long run, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Oh, I’m not going to have a snack &lt;/em&gt;— suddenly I was like, &lt;em&gt;Wow, that’s interesting. I notice that this behavior pattern in my brain is definitely not what I want, so I’ll stop that. &lt;/em&gt;I could feel it starting, but I knew there was no way, with everything that I’ve been through, that I’d let it progress to its end.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46d63300893b6d2nl9ql60@published" data-word-count="83"&gt;As I’ve gotten older, I see that when I was younger, I thought, &lt;em&gt;Running is my thing!&lt;/em&gt; I still love running, and I can’t imagine life without it. But now that I have two kids and my career, there have been times when I’m running more and times when I’m running less. I’m grateful that I was forced to recover from HA because it made running just one thing among many that I enjoy, and sometimes it takes a backseat, and that’s good.&lt;/p&gt;

Ask whether it’s really in the best interest of the patient.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Dr Johnson acknowledges that 'CT scans are a wonderful technology,' he adds that doctors 'may want to consider potential alternatives.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;CT scans are used to diagnose and monitor cancers and bone injuries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/new-cancer-risk-data-suggest-hitting-pause-routine-ct-scans-2025a10009xo?icd=login_success_email_match_fpf&amp;amp;icd=login_success_email_match_fpf"&gt;video &lt;/a&gt;for Medscape, Dr Johnson said: 'CT scans are a wonderful technology. There’s no doubt of that. However, we may want to consider potential alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We may also want to ask ourselves whether these scans are the best tools we have and ultimately whether they will change patient management.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CT scans, which use ionizing radiation to create detailed images of the body, are not the only imaging tool doctors have at their disposal. They are best used for imaging of bones, soft tissues and organs and are frequently used for detecting tumors, fractures and blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Johnson noted the FDA has recognized ionizing radiation as a carcinogen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr David Johnson is urging doctors to reevaluate if CT scans are really in their patients' best interests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are similar scans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An x-ray also uses radiation - though a lower dose - to produce images of the body, but those images are less detailed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While CT scans produce 3-dimensional images, x-rays only produce 2-dimensional images. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MRIs use no radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, the machines use magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of soft tissue and organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they are more expensive than CT scans (costing as much as $12,000 per scan) and take longer, which can prove fatal if images are needed right away in an emergency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While an MRI can take between 30 and 60 minutes, a CT scan only takes about 15 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Johnson first raised concerns about CT scans and cancer risk in a 2009 opinion &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrgastro.2009.184"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He wrote: 'Unfortunately, there is little cognizance among health-care providers (or their patients) about the relative latent cancer risks associated with repetitive exposure to ionizing radiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Given the exposure of a relatively high proportion of the population to these tests, it is incumbent on healthcare providers to have an improved understanding of these risks and discuss them accordingly with their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The risks and benefits of these tests should be carefully analyzed and radiation exposure risk assessment should be conducted as part of the selection of diagnostic and screening tests.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the estimated percent lifetime risk of death from cancer that is attributable to the radiation from a single CT scan of the head&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the estimated percent lifetime risk of death from cancer that is attributable to the radiation from a single CT scan of the abdomen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That same year, researchers estimated high doses of radiation from CT scans were responsible for two percent of all cancers (roughly 30,000) per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, recent &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778?resultClick=1"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;estimated 'CT-associated cancer could eventually account for five percent of all new cancer diagnoses annually.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, a study by California researchers estimated that, over the lifetime of the millions of people receiving CT scans, about 103,000 radiation-induced cancers from the scans are projected to result from tests done in 2023 alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Johnson said in the video that the findings 'were quite striking.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers warned CT machines emit unsafe levels of radiation that can fuel the formation of tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The highest number of projected cancer cases in adults was linked to CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, followed closely by chest CTs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Across all patients, the most frequently associated cancers were lung, colon, leukemia, and bladder cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among female patients specifically, breast cancer emerged as the second most common type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a professor at the University of California-San Francisco medical school, is one of the authors of the new research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In her new research, the team found the three most common cancers observed in exposed patients were lung cancer - 22,400 cases - colon cancer - 8,700 cases- and leukemia - 7,900 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the number of CT scans performed in millions (right axis and blue lines) and the incidence of cancer per 1,000 CT scans (left axis and black lines)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the projected number of CT-induced cancers by body region exposed to the scan in adults&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Estimated radiation-induced cancer risks were higher in children, despite adults receiving more CTs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Men and women experienced CT-related cancers at about the same rate across all ages and number of scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer risk related to CT exposure was highest in people in the 60s and lowest for children under 10 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Smith-Bindman previously told NBC: 'It’s unfathomable. We keep doing more and more CTs, and the doses keep going up.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said between two machines, one could be exposing patients to 10 to 15 times higher radiation doses than the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'There is very large variation and the doses vary by an order of magnitude — tenfold, not 10 percent different — for patients seen for the same clinical problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiation exposure is measured in millisieverts (mSv), which measures the amount of radiation absorbed by the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People are exposed to small amounts of radiation every day from their background environment or through things like flying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, a roundtrip flight between New York and Tokyo exposes a person to 0.19 mSv. An x-ray of the stomach emits 0.6 mSv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2009 study looked at the radiation dose associated with the 11 most common types of CT scans performed on 1,119 adult patients in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the projected number of CT-induced cancers by body region exposed to the scan in kids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiation exposure varied widely. Average doses ranged from 2 mSv for a head CT to 31 mSv for an abdominal and pelvic CT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers found the amount of radiation emitted by CT scanners varied widely across the four hospitals they collected data from - with a 13-fold difference between the highest and lowest doses for each scan type. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an attempt to tackle the problem, new Medicare regulations effective this year will require hospitals and imaging centers to collect and share information about the radiation emitted by their scanners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The regulations also require a more careful inspection of the dosing, quality and necessity of CT scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new rules, issued in the final weeks of the Biden administration, are being rolled out over three years in hospitals and outpatient clinics and providers could face fines if they do not comply, beginning in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Trump administration has not commented on its plans to follow, revise or reverse the new policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            Cases of whooping cough are climbing across the country this year, with about 6,600 already documented — nearly four times the number at the same point last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4dixt800003b6m2bigmlu0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2024, there were more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;35,000&lt;/a&gt; cases of whooping cough in the United States, the highest in more than a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html" target="_blank"&gt;decade&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Ten people died&lt;/a&gt;, including six babies less than 1 year old.

            Given the rise in cases, I wanted to know what causes whooping cough, how it spreads and what the symptoms are. What vaccine is recommended to prevent it, and who should get it? Why do cases appear to be surging? And what should people who are concerned about whooping cough do protect themselves and others?
    &lt;/p&gt;

            To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.

            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Whooping cough, also called pertussis, is a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;highly contagious respiratory illness&lt;/a&gt; caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. These bacteria are spread from person to person. If someone infected with pertussis coughs or sneezes, tiny droplets are released that contain the bacteria. People nearby can become infected by breathing in the droplets. The bacteria can also be spread through prolonged close contact when people share the same breathing space — for instance, when infected people &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/whooping-cough/symptoms-causes/syc-20378973" target="_blank"&gt;hold a baby&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/pertussis#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; generally start seven to 10 days following infection. Initially, an infected person develops symptoms similar to a cold and other mild respiratory infections, such as a low-grade fever, runny nose and cough. The cough often then progresses to a severe hacking cough that is characterized by &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;violent coughing fits&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e6086000t3b6m51au6b57@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During these coughing fits, people may make a high-pitched “whoop” when they try to take breaths after they cough, hence the name whooping cough. The fits may be so severe that they vomit during or afterward. Many struggle to sleep as a result. Some may have trouble breathing, and patients have been known to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/health/whooping-cough-cases-surging-human-challenge/index.html"&gt;break their ribs&lt;/a&gt; due to the severity of the force associated with coughing.

            Pertussis is especially dangerous in infants. Globally, it is a significant cause of disease and death in infancy, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/pertussis#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. About 1 in 3 babies younger than 1 year old infected with pertussis will need care in the hospital, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC statistics&lt;/a&gt; also indicate that about 1 in 5 of those hospitalized develop pneumonia, 1 in 50 have convulsions, and about 1 in 100 will die from their complications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In addition, there are people with preexisting health conditions that may be exacerbated by pertussis. These &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/postexposure-prophylaxis/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;include&lt;/a&gt; those who are immunocompromised or have moderate to severe asthma.

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Length of time to recover depends on the individual. Coughing fits typically last between &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;one and six weeks&lt;/a&gt;, but they can persist for as long as 10 weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The treatment for pertussis is antibiotics. There are a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/clinical-care/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;common antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; that are effective against pertussis, including azithromycin, clarithromycin and erythromycin. The earlier the treatment begins, the better the prognosis. Early treatment has been shown to reduce severity and the time to recover.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; In some patients, the diagnosis can be made simply by hearing the characteristic cough. Others who are a bit more subtle will &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/pertussis/symptoms-diagnosis" target="_blank"&gt;require testing&lt;/a&gt; via a nose and throat swab.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            People infected with pertussis can spread the bacteria from the time their symptoms start until at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;two weeks&lt;/a&gt; after coughing begins. Many cases of pertussis may be spread by people who think they have a run-of-the-mill virus before their severe coughing fits begin. Early use of antibiotics can shorten the time someone is contagious.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What vaccine is recommended to prevent it? At what ages should it be given?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e608600133b6mizgsh19u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; There are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;two types&lt;/a&gt; of combination vaccines that include protection against pertussis, the DTaP vaccine and Tdap. These vaccinations include protection against tetanus (the “T” in each name) and diphtheria (the “D” and “d” in those names).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e608600143b6mg85cjyry@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap-tdap-td/hcp/administering-vaccine.html" target="_blank"&gt;DTaP&lt;/a&gt; series is five doses of the vaccine given at 2 months, 4 months and 6 months old, then 15 months through 18 months old, then 4 years through 6 years old, according to the CDC’s recommended immunization schedule. Tdap is then recommended for all adolescents, with the preferred age of administration being 11 to 12 years old.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e608600153b6m2iowjobs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Adults who never received Tdap should receive a single dose. To maintain protection, all adults should also receive a booster &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/health/whooping-cough-cases-surging-human-challenge/index.html"&gt;every 10 years&lt;/a&gt;. And pregnant women are recommended one dose of Tdap during a pregnancy to be given during gestational weeks 27 through 36 to convey some antibodies to their baby. Getting the vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap-tdap-td/hcp/about-vaccine.html" target="_blank"&gt;reduces&lt;/a&gt; the likelihood of contracting pertussis as well as the severity of the disease if one were to get it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e608600163b6mi3wc09n3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Why are pertussis cases increasing?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The exact cause is not known, though there are some hypotheses. One is related to the Covid-19 pandemic: More people were wearing masks, isolating and taking precautions that reduced transmission of all respiratory illnesses. As a result, there were fewer pertussis cases then, with a rebound once these precautions stopped. Moreover, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7338a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; for DTaP along with other childhood immunizations have been declining. This is an unfortunate development. People should be reminded that during the early part of the 20th century, before widespread availability of the pertussis vaccine, pertussis was a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;major cause&lt;/a&gt; of childhood mortality in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Completing the DTaP series is important, as is receiving the Tdap vaccine for those who are eligible. Individuals with symptoms of pertussis should get tested so that they can know if they have pertussis and prevent spread to others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e5y6y000o3b6m5v12st0g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People should also know that the likelihood of spread within a household is high. In addition to good handwashing and the limiting of contact with infected people, the CDC recommends that everyone who shares a household with someone who has pertussis, even if they don’t have symptoms, should get antibiotics within 21 days of the beginning of the cough in that initial person.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e6zhq001c3b6mpu9hy9dc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This method of receiving antibiotics after exposure, known as post-exposure prophylaxis, can help reduce their chance of contracting pertussis. In addition, the CDC supports providing antibiotics to people at high risk of severe infection within 21 days of exposure to someone who has pertussis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cutting-edge weight-loss drug &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/general-health/ozempic-2665708850.html" target="_blank"&gt;Ozempic/Wegovy&lt;/a&gt; can stop and even reverse fatty liver disease, a new clinical trial has found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly twice as many people taking &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/semaglutide.html" target="_blank"&gt;semaglutide&lt;/a&gt; stopped their fatty liver disease without further scarring of the organ -- 63%, compared with 34% of those taking a placebo, researchers reported April 30 in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/" target="_blank"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An estimated 15 million Americans -- 1 in 20 adults-- suffer from fatty liver disease, also known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), researchers said in background notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results from the clinical trial "provide strong evidence that semaglutide can help patients with MASH by not only improving liver health, but also addressing the underlying metabolic issues that contribute to the disease," lead researcher &lt;a href="https://liverinstitute.medschool.vcu.edu/about/team/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Arun Sanyal&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Virginia Commonwealth University Stravitz-Sanyal Institute for Liver Disease and Metabolic Health, said in a news release.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MASH occurs when fat builds up in the liver, leading to inflammation and scarring. The condition has been linked to obesity, &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/diabetes/type-2-diabetes-644147.html" target="_blank"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, elevated cholesterol levels and &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/hypertension/high-blood-pressure-hypertension-645539.html" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Cleveland_Clinic/" target="_blank" title="Cleveland Clinic" class="tpstyle"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) drug. It works by mimicking the GLP-1 hormone, which helps control insulin and blood sugar levels, decreases appetite and slows digestion of food.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the clinical trial, researchers recruited 800 people in 37 countries with moderate to severe liver scarring from fatty liver disease and randomly assigned roughly two-thirds to take semaglutide for 72 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with a reduction in liver inflammation, about 37% of semaglutide users showed less liver scarring compared to about 23% in the placebo group, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, about a third of semaglutide users achieved both inflammation reduction and scarring improvement, more than double those taking placebo, results show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide also helped people lose weight, improve their liver function, and boost their overall heart health, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By treating both liver disease and its metabolic causes, semaglutide offers a promising new approach for millions of patients," Sanyal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is only one U.S. government-approved treatment available for fatty liver disease, &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/rezdiffra.html" target="_blank"&gt;Rezdiffra&lt;/a&gt; (resmetirom), researchers said. It works by activating a thyroid hormone receptor that promotes reduction of fat buildup in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer of semaglutide, Novo Nordisk, plans to seek U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Food_and_Drug_Administration/" target="_blank" title="Food and Drug Administration" class="tpstyle"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; (FDA) approval for the drug to treat fatty liver disease later this year, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cleveland Clinic has more on &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15831-fatty-liver-disease" target="_blank"&gt;fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt;.

			&lt;p&gt;If you've ever tried to build a new habit – whether that's exercising more, eating healthier, or going to bed earlier – you may have heard the popular claim that it only takes 21 days to form a habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a neat idea. Short, encouraging and full of promise. But there's just one problem: it's not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 21-day myth can be traced back to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671700758/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0671700758&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=jamesclear-20&amp;amp;linkId=6DQ32IRAG3LU4PKA"&gt;Maxwell Maltz&lt;/a&gt;, a plastic surgeon in the 1960s, who observed it took about three weeks for his patients to adjust to physical changes. This idea was later picked up and repeated in self-help books, eventually becoming accepted wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as psychologists and behavioural scientists have since discovered, habit formation is &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-long-does-it-really-take-to-form-a-habit/"&gt;much more complex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How long does it really take?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.674"&gt;2010 study&lt;/a&gt; followed volunteers trying to build simple routines – such as drinking water after breakfast or eating a daily piece of fruit – and found it took a median of 66 days for the behaviour to become automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/12/23/2488"&gt;reviewed several studies&lt;/a&gt; looking at how long it took people to form health-related habits. We found, on average, it took around two to five months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the studies that measured time to reach automaticity (when a behaviour becomes second nature) found that habit formation took between 59 and 154 days. Some people developed a habit in as few as four days. Others took nearly a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wide range highlights that habit formation isn't one-size-fits-all. It depends on what the behaviour is, how often it's repeated, how complex it is, and who's doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What determines whether a habit will stick?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habit strength plays a key role in consistency. A &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.626750/full"&gt;2021 systematic review&lt;/a&gt; focused on physical activity and found the stronger the habit (meaning the more automatic and less effortful the behaviour felt) the more likely people were to exercise regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not entirely surprising that easy, &lt;a href="https://bjgp.org/content/62/605/664"&gt;low-effort behaviours&lt;/a&gt; such as drinking water or taking a daily  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="159871" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; tend to form faster than complex ones like training for a marathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whatever the habit, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-024-00305-0"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; sticking to it is not just about boosting motivation or willpower. Interventions that actively support habit formation – through repetition, cues and structure – are much more effective for creating lasting change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, programs that encourage people to schedule regular exercise at the same time each day, or apps that send reminders to drink water after every meal, help build habits by making the behaviour easier to repeat and harder to forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_159875" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159875" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/drink-water-642x428.jpg" alt="Forming New Habits Can Take Longer Than You Think.

&lt;p&gt;But what stood out most was that even small, everyday actions can grow into powerful routines, when repeated consistently. It's not about overhauling your life overnight, but about steadily reinforcing behaviours until they become second nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8 tips for building lasting habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're looking to build a new habit, here are some science-backed tips to help them stick:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give it time. Aim for consistency over &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/12/23/2488"&gt;60 days&lt;/a&gt;. It's not about perfection – missing a day won't reset the clock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3505409/"&gt;Make it easy&lt;/a&gt;. Start small. Choose a behaviour you can realistically repeat daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attach your new habit &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/12/23/2488"&gt;to an existing routine&lt;/a&gt;. That is, make the new habit easier to remember by linking it to something you already do – such as flossing right before you brush your teeth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0144929X.2020.1801840"&gt;Track your progress&lt;/a&gt;. Use a calendar or app to tick off each successful day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212267215011181?casa_token=-VKsr03fXOUAAAAA:pKV0oAB5VVuj8RcPAW5T7prjo3efSVpi6P6TXFoeTLHBX_vFK0ttF6tFM9-8Fp6o45XPu_lcij5d"&gt;rewards&lt;/a&gt;, for example making a special  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="159871" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; after a morning walk or watching an episode of your favourite show after a week of consistent workouts. Positive emotions help habits stick, so celebrate small wins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Morning is best. Habits practised &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fhea0000510"&gt;in the morning&lt;/a&gt; tend to form more reliably than those attempted at night. This may be because people typically have more motivation and fewer distractions earlier in the day, making it easier to stick to new routines before daily demands build up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal choice boosts success. People are more likely to stick with habits &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00560/full"&gt;they choose themselves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.674"&gt;Repetition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in a stable context is key. Performing the same behaviour in the same situation (such as walking right after lunch each day) increases the chances it will become automatic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why the 21-day myth matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Believing habits form in 21 days sets many people up to fail. When change doesn't "click" within three weeks, it's easy to feel like you're doing something wrong. This can lead to frustration, guilt and giving up entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, understanding the real timeline can help you stay motivated when things feel slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence shows habit formation usually takes at least two months, and sometimes longer. But it also shows change is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/12/23/2488"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bjgp.org/content/62/605/664"&gt;other evidence&lt;/a&gt; confirm that repeated, intentional actions in stable contexts really do become automatic. Over time, new behaviours can feel effortless and deeply ingrained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So whether you're trying to move more, eat better, or improve your sleep, the key isn't speed – it's consistency. Stick with it. With time, the habit will stick with you.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255118/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.octavebio.com/"&gt;Octave&lt;/a&gt; said the test received certification from the New York State Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program (CLEP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That certification is a “major milestone,” Doug Biehn, president and CEO of Octave, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250428661291/en/Octave-MSDA-Test-Gains-NY-State-Certification-Expanding-Access-Nationwide"&gt;company press release&lt;/a&gt;. “The fact that the MSDA Test has achieved this quality standard should give all U.S. physicians the greatest possible confidence in the rigor and reliability of Octave and its MSDA Test results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MS is a chronic disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord. &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS symptoms&lt;/a&gt; can vary widely from person to person. Managing the disease is often complex, and depends mostly on a clinician’s interpretation of symptoms and MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Octave says its MSDA test offers a complementary approach to guide care decisions by providing quantitative data about disease activity. The test measures the levels of &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2023/09/06/octaves-ms-blood-test-accurately-captures-disease-activity-study/"&gt;18 proteins in the blood&lt;/a&gt;, and uses artificial intelligence to make sense of the data and provide real-time reports with “actionable insights,” Octave said. It’s the first validated test of its kind, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Measuring individual patients’ disease activity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given the heterogeneity of MS, having the ability to look beyond the clinical exam and incorporate an individual’s measured disease activity will allow us to focus on managing the needs of each patient,” said Bianca Weinstock-Guttman, MD, a neurology professor at the University at Buffalo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test has been available since 2022, when it was commercially launched, to patients followed in MS centers of excellence, academic institutions, and independent neurology practices across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinicians who have been using it as part of routine MS care say &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2025/04/22/disease-activity-test-helps-ms-care-decisions-study/"&gt;the test has been useful&lt;/a&gt; in guiding treatment decision-making. A study found that in nearly one out of five cases where the test was used, MSDA results led to changes in care decisions, and more than half of the clinicians agreed or strongly agreed that a single MSDA test result helped guide their decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSDA test can be administered to people with MS at any stage of their disease course, including years after disease onset and &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a blood sample is collected, the MSDA test is performed in Octave’s laboratory, which has Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments certification and College of American Pathology accreditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CLEP’s certification, which is based on an &lt;a href="https://wadsworth.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/CLEPGUIDE_Mar2025_FINAL.pdf"&gt;evaluation protocol&lt;/a&gt; to assess the performance of laboratory testing, is another testament to the rigor and reliability of MSDA test results, according to Octave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The MSDA Test has the potential to redefine clinical care for MS patients today and well into the future,” said Weinstock-Guttman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Buxhoeveden, chief scientific officer at the Accelerated Cure Project for Multiple Sclerosis, praised the test’s usefulness. “As a clinician, researcher, advocate and MS patient, I live the challenges of managing MS,” Buxhoeveden said. “The MSDA Test has given me invaluable insights that helped me navigate my own disease while also providing tremendous peace of mind.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Accelerated Cure Project, a nonprofit organization dedicated to accelerating MS research efforts,  contributed data from its biorepository for the development of the MSDA test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Octave MSDA Test is the compass to care that we have been seeking,” Buxhoeveden said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the National Institutes for Health (NIH) today announced the development of the next-generation, universal vaccine platform, Generation Gold Standard, using a beta-propiolactone (BPL)-inactivated, whole-virus platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This initiative represents a decisive shift toward transparency, effectiveness, and comprehensive preparedness, funding the NIH’s in-house development of universal influenza and coronavirus vaccines, including candidates BPL-1357 and BPL-24910. These vaccines aim to provide broad-spectrum protection against multiple strains of pandemic-prone viruses such as H5N1 avian influenza and coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our commitment is clear: every innovation in vaccine development must be grounded in gold standard science and transparency, and subjected to the highest standards of safety and efficacy testing,” said HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program realigns BARDA’s operations with its statutory mission under the Public Health Service Act—to prepare for all influenza viral threats, not just those currently circulating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Generation Gold Standard is a paradigm shift,” said NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. “It extends vaccine protection beyond strain-specific limits and prepares for flu viral threats – not just today’s, but tomorrow’s as well – using traditional vaccine technology brought into the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generation Gold Standard, developed exclusively by NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="spaced"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recalibrates America’s pandemic preparedness&lt;/strong&gt;. Unlike traditional vaccines that target specific strains, BPL-inactivated whole-virus vaccines preserve the virus’s structural integrity while eliminating infectivity. This approach induces robust B and T cell immune responses and offers long-lasting protection across diverse viral families. Moreover, the intranasal formulation of BPL-1357 is currently in Phase Ib and II/III trials and is designed to block virus transmission—an innovation absent from current flu and COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embodies efficient, transparent, and government-led research&lt;/strong&gt;. The BPL platform is fully government-owned and NIH-developed. This approach ensures radical transparency, public accountability, and freedom from commercial conflicts of interest.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marks the future of vaccine development&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition to influenza and coronavirus, the BPL platform is adaptable for future use against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza. It also offers the unprecedented capability to protect against avian influenza without inducing antigenic drift—a major step forward in proactive pandemic prevention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials for universal influenza vaccines are scheduled to begin in 2026, with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval targeted for 2029. The intranasal BPL-1357 flu vaccine, currently in advanced trials, is also on track for FDA review by 2029.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the National Institutes of Health (NIH):&lt;/strong&gt;
NIH, the nation's medical research agency, includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic, clinical, and translational medical research, and is investigating the causes, treatments, and cures for both common and rare diseases.

Older or damaged cells put people at higher risk of cognitive decline and chronic diseases such as &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-6218db20-25e5-11f0-b65d-e37d95cf0d09"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While you can't control your chronological age, eating a Mediterranean diet, being physically active, reducing stress, and eating well can help maintain a lower biological age or turn the clock back further.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analyzing around 14 years' worth of health data from more than 280,000 people in the UK, average age of 57 the researchers found those who developed dementia were biologically older (55 vs. 45) at baseline, according to blood and organ function biomarkers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with the most advanced biological age were about 30 percent more likely to develop dementia than those in the lowest group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the researchers relied on advanced algorithms to calculate people’s biological ages, DailyMail.com has revealed a 24-question quiz that will reveal how old your body really is - despite how many years you've been alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists say that simple tweaks to diet, exercise, and sleep can help reduce a person's biological age, or how old their body's cells and tissues are&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say a good result is a biological age that is slightly younger than the chronological age, or the number of years someone has been alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Longevity experts at NOVOS based in New York City, have made an AI-powered tool that estimates one's biological age without using blood test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The test is free, involves no needles, and is based on results from 47,000 Americans and Europeans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People taking the test first answer questions on their ethnicity, gender, education level, and income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The test also asks users for their arm circumference, which can point to muscle mass and fat distribution. If this is not known, users are told they can input the US average of 13 inches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is also a question on blood pressure where participants used data from the American Heart Association to estimate their blood pressure in cases where they do not know their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A healthy range is 120/80 mmHg, while an unhealthy range is 120 to 129 mmHg and less than 80 mmHg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are asked about lifestyle, including weight gain in recent years, their alcohol consumption, and if they get out of breath walking up stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tool then analyzes the data to reveal a biological age, which is sent to users via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The online calculator is just an estimate as it takes extensive testing to determine a person's biological age.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study by Chinese researchers, the team determined &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13992279/ability-balance-one-leg-old-bones-biological-age.html"&gt;people’s biological ages&lt;/a&gt; by measuring lung function, blood pressure, and cholesterol, as well as other blood biomarkers, including average cell volume and white blood cell count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average chronological age at the study's start was about 57 while the average biological age was around 45. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When dividing the participants into four groups based on biological age, researchers found those with the most advanced biological age were about 30 percent more likely to develop dementia than those in the lowest group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with a higher biological age tended to be older, male, current or former smokers, and carriers of the APOE 4 gene, which is linked to a higher likelihood of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brain scans reveal how accelerated biological aging shrinks critical brain structures, specifically gray matter volume (GMV). Faster aging (measured by KDM-BA and PhenoAge) correlates with reduced gray matter volume in memory and cognitive regions (A-D) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers employed two different algorithms to calculate individuals' biological ages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One, called KDM-BA, uses a machine-learning model that compares nine health measurements in a person - such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and lung function - to population averages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If biomarkers are worse than expected for their chronological age, they receive an older biological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other algorithm, PhenoAge, estimates biological age using 10 measurements - including inflammation and metabolic markers such as glucose - combined with chronological age in a mortality-predicting formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Higher biological age scores calculated by both were tied to smaller volume in the vast majority of people’s brain regions, especially in the hippocampus, where memories are processed and stored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Individuals with a higher biological age as determined by the KDM-BA algorithm, exhibited a thinner cortex, or the brain’s outer layer, in 40 brain regions, particularly those involved in memory and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Individuals with a higher biological age as determined by the PhenoAge algorithm, exhibit cortex thinning across 45 brain areas, with the most significant shrinkage occurring in regions responsible for sensory processing and emotion regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal Neurology, found 36 to 40 regions of the brain that showed thinning were also associated with an increased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bryan's biohacking and restrictive diet have transformed his appearance, shown in 2018 (left) and 2023 (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This cortical thinning accounted for approximately eight percent of the heightened risk associated with accelerated biological aging, indicating it plays a significant – but not exclusive – role in cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While thinning brain tissue contributes to dementia risk, other aging-related factors (like vascular damage or protein buildup) likely drive the majority of the danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the people who later developed dementia had an average chronological age of 65 at the start of the study, compared to 57 for those who stayed free of dementia, their average biological age was 55 by one of the methods, compared to 45 for those with no dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Yacong Bo, a researcher at Zhengzhou University in China, said: ‘These brain structure changes explain some, but not all, of the association between advanced biological age and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘These results support the hypothesis that advanced biological age may contribute to the development of dementia by causing a widespread change in brain structures.’&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in good news for those seeking to turn back the hands of time, reducing stress can lower your biological age by just a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists also argue that simple tweaks to diet, exercise, and sleep can help reduce a person's biological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And biohacking in the quest for longevity has surged in popularity in recent years, with followers trying to reduce their biological age to live longer and avoid illnesses such as heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Famous biohacker Bryan Johnson, 47, claims the biological age of his lungs is 18. He also claims to have the heart of a 37-year-old, the skin of a 28-year-old, the gum inflammation of a 17-year-old, and the nighttime erection rate of a teenager.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Bo said: ‘With the rising impact of dementia around the world, identifying risk factors and implementing preventive measures is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘While none of us can change our chronological age, we can influence our biological age through lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:39:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>超加工食品导致过早死亡。以下是4个常见的罪魁祸首-雅虎 | Ultra-processed foods are driving premature deaths.

A recent study published in the &lt;a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(25)00072-8/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Journal of Preventive Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Journal of Preventive Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; showed that higher consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) is significantly linked to increased premature deaths (between ages 30 and 69).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Analyzing data from eight countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, U.K., and U.S.), researchers found that each 10% rise in UPFs’ proportion of total caloric intake raised all-cause mortality risk by 3%. In countries with the highest UPF consumption—like the U.S.—up to 14% of premature deaths are attributable to UPFs, according to the study. For instance, researchers found that in 2018, 124,000 premature deaths in the U.S. were due to the consumption of UPFs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“UPFs affect health beyond the individual impact of high content of…sodium, trans fats, and sugar because of the changes in the foods during industrial processing and the use of artificial ingredients, including colorants, artificial flavors and sweeteners, emulsifiers, and many other additives and processing aids,” &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/ultraprocessed-foods-mortality-28663/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; lead investigator of the study Eduardo Augusto Fernandes Nilson. “So assessing deaths from all-causes associated with UPF consumption allows an overall estimate of the effect of industrial food processing on health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 ultra-processed foods to avoid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ultra-processed foods are commonly defined under a classification known as&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224421004970#sec3" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NOVA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; NOVA&lt;/a&gt;, defining them as containing additives and undergoing significant alterations from their natural state. They tend to be calorie-dense, low in nutrients, and often have long shelf lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While this study didn’t look at individual foods’ impact on premature death and mortality risk, another &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/385/bmj-2023-078476" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study from last year;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;study from last year&lt;/a&gt; did. Those researchers found that the following foods were linked with the highest all-cause mortality risk:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sugary and artificially sweetened beverages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4

cereal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In that study, researchers found that participants whose diets contained the highest proportion of UPFs had a 4% higher risk of all-cause mortality, as well as an 8% higher risk of mortality from neurodegenerative diseases, compared to those who ate the least ultra-processed food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“All new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure – a radical departure from past practices,” an HHS spokesperson told the Washington Post, in response to questions about general vaccine policy and the measles vaccine. The department did not clarify what it meant by “new vaccine”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The department spokesperson also described new surveillance systems for vaccines, “that will accurately measure vaccine risks as well as benefits – because real science demands both transparency and accountability”, but did not elaborate on the design of those systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prior to being confirmed to the role of health secretary, Kennedy was arguably the nation’s most prominent anti-vaccine advocate and led a non-profit known for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/13/majority-antivaxx-vaccine-ads-facebook-funded-by-two-organizations-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;prolific misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. He also &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/us/rfk-jr-finances.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;earned money&lt;/a&gt; by referring clients to law firms suing vaccine makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Among the claims Kennedy spread was that medications cause “autoimmune injuries and allergic injuries and neurodevelopmental injuries that have long diagnostic horizons or long incubation periods, so you can do the study and you will not see the injury for five years”, he said in an interview in 2021, according to reporting by the Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy also claimed this week that the MMR vaccine includes “aborted fetus debris”. The rubella vaccine, like many vaccines, is produced using &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/fetal-tissues" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;decades-old sterile fetal cell lines&lt;/a&gt; derived from two elective terminations in the 1960s, including the rubella vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Vaccines against new pathogens, such as Covid-19, are placebo tested. However, experts consider new placebo-controlled trials for long-time vaccines, for instance measles, to be unethical because it would effectively deny a patient a known intervention while potentially exposing them to a dangerous disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“No institutional review board at any academic center would ever accept that – so he’s asking what personal injury lawyer invariably asks for, which is the impossible to be done,” said Offit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although Kennedy has made false and misleading statements about vaccines generally, the Covid-19 vaccine appears to be especially in the administration’s crosshairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In response to recent &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/26/rfk-jr-chronic-disease-covid" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;questions about Covid-19 strategy&lt;/a&gt; from the Guardian, the administration responded: “The Covid-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Health officials have reportedly required all research grant applications on messenger RNA technology, which powers most Covid-19 vaccines, be &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/trump-vaccine-skeptics-research-funding" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;flagged to Kennedy’s office&lt;/a&gt;. They have also ended research that tested for the Covid-19 vaccine’s safety and efficacy in special groups, such as pregnant women, as part of an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/rfk-hhs-layoffs-lawsuit" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$11bn clawback&lt;/a&gt; in grants from states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Most controversially, the Food and Drug Administration has delayed expected approval of a new Covid-19 vaccine from Novavax, reportedly on the review of a political appointee known to be skeptical of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Over the weekend, FDA commissioner Marty Makary addressed the delay by describing annual updates to the vaccine’s strains as a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/27/fda-covid-vaccine-approval-process-novavax-pfizer-moderna/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“new” product&lt;/a&gt;, creating confusion about whether vaccine makers have to conduct new safety and efficacy trials. Such trials would not be a normal part of routine updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;On Monday, the company &lt;a href="https://ir.novavax.com/press-releases/Latest-update-on-U-S-FDA-BLA-for-Novavaxs-COVID-19-Vaccine-1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; that said in part the FDA had demanded a clinical trial as part of post-approval surveillance, and that it would continue to work with the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:18:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxObDZOYUotSWVydXpzdmpWRUtCcVFaRFQtc0J2c3JsUlJmU0tiaVc0NHc3dTJYWlg4N2xHZW1lakFha25wSEJGVHRTcl9vTVdoelJydC05ajVxTFJZM1BfRHp5QkRGLXlSYWNQQTJwbTg3d1ZIVzdiNFphZlVrYkFfZFRB</guid></item><item><title>科学家探索意识在大脑中产生的位置-路透社 | Scientists explore where consciousness arises in the brain - Reuters</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxOQzE0U0Y5TlNxUFdWOW00YWVyR01UUFJzNUdoWThJMTc5ZGt6aG5BSXNRS1lFLUJHRDRKdEY3dWZzQlZiS3Q4RHF1S0g4Vk94dzZrQy1OVDNmQXpCbjRNSkZzVmFjQXFmaFZWWEJRMW9XSmFESWZXaDJ0Zlo0TWgwZ2hucWdrQkI3QWJ6R2ZWZmRVOTh1QjBwaFBESQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:12:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxOQzE0U0Y5TlNxUFdWOW00YWVyR01UUFJzNUdoWThJMTc5ZGt6aG5BSXNRS1lFLUJHRDRKdEY3dWZzQlZiS3Q4RHF1S0g4Vk94dzZrQy1OVDNmQXpCbjRNSkZzVmFjQXFmaFZWWEJRMW9XSmFESWZXaDJ0Zlo0TWgwZ2hucWdrQkI3QWJ6R2ZWZmRVOTh1QjBwaFBESQ</guid></item><item><title>坏人会来吗？研究发现大多数业力信徒都这么认为- CNN | Do bad people have it coming?

            When it comes to karma, most people believe the universe is their own personal cheerleader — but an exacting judge for everyone else, according to a new study published May 1 by the &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/rel-rel0000565.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;American Psychological Association&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Psychology of Religion and Spirituality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6w00023j6npdqjy3qg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers asked more than 2,000 people from various &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/23/health/francis-collins-faith-science-public-health-wellness/index.html"&gt;religious&lt;/a&gt; and nonreligious backgrounds to write about their experiences with karma — the belief that good deeds are rewarded, and bad actions are punished — and a common through-line of their responses emerged.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6w00033j6n6bwa318q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the participants wrote about themselves, 59% told tales of being rewarded for their good deeds. In their stories about others, 92% chronicled how misfortune befell cheating partners, indebted friends, bullies and lousy coworkers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6w00043j6n2n0d7pfv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Thinking about karma allows people to take personal credit and feel pride in good things that happen to them even when it isn’t clear exactly what they did to create the good outcome,” the study’s senior author, Cindel White, said in a statement. “But it also allows people to see other people’s suffering as justified retribution.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6w00053j6ni5ppszpe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings offer a window into the way our minds form judgments about ourselves and those around us, said White, an assistant professor at York University in Toronto who studies how psychological motives interact with spirituality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6w00063j6ne6k5st9s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I firmly believe in providing charitable donations to those in need, no matter how small,” one anonymous response from the study reads. “Doing so has benefited me greatly and occasionally has led to individuals doing me favors without asking.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6w00073j6ndp1frl71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another reads, “I knew a guy who was always rude and cruel to everyone; he never did anything nice his entire life. He was diagnosed with cancer, and I just couldn’t help but think that was karma.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x00083j6nes8lpjpl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study identifies the tendency to see yourself as deserving of good fortune, even in the absence of direct causes, as a form of “attribution bias,” — a concept which has been studied by psychologists for decades, said Patrick Heck, a research psychologist at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, commenting in his personal capacity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x00093j6nawcwukih@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Attribution theory and attribution biases are the general idea that people attribute certain things that happen to them or other people in line with ways that make them feel good about themselves,” said Heck, who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000a3j6ncwtktlap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In some ways, attribution bias serves the purpose of promoting self-esteem, which helps people overcome challenges in life, White said. But other times, it could lead people astray when they fail to recognize the contributions of others or the external factors of success.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000b3j6nzuvul9o3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On the other side of the coin, the belief that other people’s suffering is a form of punishment comes from a need to believe that the world is just. This belief can help people make sense of the complexity of life, Heck said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000c3j6ne2tzclw3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “(The world) is full of statistical noise. Random things happen to people all the time. And we know from lots of research in psychology that people struggle to reconcile randomness in their lives,” Heck said. “It’s very compelling to want to have a story or an explanation for why good things happen to some people and why bad things happen to other people. … I think karma is a really nicely packaged way that maybe has found its way into religion and other belief systems.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000d3j6n4mas26ta@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The concept of karma originates from Asian religious traditions such as Hinduism and Buddhism, and many variations exist in how it’s practiced between different groups, White said. For this reason, the study sampled participants from the United States, Singapore and India to get a broad range of cultural and religious backgrounds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000e3j6nxs6p3ygt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Notably, results skewed slightly differently between Western and non-Western respondents, with Indian and Singaporean participants showing less self-enhancing bias — a finding that is consistent with &lt;a href="https://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/Manuscripts/WhiteNorenzayanSchaller-PSPB%202018.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000f3j6nbqiz35hw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We found very similar patterns across multiple cultural contexts, including Western samples, where we know people often think about themselves in exaggeratedly positive ways, and samples from Asian countries where people are more likely to be self-critical,” White said. “But across all countries, participants were much more likely to say that other people face karmic punishments while they receive karmic rewards.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000g3j6n2cialb2d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            White said her future research will explore how these beliefs around karma affect decision-making.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000h3j6nd3ihk242@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s sometimes differences between your religious beliefs, what people actually think about in everyday life, and then how they act,” White said. “There could be other situations where they are prompted by the experience itself, and they’re going to think about karma in a very different way.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000i3j6nrxshljs1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, belief-driven biases can have broad, real-world implications, especially when it comes to policymaking and our justice system, Heck said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000j3j6nlf56pj3r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Often, social prejudices such as racism and classism function on the premise that an “inferior” group earned its status by behaving in a way that is socially unacceptable, said Yudit Jung, an adjunct associate professor of psychology at Emory University in Atlanta who was not involved in the research. Such views can then inform people’s treatment of those groups and their willingness to offer help.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000k3j6nb1kemc0d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ultimately, Jung, who is also a practicing psychoanalyst, said she believes the studied biases are common to most people. They can be a form of defense, originating from early childhood experiences and the need to feel secure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4nub6x000l3j6n028q39fb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I work with patients a lot on (developing) compassion and a sense of shared humanity, recognizing that we are all a mixture of good and bad,” Jung said. “It’s not about influencing religion. It’s about a patient’s basic ethics.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

ROACH: Since starting blood thinners, I’m unable to continue anti-inflammatories for ongoing arthritis pain. Is there a safe arthritis pain medication other than Tylenol? I am a 72-year-old male on meds for atrial fibrillation, Type 2 diabetes, cholesterol, and a hiatal hernia. Would the maximum daily amount of Tylenol to minimize the pain be too high over an extended period of time? -- L.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="J42SYGY5AZABLD57N6JUM7QW5U"&gt;ANSWER: People taking anticoagulant drugs like warfarin, or one of the newer direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOAC) like apixaban, are at a significantly increased risk of bleeding when they also take anti-inflammatory drugs like naproxen or ibuprofen. Most patients are recommended against using these drugs together. Sometimes after a careful discussion of the risks and benefits, a person on an anticoagulant will be prescribed an anti-inflammatory, but most of the time, they are avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3Y7CF2DJGZCIHKK7V5YPE52NFI"&gt;Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is much safer to use in combination with a DOAC. The maximum dose of Tylenol I recommend in older patients is 3,000 mg, or two extra-strength pills three times daily. I do not recommend this high a dose in some situations, such as an older person with liver disease who is very small in size (120 pounds or less) or who drinks moderate amounts of alcohol. However, adding Tylenol to warfarin (but not a DOAC) can cause the bleeding risk to go up when using a relatively high dose of Tylenol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MUS2BFQPCFG7JJYOXT5ZJALLRY"&gt;One option is an anti-inflammatory gel like diclofenac, which isn’t absorbed as well into the body, so they don’t put a person at risk. But it can penetrate superficial joints like the hands and knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: I’m a female who is 63 years old. My blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg. I’m 98 pounds, and my heart doctor believes that I might be one of those people who produces cholesterol. My total cholesterol is 241 mg/dL, my LDL is 168 mg/dL, and my HDL is 65 mg/dL. My doctor did a calcium score, and the result was 31. Should I take cholesterol meds? -- W.P.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DY3L5CBY4ZE2LJK6CSO5IPQBQE"&gt;ANSWER: There are several decision tools to help doctors and patients evaluate the potential benefits of cholesterol medication, and they start with estimating your risk of having a heart attack or stroke during the next 10 years. Since you have had a coronary calcium scan, the most appropriate tool to use is the MESA score (tinyurl.com/mesascore).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Y5UK5XY2EFDEFN54NAIMXWWDJM"&gt;When I put in your information, it gave a 10-year risk of 3.5%. This is a level at which giving a medication like a statin would only have a minuscule benefit for you, and statins always have a small risk of causing side effects (such as muscle pain). It can also cause blood sugar levels to go up slightly. Experts do not recommend treatment for you at this level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7GLGBKFVCRGJ5IZECQMYAJXZKI"&gt;All humans make cholesterol. Statin drugs work by preventing our body from making as much cholesterol as we otherwise would by blocking an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase. A drug in a different class called ezetimibe works by reducing the amount of cholesterol you can absorb from food. The two together are more effective at lowering cholesterol than either alone, but I do not recommend any medication for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BNVOADI6KNBHDG3XCBWPHCKOQY"&gt;Having a healthy, mostly plant diet (like a Mediterranean-style diet), along with regular exercise, would have a much bigger impact on keeping you healthier than a statin, since a good diet and exercise reduces many health risks, including cancer and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NPEUKDHL6JGKFPCJEMJSW2QXWY"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human beings exhibit marked differences in habits, lifestyles and behavioral tendencies. One of these differences, known as chronotype, is the inclination to sleep and wake up early or alternatively to sleep and wake up late.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Changes in society, such as the introduction of portable devices and video streaming services, may have also influenced people's behavioral patterns, offering them further distractions that could occupy their evenings or late nights. Yet past studies have found that sleeping and waking up late is often linked to a higher risk of being diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mental+health+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mental health disorders&lt;/a&gt;, such as depression and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/anxiety+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;anxiety disorders&lt;/a&gt;, as well as poorer physical health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of humans' chronotypes, as well as the possible implications of being a so-called "morning person" or "night owl," could thus be beneficial. Specifically, it could inform the development of lifestyle interventions or &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medical+treatments/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical treatments&lt;/a&gt; designed to promote healthy sleeping patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at McGill University, the Mila–Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute and other institutes recently carried out a study exploring the neurobiological underpinnings of people's natural tendency to be more active at specific times of the day. Their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02182-w" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/i&gt;, unveil associations between chronotype and specific trends in the structure of the brain, as well as reward processing and the regulation of emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"As an explicit manifestation of circadian rhythms, chronotype is closely intertwined with physical and mental health," Le Zhou, Karin Saltoun and their colleagues wrote in their paper. "Night owls often exhibit unhealthier lifestyle habits, are more susceptible to mood disorders and have poorer physical fitness compared with early risers. Although &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/individual+differences/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;individual differences&lt;/a&gt; in chronotype yield varying consequences, their neurobiological underpinnings remain elusive."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary objective of this recent study by Zhou, Saltoun and their colleagues was to explore the link between chronotype and various phenotypes (i.e., characteristics or traits arising from the interaction between a person's genes and their environment). In addition, it was aimed at determining whether the brains of morning people and night owls exhibit some differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To work toward these goals, the researchers analyzed data from one of the largest biomedical databases compiled to date, the UK Biobank. Their analyses focused on the chronotype of included individuals, as well as imaging scans capturing their brains and various phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We conducted a pattern-learning analysis with three brain-imaging modalities (gray matter volume, white-matter integrity and functional connectivity) and capitalized on 976 phenotypes in 27,030 UK Biobank participants," wrote the researchers. "The resulting multilevel analysis reveals convergence on the basal ganglia, limbic system, hippocampus and cerebellum. The pattern derived from modeling actigraphy wearables data of daily movement further highlighted these key brain features."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, this study is one of the most comprehensive explorations of the neurobiology of chronotypes carried out to date. The findings it gathered suggest that chronotype is deeply rooted in the biology of the brain, while also confirming its connections with people's unique traits, learning, emotional regulation and behavioral patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recent work could soon inform future research aimed at further exploring the neurobiological differences between morning people and night owls. Eventually, it could also contribute to the development of targeted interventions to treat mental health conditions or improve people's lifestyle, which also account for chronotype-related factors.&lt;/p&gt;

Red meat comes from non-fowl mammals (a.k.a. animals that aren’t birds). Beef, pork, lamb, venison, and boar are examples of red meat. Chicken and turkey, on the other hand, are white meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, red meat &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7015455/#:~:text=Red%20meat%20is%20a%20nutrient%20dense%20food%20that%20is%20an,B12%20in%20the%20diet." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:contains key nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;contains key nutrients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like protein, vitamin B12, and zinc. Its major flex? Red meat is a top source of heme iron—the kind most readily absorbed by your body, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/before-during-after/iron-blood-donation/iron-rich-foods.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Red Cross;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Red Cross&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—though you can also find heme iron in chicken and turkey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But be warned: With the buzz around protein online, the pros of red meat might be getting overstated, especially at the expense of the cons.

Here’s a breakdown of the pros and cons of red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It can help keep you full.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some content creators swear by red meat for its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40steakandbuttergal%2Fvideo%2F7482085354737028395&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64637530%2Fis-red-meat-good-for-you%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:satiating power;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;satiating power&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the science backs that up. Red meat is loaded with protein that keeps hunger at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Protein naturally boosts satiety,” says Kim Johnson, RD, the founder of Nourish/d Wellness. “It keeps you fuller, longer.” That’s partly because it takes more time and energy for your body to break it down, she says. (BTW, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a19993913/protein-breakfast-ideas/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein in general has this effect;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;protein &lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;in general&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt; has this effect&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so white meat options like chicken should also keep you feeling satiated.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For that reason, Johnson recommends enjoying red meat earlier in the day, ideally a couple of hours before bed, to give your body time to digest. But here’s the kicker: it’s not just the meat that keeps you full—it’s eating adequate calories that helps you feel truly satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It supports muscle growth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to build strength and support lean muscle, red meat might just deserve a spot on your plate. It’s a complete protein source, meaning it packs all nine essential amino acids your body needs for muscle repair and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, it contains &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64174301/how-much-creatine-should-i-take/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:creatine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;creatine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—which has &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a44716483/creatine-for-women/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:legit benefits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;legit benefits&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to strength and performance—along with B vitamins that help convert food into energy and keep your muscles functioning at their best. You’ll also get a healthy dose of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g19967379/signs-youre-not-getting-zinc/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:zinc;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;zinc&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a key player in muscle recovery and overall health, per a 2020 study in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213231720301312" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Redox Biology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Redox Biology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And, you’ll get some iron, which supports muscle growth and function, per a 2023 study in the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jcsm.13277" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia, and Muscle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia, and Muscle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s the most bioavailable source of heme iron.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some women intentionally include red meat &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40catherineirvin%3Fis_from_webapp%3D1%26sender_device%3Dpc&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64637530%2Fis-red-meat-good-for-you%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:during their follicular phase;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;during their follicular phase&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to help replenish iron levels—and there might be something behind the strategy. Red meat is a top-tier source of iron, a nutrient many &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62514296/weird-signs-of-iron-deficiency/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:women tend to fall short on;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;women tend to fall short on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, especially during menstruation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, it’s not just iron. Red meat is rich in zinc and B vitamins, all of which are essential for hormone health and energy, according to Johnson. “If you find yourself seriously craving meat, it might be your body’s way of signaling a need for more iron, protein, or zinc,” says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no science specifically citing red meat consumption to be beneficial during a woman’s cycle, however, and you can also get these nutrients from other sources like poultry, seafood, shellfish, and plant-based options, says Anjali Prasertong, MPH, RD, the writer of the weekly newsletter Antiracist Dietitian. And it’s not like red meat is the end all be all of a healthy period. “Hormonal health is best supported by consistent and sustainable nutritional variety, stress management, and avoiding restrictive eating,” says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s tasty.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in case you wondered, yes! That’s a good enough reason to add it to your plate. There's no point in eating in a way that's “unsustainable and virtually joyless,” says Abby Langer, RD, the founder of Abby Langer Nutrition and author of &lt;em&gt;Good Food, Bad Diet&lt;/em&gt;. So, if you want to eat red meat because it’s tasty—there’s benefit in that too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And now, some of the potential risks of red meat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It may increase your risk of heart disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest cons of eating red meat is its potential to harm &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64343593/dhrps-heart-health-measurement-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;. Processed and non-processed red meat consumption is associated with an increased risk of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64619518/walking-activity-quick-bursts-heart-disease-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; in both men and women, according to a 2023 systematic review in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/44/28/2626/7188739" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:European Heart Journal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because the high saturated fat content in red meat can cause cholesterol levels to rise, says Johnson. Compared to white meat, red meat usually has more saturated fat—and processed meats have even more than unprocessed cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Heart Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recommends that just six percent of your total daily calories come from saturated fat. That means if you’re consuming 2,000 calories, only 120 of them should be from saturated fats, which shakes out to about 13 grams. Particularly as it pertains to diets that are heavy on red meat, it could take a toll on your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64232705/sharell-weeams-heart-attack-essay/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;, Johnson says. “Over time, your risk of cardiovascular disease increases, your LDL cholesterol is very likely to increase, as well as blood pressure and inflammation,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s linked with certain types of cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating more than 12 to 18 ounces of red meat per week has also been linked to a higher chance of getting colorectal cancer, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.aicr.org/cancer-prevention/recommendations/limit-consumption-of-red-and-processed-meat/#what-the-science-says" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Institute for Cancer Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Institute for Cancer Research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (AICR), especially when done at the expense of eating whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and beans. Red meat and processed meat increase colorectal cancer risk by 30 and 40 percent, respectively, according to a 2024 study in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38112776/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers, and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers, and Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are still trying to learn more about how exactly red and processed meats are linked with cancer, but the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(15)00444-1/abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:classifies processed meat as a Group 1 carcinogen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;classifies processed meat as a Group 1 carcinogen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (the highest level), meaning there is sufficient evidence that it causes cancer in humans. Red meat is group 2, which makes it a probable carcinogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, it’s not just &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a36366953/color-cancer-symptoms-women/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:colon cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;.

Additionally, several large &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8118195/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIH studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;NIH studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have also demonstrated an association between the consumption of heme iron and the development of colorectal cancer and breast cancer in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s linked to type-2 diabetes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red meat, especially the processed kind (think: hot dogs and deli meats), has been linked to a higher risk of type-2 &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a60525665/type-2-diabetes-food-list/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, per a 2024 meta-analysis in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00179-7/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Lancet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Lancet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The number is steep, according to the research. Participants in a 2023 study in the &lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(23)66119-2/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Journal of Clinical Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who consumed the most red and processed meat had a 64 percent higher risk of developing type-2 diabetes compared to those who ate the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side: swapping red meat for more plant-based foods—like beans, nuts, and whole grains—can lower the risk of both heart disease and diabetes, according to a 2023 review in &lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-03093-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:BMC Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;BMC Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between red meat and type-2 diabetes comes down to three factors, based on the studies above: saturated fat, heme iron, and inflammatory compounds—all of which can mess with the way your body uses insulin and even damage the cells to produce it, which can lead to type-2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed red meats may increase dementia risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red meat might also mess with your brain health. Eating processed red meats like bacon, sausages, and salami increases dementia risk by 13 percent, according to a 2025 study in &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000210286" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Neurology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Neurology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Just one fourth of a serving per day increased the risk, compared to those who ate processed meat less frequently. One serving of unprocessed red meat also saw a 16 percent increased risk of self-reported cognitive decline, per the same study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, how much red meat should we be eating?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are risks associated with red meat, you don’t need to avoid that section of the grocery store entirely. “We don't have to just completely give up red meat,” says Johnson. “It’s all about what kind, how much, and how often.” Red meat can fit into a balanced diet, she says, and she recommends eating red meat once or twice a week in three to four ounce portions (even less frequently than the &lt;a href="https://www.aicr.org/cancer-prevention/recommendations/limit-consumption-of-red-and-processed-meat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:AIRC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AIRC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests women cap their red meat consumption at 12 to 18 cooked ounces per week) and minimizing processed meats as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, the claims and diets promoting more frequent consumption might not be backed by experts or science. “I wouldn't recommend it every day,” says Langer. “But once or twice a week, in a moderate amount, is fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just that people online are advocating consuming more red meat, it’s also that they’re eating mostly—or only—red meat. “I'm not against red meat, I’m just against a diet being predominantly one food group,” Langer says. “A variety of food means that we're getting a variety of nutrients.” When it comes to all-meat diets, you're losing out on a lot of the protective nutrients, like high fiber carbs, non-starchy vegetables, antioxidants, and micronutrients, Johnson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blanket statements from red-meat promoters online like “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40steakandbuttergal%2Fvideo%2F7484372490421046574%3F_r%3D1%26_t%3DZT-8vlFPWZF5RL&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64637530%2Fis-red-meat-good-for-you%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I thrive without fiber;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;I thrive without fiber&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” or “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40catherineirvin%2Fvideo%2F7494016997382950175&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64637530%2Fis-red-meat-good-for-you%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I'm a daily ground beef girl;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;I'm a daily ground beef girl&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” may work for social media, but maybe not so much for people's real lives, Prasertong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Find The Healthiest Red Meat Options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all red meat is created equal. Processed meats carry some of the highest risks (according to the research above), and you’ll also want to put some consideration into the fat content of your red meat and how it was raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to enjoy beef, try choosing lean cuts like sirloin or tenderloin to avoid going overboard on calories or saturated fat, says Johnson. When it comes to ground meat, check the label for cuts that are at least 90 percent to keep saturated fat lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, our experts say there are some benefits to grass fed cuts, but you don’t need to break the bank for them. “Grass-fed beef does have a better omega-3 profile compared to conventional beef, but it's not going to be your main source of omega-3, so just kind of think of that as a nutritional bonus, and not a substitute for something like salmon,” says Johnson. “The real benefit is overall quality and how the animal was raised.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Cut Back On Red Meat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divide Your Plate Into Sections:&lt;/strong&gt; Build your plate around plants instead of making meat “the main event of the meal,” says Johnson. Half of your plate should be non-starchy vegetables, like spinach salad, asparagus, and mixed vegetables. Then, one forth of your plate can be protein, like chicken, fish, or steak. The remaining one fourth of your plate can be high-fiber carbs like sweet potatoes, quinoa, or whole wheat pasta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut Your Portion In Half:&lt;/strong&gt; “Cut your red meat portions in half and replace that half with a non-heme plant,” says Johnson. For example, if you are using ground beef for taco night, you could use half of your ground beef and use black beans or lentils as the other half. This would decrease your red meat intake while adding other nutrients like fiber to your meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swap Your Red Meat For Something Leaner:&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of using red meat, swap it for a leaner source of protein, like chicken, turkey, fish, or shellfish, says Johnson. For example, ground beef can be swapped for ground turkey to make turkey burgers, or chili and ground chicken can be made into meatballs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick A Few Meals A Week That Are Plant-Based: &lt;/strong&gt;If you’re transitioning toward a plant-based diet, Langer recommends aiming for at least two to three meatless meals per week. Try using tofu, beans, lentils, and tempeh as a main protein source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re cutting back on meat, it’s important to know how to get the most out of your non-heme iron sources like lentils, chickpeas, tofu, spinach, and quinoa. “Pair them with vitamin C-rich foods to help your body absorb the iron more effectively,” Johnson says. Think: lentils with bell peppers, chickpeas with tomatoes, or a spinach and berry smoothie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also

That included monitoring a woman’s bones and to make sure her lipids (organic compounds) are elevated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A variety of modern treatments for menopausal symptoms do not make endometriosis grow and are non-hormonal, he said, and fertility-sparing surgeries are also available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Pecoraro said women going through the menopause transition – even if on medication for symptoms – should see their doctor at least every one to two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 12:21:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixgFBVV95cUxPUVZUbDhSRkhwa250WDJkNWhRYnozb0h1eG96VWRSSDdXSlVRWDZBNGlpc0t0YU5VOHhSLUR0Ykp1Q0xBNkFaMjZXRXlQQU1CajI3M192WG1DMHZsV0djYzFfa2pnaTg4MFN2TjkzSUhIYXZIb0lSODM5a19fMFRoRUxuQzJLakowZ0xHYm9GT20yZThmb29qUEVDWC1Ud3N1eEhJMGhEWXZ3Qzc1YS1NM2I3bTNMRERHQzJhRFgxUGc5Snp1M1E</guid></item><item><title>麻疹在加拿大、墨西哥和美国爆发，跨越北美边境-美联社新闻 | Measles jumps borders in North America with outbreaks in Canada, Mexico and US - AP News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPS2dDdXhZeFVEUWtNTHhKbjFXYlQ0ZEU3bVFrTkNERnBlcFJXdXBaNjEyaE92R2dLYWxfVmhLV3pwbXN3a0pOREtndGRfUlhqS1JaRWpZZEVIUTRfNDg4RWhseFFkTm5UMjJ5QW0xZWYtdWZHR3p6SWdWM2hkN2ZfVTFzS3VFQTlyc19VMnJIZlMzYnluUUlzNUx2WQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxPS2dDdXhZeFVEUWtNTHhKbjFXYlQ0ZEU3bVFrTkNERnBlcFJXdXBaNjEyaE92R2dLYWxfVmhLV3pwbXN3a0pOREtndGRfUlhqS1JaRWpZZEVIUTRfNDg4RWhseFFkTm5UMjJ5QW0xZWYtdWZHR3p6SWdWM2hkN2ZfVTFzS3VFQTlyc19VMnJIZlMzYnluUUlzNUx2WQ</guid></item><item><title>顶级营养师经常食用5种高蛋白、高纤维食物，而不是肉类，以改善肠道健康- Business Insider | 5 high-protein, high-fiber foods a top nutritionist eats regularly instead of meat for better gut health - Business Insider</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNSUJqbjY5OFVPUEt4bDhwQ29fVm5WWjhXSGZEUzJ0bUtNQ0FwRTM5Q3ZjOE8tOS1WY0hHdWtLMllBOWpzT3N4U01xR2psUHNSejlYWHFxTWdKMHlDZEhWdW42QnhmMkIwQlV3c0p2WWYydS1NcmlRcHgzbGlRaDdrTE5NU1k3TkJwNHFRRzhKZi0wZHZSOUMtN0k1dGotWXdJVWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="post-body-content post-story-body-content" data-component-type="post-body-content" data-load-strategy="exclude" data-track-content="" data-post-type="story"&gt;
            
              &lt;p&gt;You don't need to be scoffing steaks or gorging on protein shakes to get enough of the macronutrient — a top nutritionist says &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-nutritious-plant-based-proteins-soy-seitan-pulses-2021-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;plant-based protein&lt;/a&gt; is the best kind, and better for your gut health than meat, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federica Amati, Ph.D., is the lead nutritionist at ZOE, a science and nutrition company, and a postdoctoral medical scientist at Imperial College London. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/high-protein-foods-rule-easy-fat-loss-lose-pounds-2024-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Hitting protein targets&lt;/a&gt; is currently a huge health trend. But Amati told Business Insider that most people get enough, and don't need to worry about eating more protein unless they're an athlete or actively trying to change their body composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; people get their protein from matters, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amati referred to a 2024 study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition involving 50,000 healthy nurses aged 30-55 at the start of the study, between 1984 and 2016. The nurses who ate more protein, and specifically &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/eat-more-protein-boost-gut-health-same-time-easy-doctor-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;plant protein&lt;/a&gt;, had a higher chance of being free from 11 major chronic diseases, having good mental health, and not having cognitive or physical impairments as they aged. Meanwhile, participants who ate more animal protein had an increased risk of chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding is echoed in a 2021 study by researchers at the University of Oxford, published in the journal BMC Medicine. The 474,985 middle-aged British participants who ate more red and processed meat were more likely to develop heart disease, pneumonia, diabetes, and growths in the colon. Participants who ate more poultry were at higher risk of gastrointestinal diseases and diabetes, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amati said the results of the 2024 study suggested that the health benefits came from eating more fruit, vegetable, and whole foods, not protein. The researchers argued this could be because the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-spector-increase-fiber-plant-based-protein-sources-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;dietary fiber&lt;/a&gt;, micronutrients, and polyphenols in plant foods are associated with positive health effects, including reduced low-density lipoprotein, or "bad," cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and decreased inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                      Amati still eats some animal proteins, but gets most of her intake of the macronutrient through plants.

            &lt;p&gt;Amati still has animal-based proteins: She eats oily fish twice a week, and eggs and fermented dairy — kefir and Greek yogurt specifically — regularly. But most of her protein comes from plants, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you don't go fully plant-based, research suggests it's possible to make a "huge" reduction in your chronic disease risk by replacing some animal protein with plants, Amati said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She shared some of the best sources of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-spector-increase-fiber-plant-based-protein-sources-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;high-fiber plant protein&lt;/a&gt; that she eats regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1b82631c-db68-416f-9860-0e05347d85d9" data-toc-id="1b82631c-db68-416f-9860-0e05347d85d9"&gt;Nutritional yeast&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/nutritional-yeast" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Nutritional yeast&lt;/a&gt;, or "nooch," is deactivated yeast that has a cheesy flavor and contains B vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a nice example of a food that has both protein and fiber," Amati said. In terms of nutritional value, 100 grams of nooch contains about 50 grams of protein and about 20 grams of fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-mediterranean-diet-chef-adds-plant-based-protein-to-meals-2025-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;dietitian who follows the Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; previously told BI she incorporates nooch into her diet by sprinkling it on savory dishes as a cheese replacement. Amati's colleague at ZOE, the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/top-nutrition-scientist-tim-spector-foods-kitchen-gut-health-easy-2025-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;gut health expert Tim Spector&lt;/a&gt;, uses it instead of bouillon cubes to add flavor to his cooking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="3750505b-b354-44bf-95ec-09a54c636def" data-toc-id="3750505b-b354-44bf-95ec-09a54c636def"&gt;Soy products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/is-soy-bad-for-you" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Soy products&lt;/a&gt; are good sources of protein and fiber. For example, there are about 10 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber in 100 grams of edamame beans, and around 20 grams of protein and 7 grams of fiber in 100 grams of tempeh. And 100 grams of tofu contains about 8 grams of protein but less than 1 gram of fiber.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;A 2020 study looking at 210,000 people, published in Circulation, an American Heart Association journal,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;found that participants who ate at least one serving of tofu a week had a lower risk of heart disease than those who ate it less than once a month. The researchers suggested that this may have been because the estrogen-like compounds in tofu could have led to effects that mirror the beneficial effects of estrogen in women who weren't taking supplemental hormones — or because the fiber and minerals found in tofu help to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="3d5bd72e-b8c9-46b9-80cf-14521279c859" data-toc-id="3d5bd72e-b8c9-46b9-80cf-14521279c859"&gt;Oats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amati often eats oatmeal or &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trying-ree-drummond-easy-overnight-oats-recipe" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;overnight oats&lt;/a&gt; in the morning, adding kefir, chia seeds, and fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

Anything more than that and you're entering the world of diminishing returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the research (which analyzed 2,000 people across 67 studies) when it comes to actual strength gain, the amount required is even lower.

It also, unfortunately, means ticks â€” including those that play host to bacteria that cause Lyme disease,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the most common tick-borne illness in the US. The bacteria, which larval ticks pick up when they feed on infected rodents, can cause headache, joint pain, a telltale bullseye rash, and more serious symptoms in humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Lyme-transmitting ticks, known as black-legged or deer ticks, were once largely balkanized to coastal New England. (The disease is named for a Connecticut town where researchers in the 1970s first described it, although &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/ancient-history-of-lyme-disease-in-north-america-revealed-with-bacterial-genomes/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;it has existed for millennia&lt;/a&gt;.) But in recent decades, the ticksâ€™ range has expanded. Lyme is now &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/data-research/facts-stats/lyme-disease-case-map.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;pervasive in the northeastern US&lt;/a&gt;, with large numbers of cases detected as far west as Minnesota and as far south as Virginia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Todayâ€™s newsletter explains why ticks have become more widespread â€” and how to keep them from crawling all over you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Two factors have combined to produce ideal conditions for more Lyme-causing ticks to come into contact with more humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;One is global warming. Climate change has kept the Northeast hotter and more humid for longer on average, stretching the ticksâ€™ active season from early spring into the late summer or early fall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;â€œWhen I was starting to work on this back in the 1970s, 1980s, we really didnâ€™t see new cases until May,â€� said Dr. Allen Steere, a rheumatologist at Harvard Medical School who was among &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2019/08/22/lyme-disease-how-discovered-and-where-from-here/KVovTbvJsJ8HIhx4K7yYQI/story.html?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2019/08/22/lyme-disease-how-discovered-and-where-from-here/KVovTbvJsJ8HIhx4K7yYQI/story.html?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;the first researchers to study Lyme&lt;/a&gt;. Today, infections in the northeast typically start rising in March. Adi Shah, who treats patients with severe Lyme at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, told me heâ€™s seen cases in November or December.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The deer tickâ€™s moniker suggests the second factor behind its proliferation. Less hunting and fewer natural predators have caused New Englandâ€™s population of white-tailed deer â€” on whose backs the ticks breed â€” &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/12/27/data/massachusetts-deer-population/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/12/27/data/massachusetts-deer-population/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter "&gt;to skyrocket&lt;/a&gt;. â€œEvery deer represents, basically, a dating site,â€� said Stephen Rich, a microbiologist at UMass Amherst. One deer can feed up to a thousand ticks, each of which can lay up to 4,000 eggs, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Suburban sprawl, lawns that abut woods, and gardens with plants that deer see as tasty snacks have also invited more of them into spaces that humans frequent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Thereâ€™s one surefire way to avoid getting Lyme: â€œDonâ€™t get bitten,â€� says Thomas Mather, a University of Rhode Island tick expert.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Chemicals can lessen the chances. Rich, the UMass microbiologist, suggests getting your property treated with &lt;a href="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/prevention/protect-your-yard/perimeter-treatments/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/prevention/protect-your-yard/perimeter-treatments/"&gt;bifenthrin, an insecticide&lt;/a&gt;. If you live in a tick-infested area, Mather says, spray your clothes and shoes with permethrin, another chemical, once a month. If youâ€˜re traveling to a Lyme hotspot, apply a repellant like DEET every few hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There are sartorial solutions, too. If hiking, wear long pants and sleeves, tuck in your shirt, and tuck your pants inside your socks. Tight-fitting clothes, like leggings, offer ticks fewer points of entry. Shower after you come inside and do a tick check. â€œThey tend to get in the areas where your body forms a Y,â€� Rich said, like leg and arm joints.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And donâ€™t forget about your pets! Ticks like to burrow behind dogsâ€™ and catsâ€™ ears and beneath their collars. If yours spend time outside, check them regularly and keep them up to date with flea and tick prevention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Suppose you spot a tick on you. What then? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Finding one crawling on you may be creepy, but good news: it probably hasnâ€™t bitten you yet. If it has, use tweezers to grasp the tick close to your skin &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/after-a-tick-bite/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/after-a-tick-bite/index.html"&gt;and pull it away gently&lt;/a&gt;, to avoid getting its mouthparts stuck in you. (Gross, I know.) Be careful not to squeeze its body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Different tick species carry different types of bacteria and viruses, so the next step if youâ€˜ve been bitten is to figure out what youâ€˜re dealing with. Consult &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alpha-gal-syndrome/in-depth/tick-species/art-20546861" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;this visual guide&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/tickspotters/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;send a photo to TickSpotters&lt;/a&gt;, Matherâ€™s program at URI, which will identify the tick for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;How long the tick has been there also matters. Ticks swell as they feed on your blood, so if you suspect it has, consider sending it to a lab &lt;a href="https://web.uri.edu/tickencounter/testing/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;that can test it for germs&lt;/a&gt;.

within a single tumor, or the differences between a primary (original) tumor and a secondary tumor," according to the National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/prostate-cancer-risk-increases-45-among-men-share-behavior" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Prostate Cancer Risk Increases By 45% Among Men Who Share One Troubling Behavior;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Prostate Cancer Risk Increases By 45% Among Men Who Share One Troubling Behavior&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the main challenges of the study was to overcome this and to identify biomarkers that were specific for prostate cancer, but also expressed in all types of patients," Smelik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Timothy Showalter, a radiation oncologist at UVA Health in Virginia and chief medical officer at Artera, was not involved in the study but commented on the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A simple, non-invasive urine test was able to detect biomarkers of prostate cancer with a high degree of accuracy, the study found.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study highlights the power of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/medical-tech" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:machine learning;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt; applied to patient data in identifying breakthroughs that can help us diagnose cancer earlier, when our treatments are most effective," he told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Prostate cancer screening has not seen a transformative advance in decades, and current approaches still rely on the PSA blood test, which is known to have low specificity for clinically significant cancers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The existing PSA test works by monitoring levels of prostate-specific antigen in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be used to screen for prostate cancer or monitor the disease’s progression, but some risks and limitations have been noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew C. Abramowitz, M.D., co-chair and clinical lead of the Genitourinary Malignancies Site Disease Group at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center in Miami, Florida, echoed the need for alternatives to the PSA test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While PSA is an incredibly sensitive tool for issues related to the prostate, it is not specific to prostate cancer," Abramowitz, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The techniques proposed in the current study suggest the promise of identifying specific cancer markers in the urine, minimizing some of the specificity concerns associated with PSA."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While PSA has the advantage of simplicity, quickness and reasonable cost, determining the meaning behind any abnormal findings often requires further testing, such as MRIs and biopsies, the doctor noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The existing PSA test works by monitoring levels of prostate-specific antigen in the blood, but some risks and limitations have been noted.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;False positives are also common with the PSA test, occurring in about 6% to 7% of the cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Only about &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/mens-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:25% of men;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;25% of men&lt;/a&gt; who have a biopsy due to an elevated PSA level are found to have prostate cancer," states the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study did have some limitations, chiefly the low number of samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The urine prostate cancer prediction model was performed on a small data set and appears to be largely an analysis of European men, both of which may limit its applicability to other high-risk prostate cancer populations," Abramowitz noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test could also come with a significant cost increase due to the specialized equipment necessary to perform the analyses, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledged the need for larger studies to validate the findings and to potentially include other cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;This work may pave the way for more specific screening methods that improve our ability to detect high-grade cancers before they progress or metastasize, ultimately improving cure rates and reducing treatment-related morbidity."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While this study was focused specifically on prostate cancer, we believe that some of the methods could be generalized to other cancers as well, which we would like to try in our future studies," Smelik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal, according to the researchers, is to achieve more efficient screening programs within the next few years, potentially helping to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/cancer-research" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:prevent and treat prostate cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;prevent and treat prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showalter agreed, adding, "This work may pave the way for more specific screening methods that improve our ability to detect high-grade cancers before they progress or metastasize, ultimately improving cure rates and reducing &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:treatment-related;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;treatment-related&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other key lifestyle changes include quitting smoking, cutting back on alcohol, and regular cholesterol checks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's also important to exercise more to help lower cholesterol levels; the health body advises everybody to do at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This could be broken down into daily brisk walks, cycling, or swimming – any movement that feels like a workout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Try a few different exercises to find something you like doing," the NHS says.

   &lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-personalisation" class="checktheseout2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;p&gt;"When you eat as much fibre as we do, you can get gassy. We walked, cue the farts, and the legendary fart walk was born,” she wrote on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, doctors say this light post-meal activity could be one of the simplest ways to support gut health, lower blood sugar, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tim Tiutan, an internal medicine specialist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre, said that he "totally supports the fart walk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to him in an Instagram Reel, light movement after eating helps the intestines move gas along and prevents constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3119587/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Japanese researchers revealed that walking suppresses the glucose increase after a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Walking at a brisk speed for 30 minutes as soon as possible just after lunch and dinner leads to more weight loss than does walking for 30 minutes beginning one hour after a meal has been consumed," the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts also agree that timing is key. To get the most out of &lt;a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/health/story/interval-walking-boosts-heart-health-and-helps-you-reduce-weight-what-is-it-2715251-2025-04-26" target="_blank"&gt;your post-meal walk&lt;/a&gt;, start within an hour of eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you wait too long, you’ll miss the spike because it starts going up within minutes after you eat," said Dr. Christopher Damman, a gastroenterologist at the Digestive Health Center at University of Washington Medical Centre, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t require intense effort. Walking helps your bowels move and lowers your blood sugar. You don’t need to do intense workouts, just five minutes of moving can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/visualstories/health/walking-or-running-which-is-better-for-fat-loss-weight-management-exercise-229857-30-04-2025" target="_blank"&gt;walking even 5 to 15 minutes&lt;/a&gt; after a meal can reduce the typical spike in blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Yale Medicine, after you eat, your blood sugar goes up as your body starts absorbing sugars from the food. If you’ve skipped breakfast, your blood sugar can rise even more after lunch or dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, the body uses a hormone called insulin to keep blood sugar in check. But sometimes, it doesn’t make enough insulin or doesn’t respond to it properly.&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-drupal-entity"&gt;


&lt;figcaption&gt;Studies suggest that walking even 5 to 15 minutes after a meal can reduce the typical spike in blood sugar. (Photo: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="shoppingWidget_mobile"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="shoppingWidgetLSH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can lead to high blood sugar, also called hyperglycemia. If it’s not managed, it can cause serious health problems like damage to the eyes, kidneys, and heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when you add a bit of exercise, &lt;a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/wellness/story/which-walk-is-more-effective-for-weight-loss-empty-stomach-or-post-meal-stmp-2679595-2025-02-15" target="_blank"&gt;as simple as walking&lt;/a&gt;, it can immediately bring down the spiked blood sugar level and even aid in fat loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also cardiac benefits when it comes to walking after meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking after a meal can help get your heart rate up for a while, which enables healthy blood flow through the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Cancer Society recommends adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity (equal to a brisk walk, at a pace of 3 miles per hour) or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity (makes your heartbeat and breathing faster, and makes you sweat) each week, preferably spread throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "fart walk" might sound like a joke, but it’s actually a habit backed by doctors. It’s simple, free, and can help you stay healthier for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dottedimg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="authors__container"&gt;&lt;div class="authors__by"&gt;&lt;p class="authlable"&gt;Published By: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="authdetaisl"&gt;ITGD Sr Sub Editor &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="published__on"&gt;&lt;p class="authlable"&gt;Published On: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="authdetaisl"&gt;May 1, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Even moderate exposure can exacerbate pre-existing conditions, leading to higher hospitalization rates and premature mortality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Notably, about 30% of Japan's population is age 65 or older, the second-highest proportion among the world's countries and economies after Monaco, according to the &lt;a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.65UP.TO.ZS?most_recent_value_desc=true" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:World Bank;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is the relationship between fine particulate matter and aging concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As Long explained, aging populations are especially vulnerable to fine particle pollution due to weakened immune systems and declining respiratory and cardiovascular function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fine particle pollution has been linked to serious health issues, including heart attacks, strokes, respiratory disease, and early death. Because these particles are so small, they are difficult to avoid, making prevention a major challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These risks are compounded by gaps in access to medical care, especially for aging people living in rural areas. But the consequences don't stop with the elderly. Illness and early retirement among older adults can strain entire families emotionally and financially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"For some working-age seniors, PM2.5 exposure is linked to increased rates of severe illnesses, forcing many to leave the workforce earlier than planned," Long said in the &lt;a href="https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/focus/en/press/z0508_00388.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:press release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.

He joined a high-end longevity clinic for a few hundred dollars a month and began monitoring his blood panels, eating better and improving his sleep. He wanted to stay active as he aged — playing tennis, surfing, hiking and spending time with his young daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But during Mr. Provissiero’s annual physical at the longevity clinic, his physician, Dr. Darshan Shah, gave him a sobering warning. Despite his healthy habits, Mr. Provissiero’s blood sugar was nearing &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/well/blood-sugar-levels-diabetes.html" title=""&gt;prediabetic levels&lt;/a&gt;. A family history heightened his risk of developing diabetes, which can shave years off a person’s life expectancy. When a stricter diet and exercise regimen didn’t move the needle, Dr. Shah prescribed metformin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Scientists have known for decades that metformin lowers blood sugar. It’s approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat Type 2 diabetes and is also commonly prescribed for weight loss and polycystic ovary syndrome. But some doctors, including Mr. Provissiero’s, are betting this same drug can head off a number of chronic diseases before they even develop, to help otherwise healthy people live longer and better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The hope is that this is going to lead to a greater number of healthy years,” said Mr. Provissiero, who lives in Malibu, Calif. After one year on metformin, he said he feels less bloated, more energetic and more in control of his weight and blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Research on metformin’s impact on the human life span is scant. The existing research, much of which has been done on mice, is “all over the place,” showing varying effects based on the animals’ sex and species, said Rafael de Cabo, a senior investigator at the National Institute on Aging who has studied metformin in mice for over two decades. Human studies, which have largely focused on diabetes patients, turn up conflicting findings on metformin’s benefits for healthy people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Still, interest in metformin’s anti-aging potential has remained high as scientists find early but promising evidence that it could also manage or delay other conditions like &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.diabetesresearchclinicalpractice.com/article/S0168-8227(19)31471-8/abstract" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-022-04649-4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2810994" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;. “Metformin may be targeting the root cause” of several other diseases whose risks increase with age, potentially because it regulates hormones, repairs tissues and eases immune system inflammation, Dr. de Cabo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drinks we’ve heard are bad for blood sugar may actually be helpful, say dietitians.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These include unsweetened coffee and tea, milk, juice and soy milk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead, try to avoid sugary drinks like soda, sweet tea and syrupy lattes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you’re trying to manage your blood sugar, finding a drink that won’t spike your numbers can seem like a challenge. But what if we told you there are beverages you may be avoiding that are compatible with—and even advantageous for—blood sugar management? It’s true! Many of the drinks we’re often told are bad for blood sugar contain compounds that may support healthy blood sugar levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, there are some drinks that really are problematic for blood sugar. To set the record straight, we asked dietitians to weigh in on drinks that get an unfair rap for blood sugar management, plus ones to avoid. Here’s what they told us. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-coffee"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Coffee &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8037224/drinking-coffee-inflammation-diabetes-risk-research/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Coffee&lt;/a&gt; fans, we’ve got good news! “Coffee without added sweetener may actually be beneficial to blood sugar,” says &lt;a href="http://erinpalinski.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Erin Palinski-Wade, RD, CDE&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and author of &lt;em&gt;2 Day Diabetes Diet.&lt;/em&gt; “Drinking black coffee has been associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes and a slowed progression of the disease.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Palinski-Wade points to the presence of chlorogenic acids in coffee. These compounds function as antioxidants that may reduce inflammation. That’s important because unchecked inflammation can make it harder for your body to use its own insulin, impairing glucose metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And it doesn’t matter if you prefer full-test or decaf; both kinds of coffee contain chlorogenic acid. The most important thing is to make sure your coffee is unsweetened to avoid added sugars.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-dairy-milk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Dairy Milk  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dairy milk gets an unfair reputation in so many ways. Perhaps you’ve heard it promotes inflammation or that its sugars can raise blood sugar. You can relax, says Palinski-Wade. “&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031955/is-dairy-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dairy milk&lt;/a&gt; often is looked at as being bad for blood sugar due to the natural sugar (lactose) it contains,” she says. “However, this drink is balanced with protein, carbs and fats, allowing it to have a minimal impact on blood sugar.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, some research has found a correlation between increased dairy intake and a &lt;em&gt;reduced&lt;/em&gt; risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “The exact reason isn’t known, says Palinski-Wade. “However, it may be due to beneficial nutrients, including vitamin D and magnesium found in dairy, which can help to improve insulin sensitivity.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “100% fruit juice can be part of a diabetes meal plan and keep blood sugar balanced,” says Palinski-Wade. Trouble is, the natural sugar in juice frequently causes people to avoid it, even though natural sugar is very different from added sugar. How so? “Natural sugars—unlike added sugar—are generally bound in a matrix of fiber, antioxidants and other beneficial nutrients that can help blood sugar, not hurt it,” says Palinski-Wade.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re skeptical, consider the results of a recent study that found that moderate fruit juice consumption doesn’t increase the risk of type 2 diabetes or negatively impact blood sugar control.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition to fruit juice’s impressive nutrition and antioxidant profile, it has a lower glycemic index than sugar-sweetened beverages. So, it’s unlikely to flood your bloodstream with sugar the same way as soda or sweet tea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Juice can be enjoyed alone or used in recipes as a natural way to sweeten your dish,” says Palinski-Wade. “I recommend looking for juice that contains fiber naturally, such as 100% prune juice, and keeping your portion size to a half-cup at a time for blood sugar balance.” Or, pair it with a source of protein to slow the absorption of its sugars, like a handful of nuts or slice of cheese, says &lt;a href="http://www.samanthacassetty.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Samantha Cassetty, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition and wellness expert and co-author of &lt;em&gt;Sugar Shock&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are a lot of&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/myths-about-soy-you-need-to-stop-believing-11706042" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; unfounded myths about soy&lt;/a&gt;. One that you might have heard is that soy milk raises blood sugar. Is it true?  “Unsweetened soy milk is one of my go-to plant-based milks because it matches the protein in dairy milk,” says Cassetty. It’s also low in carbs, making it a healthy option when you’re managing your blood sugar, she says. In fact, 1 cup of unsweetened soy milk provides 8 grams of protein, just like dairy milk, and roughly 9 grams of carbohydrates, depending on the brand.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, soy milk’s protein can further slow down the impact of other carbs in your meal or snack. “So, if you’re having a bowl of cereal or oatmeal, serving it with soy milk can help stabilize your blood sugar,” says Cassetty.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, looking for a variety with no added sugars is key, she adds. “Sometimes plain versions contain a small amount of sweetener, so you need to read labels until you find a brand that doesn’t,” she says.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember how coffee’s chlorogenic acids do good things for blood sugar? Turns out, tea boasts its own blood sugar–friendly compounds called catechins. Research has found that catechins from both green and black tea may regulate blood sugar in multiple ways, such as improving the body’s ability to use insulin, guarding against &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and functioning as antioxidants to combat oxidative stress.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “They may also feed your good gut bacteria, which may help your body’s insulin work more effectively to clear sugar from your blood,” says Cassetty. No wonder tea is among our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-antioxidant-drinks-for-diabetes-8667246" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;top antioxidant-rich drinks for diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, when it comes to reaping tea’s benefits, the less you add, the better, says Cassetty. “Try to drink tea plain without any sweetener, whether that’s sugar or a zero-calorie sweetener,” she says.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even healthy drinks can raise blood glucose if they contain added sugar. In addition to searching the Nutrition Facts panel for added sugars, try these strategies:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retrain Your Taste Buds. &lt;/strong&gt;If your favorite beverages contain added sugars, Cassetty recommends slowly weaning yourself off them. “The real key is to get your taste buds used to drinking plain, unsweetened drinks with no added sugar and no other sweeteners,” she says. (More on this next!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swap Part of Your Sugary Drink with an Unsweetened Version. &lt;/strong&gt;This works for tea, coffee, and plant-based and flavored milks. Start with a ratio of 75% sweetened to 25% unsweetened. Then, keep adjusting until you’re favoring the unsweetened. Over time, you may not need the sweetened at all!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downsize. &lt;/strong&gt;If you’re not quite ready to say goodbye to your sugar-sweetened coffee or tea habit, switch to a smaller cup. It’s a small change that can help until you’re ready to make the move to unsweetened versions.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the Caffeine&lt;/strong&gt;. Some people can experience an increase in blood sugar levels when they consume large amounts of caffeine. If you notice that caffeine makes your numbers spike, switch to decaf or a half-caf blend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to what to drink for better blood sugar, there’s a lot of confusion and misinformation! The truth is, many drinks you might have heard are bad for your blood sugar (and that you may be avoiding!) may help with blood sugar management. According to dietitians, unsweetened coffee and tea, dairy milk, 100% fruit juice and soy milk can all be part of a blood sugar–friendly diet. Ideally, the goal is to aim for drinks that are free of added sugars. However, if you’re not ready to say goodbye to sugar entirely, think baby steps. By slowly weaning yourself off of sugar-sweetened drinks, you can retrain your taste buds over time.&lt;br&gt;
