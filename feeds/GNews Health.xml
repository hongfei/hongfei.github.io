&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The latest health craze to hit social media: magnesium lotion.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Magnesium is an essential mineral that the body uses for a number of functions. It has long been thought to help with sleep when taken as an oral supplement, though there is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/08/05/nx-s1-5060416/sleep-magnesium-supplements" target="_blank"&gt;little scientific evidence&lt;/a&gt; to back up that claim. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Influencers now promote magnesium in lotion form as an elixir for improving sleep as well as for addressing a wide range of problems, including cortisol and insulin imbalance, muscle soreness, fibromyalgia and arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Did you know rubbing magnesium cream on your child's feet can help with sleep?" asks one woman on TikTok who goes by cottagecalderon and who promises that it can help with growing pains and improving mood.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"No midnight leg cramps," says a man on the account tap.the.orange.cart. "It works for me and my wife."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Y'all," says another TikTokker, well over 40ish, "this magnesium lotion and spray is magic in the bottle."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The claim &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Enthusiasts claim that magnesium lotion — specifically applied to feet — can improve sleep. Many also argue it can be applied all over the body to remedy a variety of other health ailments.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People are buying the idea, literally. &lt;a href="https://growthmarketreports.com/report/topical-magnesium-creams-market" target="_blank"&gt;One market research group&lt;/a&gt; estimated the market in 2024 for topical magnesium was more than $400 million.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The evidence &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There is little proof that magnesium can be absorbed through the skin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The problem with this is that the skin is a barrier, not a sponge," says &lt;a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/162855" target="_blank"&gt;Nicholas Theodosakis&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatologist and researcher at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most medications are best delivered orally, which allows for quick absorption into the bloodstream. A few kinds of substances are well suited to absorption through the skin, he says. Often, transdermal patches are used for medications that need to be slowly absorbed over time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's no evidence that magnesium is in this category.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Theodosakis theorizes that any benefits realized from magnesium lotion are likely from the massage used to apply it or the lotion's moisturizing ingredients. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;" You apply a cream or a lotion or an ointment that contains some active ingredient and, yeah, your skin looks better than maybe some place you didn't apply it," says Theodosakis. "But that's because the cream itself promotes skin health. Anything that comes in like a cream base or an ointment base is just automatically gonna be good for the skin."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The nuance&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of evidence, at least one doctor says if magnesium lotion is working for you — go for it. "I think the risks of applying magnesium to your skin are probably extremely small," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://sleep.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/john-winkelman" target="_blank"&gt;John Winkelman&lt;/a&gt;, a sleep expert at Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says he had at least one patient report using "magnesium butter," for sleep. (" I thought you put that on toast, but no, in fact, you rub it on your legs," says Winkelman.) "She did say magnesium butter was helping."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Winkelman says in matters of sleep especially, placebo can be powerful — and he's not one to discourage whatever safe remedies work for his patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That said, Winkelman is not planning to recommend it anytime soon. Supplements and related products are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, which leaves consumers vulnerable to buying the lotion without knowing exactly what's in it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For some of the sleep conditions that magnesium lotion supposedly treats, says Winkelman, there are medically proven treatments. Restless legs syndrome, for example — something some influencers say is eased with an application of magnesium lotion — has actual tested medical therapies. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I really don't feel that it's fair to recommend things that I really don't think have been substantiated as effective," says Winkelman. "I'm a big believer in scientific evidence."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Though there is no proof that magnesium lotion promotes sleep or addresses medical problems, experts, including dermatologist Nicholas Theodosakis, agree that magnesium lotion likely won't hurt, except, he says, "in the pocketbook."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;He notes that as a dermatologist, he sees many health fads. "I think it's just the nature of skin," he notes. "It's highly linked to emotional well-being and psychology and culture. Also, you just have quite a lot of it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

However, the solution might be as simple as using special eye drops two or three times a day.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A retrospective study of 766 patients presented on September 14 at the 43&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Congress of the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ESCRS) [1], found that the majority could read an extra two, three or more lines on the eye chart used for testing near visual acuity (the Jaeger chart) after using specially formulated eye drops. This improvement was sustained for up to two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Giovanna Benozzi, director of the Center for Advanced Research for Presbyopia, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, said: "We conducted this research due to the significant unmet medical need in presbyopia management. Current solutions such as reading glasses or surgical interventions have limitations, including inconvenience, social discomfort, and potential risks or complications. There is a group of presbyopia patients who have limited options besides spectacles, and who are not candidates for surgery; these are our primary focus of interest. We sought to provide robust clinical evidence supporting an innovative pharmacological solution to offer patients a non-invasive, convenient and effective alternative."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eye drops, developed by Dr Benozzi's father, the late Dr Jorge Benozzi of the same centre, contain a combination of two active agents: pilocarpine, a drug that constricts the pupils and contracts the ciliary muscle, which is a muscle controlling the eye's accommodation for seeing objects at varying distances, and diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces inflammation and the discomfort that pilocarpine often causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients administered the eye drops twice a day, usually on waking and again approximately six hours later, with an optional third dose if symptoms recurred or additional visual comfort was needed. The group of patients (373 women and 393 men, with an average age of 55) were divided into three groups to receive one of three eye drop formulations. Each formulation had a fixed dose of diclofenac but concentrations of pilocarpine were 1%, 2% and 3%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers assessed the improvement in how well patients could read the Jaeger chart without reading glasses (uncorrected near visual acuity) one hour after the first administration of the drops, and they followed up the patients for two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Benozzi told the Congress: "Our most significant result showed rapid and sustained improvements in near vision for all three concentrations. One hour after having the first drops, patients had an average improvement of 3.45 Jaeger lines. The treatment also improved focus at all distances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Impressively, 99% of 148 patients in the 1% pilocarpine group reached optimal near vision and were able to read two or more extra lines. Approximately 83% of all patients maintained good functional near vision at 12 months. Importantly, no significant adverse events like increased intraocular pressure or retinal detachment were observed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2% group, 69% of 248 patients were able to read three or more extra lines on the Jaeger chart, and in the 3% group, 84% of 370 patients could read three or more extra lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The improvement in the patients' vision was sustained for up to two years, with a median duration of 434 days. Adverse side effects were mild, with the most common being temporary dim vision, which occurred in 32% of cases, irritation when the drops were instilled (3.7%) and headache (3.8%). No patients discontinued the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common adverse side effects of pilocarpine can also include eye redness, watery eyes, blurred vision, dim or dark vision, sensitivity to light or problems changing focus between objects, seeing flashes of light or "floaters" in vision, and, in rare cases, detached retinas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Benozzi continued: "Nearly all patients experienced positive improvements in near visual acuity, although the magnitude of the improvement depended on the status of their vision before treatment at baseline. Our study revealed that optimal pilocarpine concentrations could be individualized depending on the baseline severity of presbyopia as assessed by the initial Jaeger scores. Patients with less severe presbyopia responded best to 1% concentrations, while those with more advanced presbyopia required higher 2% or 3% concentrations to achieve significant visual improvement."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She concluded: "These results suggest this combination therapy offers a safe, effective, and well-tolerated alternative to traditional presbyopia management. It significantly reduces dependence on reading glasses, providing a convenient, non-invasive option for patients, although these eye drops may not eliminate the need for glasses in all individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Importantly, this treatment is not intended to replace surgical interventions, but rather to serve as a valuable solution for patients who need safe, effective, and personalised alternatives and seek freedom from the inconvenience of eyewear. Eye care professionals now have an evidence-based pharmacological option that expands the spectrum of presbyopia care beyond glasses and surgery."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the group of patients in this study, Dr Benozzi has other patients who have received the treatment for more than ten years. Dr Benozzi plans further research to measure improvements in patients' quality of life, and to explore the underlying physiological mechanisms of the eye drops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strengths of the study include the large number of patients included and the long follow-up time. It is the first systematic evaluation comparing three different pilocarpine concentrations in combination with diclofenac. A limitation is that it is a retrospective, single-centre study, which could limit the generalizability of the findings and introduce selection bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESCRS President-Elect, Professor Burkhard Dick, chair of the ophthalmology department at the University Eye Hospital Bochum, Germany, was not involved in the research. He commented: "While surgery for age-related near vision loss has advanced, some patients are not candidates. The single-centre retrospective study by Dr Benozzi suggests that eye drops containing pilocarpine and diclofenac may improve near vision for up to two years, but the limited design means the results may not apply to everyone. Long-term pilocarpine use can sometimes cause side effects such as reduced night vision, dimmer vision in low light, eye strain, irritation and, in rare cases, retinal detachment, while prolonged topical NSAID use may pose corneal risks. Broader, long-term, multi-centre studies are needed to confirm safety and effectiveness before this treatment can be widely recommended."&lt;/p&gt;

Still, he emphasized that for many people, the benefits are likely to outweigh the risks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Turmeric&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turmeric is rich in the active compound curcumin, which has anti-inflammatory and &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-calls-matcha-tea-science-in-a-cup-shares-top-5-benefits-fat-burn-antioxidant-weight-loss-caffeine-101752815578622.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="antioxidant"&gt;antioxidant &lt;/a&gt;properties, according to Dr Sood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sood states that the whole body has &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/vitamin-d3-supplements-vegan-options-for-stronger-immunity-and-active-lifestyle-101757418357652.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="vitamin D"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; receptors, including the nervous system. He continues, “Some research suggests that vitamin D may play a role in regulating pain perception and nerve function, improving quality of life in chronic pain patients.” The doctor also mentions that vitamin D can be beneficial for bone health and reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ashwagandha&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress and anxiety is believed to aggravate chronic pain.

			&lt;p&gt;The link between  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="174214" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and dementia is becoming increasingly clear. New research shows how blood sugar problems affect brain health and vice versa. Here are ten evidence-based insights into how the two conditions are related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Diabetes raises the risk of dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with diabetes are about &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4722942/"&gt;60% more likely&lt;/a&gt; to develop dementia than those without, and frequent episodes of low blood sugar are linked to a 50% higher chance of cognitive &lt;a href="https://dmsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13098-024-01346-4"&gt;decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Insulin resistance affects the brain too&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insulin resistance – the major cause of type 2 diabetes – happens when cells stop responding properly to insulin. This means that too much sugar, in the form of glucose, is left in the blood, leading to complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-signal-of-dementia-could-be-hidden-in-how-we-read-faces"&gt;An Early Signal of Dementia Could Be Hidden in How We Read Faces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It usually affects the liver and muscles, but it also affects the brain. In  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="174214" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, this resistance may make it harder for brain cells to use glucose for energy, contributing to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4351418/"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. A brain sugar shortage in dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain is only 2% of our body weight, but uses about 20% of the body's energy. In dementia, brain cells appear to lose the ability to use glucose &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7948516/"&gt;properly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mix of poor use of glucose and insulin resistance is sometimes unofficially called &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/dementia-information/dementia-risk/diabetes-and-dementia-risk/"&gt;type 3 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174225" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174225" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Woman-with-Diabetes-Wearing-a-CGM-Device-on-Her-Arm-Reading-a-Book.jpg" alt="Woman with Diabetes Wearing a CGM Device on Her Arm Reading a Book" class="size-full wp-image-174225" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Woman-with-Diabetes-Wearing-a-CGM-Device-on-Her-Arm-Reading-a-Book.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Woman-with-Diabetes-Wearing-a-CGM-Device-on-Her-Arm-Reading-a-Book-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Woman-with-Diabetes-Wearing-a-CGM-Device-on-Her-Arm-Reading-a-Book-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174225" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Frequent episodes of low blood sugar are linked to a 50% higher chance of cognitive decline.

Alzheimer's can raise diabetes risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with Alzheimer's often have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2993007/#abstract1"&gt;higher fasting blood glucose&lt;/a&gt;, even if they don't have diabetes. This is a form of pre-diabetes. Animal studies also show that Alzheimer's-like changes in the brain &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-016-3960-1"&gt;raise blood glucose levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the highest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's, the &lt;em&gt;APOE4&lt;/em&gt; genetic variant, reduces insulin sensitivity by &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/references/S0896-6273(17)30791-2"&gt;trapping the insulin receptor inside the cell&lt;/a&gt;, where it cannot be switched on properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Blood vessel damage links both conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes damages blood vessels, causing complications in the eyes, kidneys and heart. The brain is also at risk. High or varying blood glucose levels can injure vessels in the brain, reducing blood flow and oxygen delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes can also weaken the brain's protective barrier, letting harmful substances in. This leads to inflammation. Reduced blood flow and brain inflammation are strongly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6571853/"&gt;linked to dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Memantine: a dementia drug born from diabetes research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memantine, used to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer's symptoms, was originally developed as a diabetes medication. It didn't succeed in controlling blood glucose, but researchers later discovered its benefits for &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1517/14656566.2011.558006"&gt;brain function&lt;/a&gt;. This story shows how diabetes research may hold clues for treating brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Metformin might protect the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metformin, the most widely used diabetes drug, does more than just lower blood glucose. It gets into the brain and may &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40710317/"&gt;lower brain inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest that people with diabetes who take metformin are less likely to develop dementia, and those who stop taking it may see their &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2810994"&gt;risk increase again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trials are testing its effects in people &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40434891/"&gt;without diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Weight-loss injections may reduce plaque buildup&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs, such as semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy), lower blood glucose and support weight loss. Records show that people with diabetes on these drugs have a lower dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing GLP-1 drugs to metformin, studies have found that they were even &lt;a href="https://drc.bmj.com/content/13/4/e004902"&gt;more effective than metformin&lt;/a&gt; at reducing dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two major trials, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39780249/"&gt;Evoke and Evoke Plus&lt;/a&gt;, are testing oral semaglutide in people with mild cognitive impairment or early mild Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174227" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174227" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Persons-Hands-Preparing-Semaglutide-Ozempic-Injection.jpg" alt="Person's Hands Preparing Semaglutide Injection" class="size-full wp-image-174227" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Persons-Hands-Preparing-Semaglutide-Ozempic-Injection.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Persons-Hands-Preparing-Semaglutide-Ozempic-Injection-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/Persons-Hands-Preparing-Semaglutide-Ozempic-Injection-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174227" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;People with diabetes on GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs have a lower dementia risk. (imyskin/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Insulin therapy might help the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since insulin resistance in the brain is a problem, researchers have tested insulin sprays given through the nose. This method delivers insulin straight to the brain while reducing effects on blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small studies suggest these sprays &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/1107947"&gt;may help memory&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34101779/"&gt;reduce brain shrinkage&lt;/a&gt;, but delivery methods remain a challenge. Sprays vary in how much insulin reaches the brain, and long-term safety has not yet been proven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10. SGLT2 inhibitors may lower dementia risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;New evidence suggests that compared to GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, (a type of diabetes drug) are superior at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1262363625000187"&gt;reducing dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;, including Alzheimer's and vascular dementia, in people with type 2 diabetes. These tablets lower blood sugar by increasing sugar removal in urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study builds on early evidence suggesting they lower dementia risk by &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209805"&gt;reducing inflammation in the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This growing body of evidence suggests that managing diabetes protects more than the heart and kidneys, it also helps preserve brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions remain whether diabetes drugs only reduce the diabetes-associated dementia risk or whether these drugs could also reduce risk in people without diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, diabetes research has been very successful in creating at least 13 different classes of drugs, multiple combination therapies, giving rise to at least 50 different medicines. These reduce blood sugar, improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 'side effect' may be better preservation of brain health during ageing.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264393/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Whether you’re catching up on messages, watching videos, reading the news, or just passing the time, the bathroom ritual often doubles as a digital break, as the toilet becomes a mini escape from the world. On the surface, it feels harmless – a few extra minutes here and there. But emerging research suggests this convenience could carry hidden risks to health – especially in the digestive, anal, and pelvic areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in PLOS One by researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston found that adults who use smartphones on the toilet have a 46% higher risk of hemorrhoids than those who don’t. Why? Because using a phone tends to prolong the time spent on the toilet, it increases pressure in the rectal veins. That alone may explain much of the risk. What drives this risk? Mainly, increased time sitting on the toilet (especially more than 5 minutes per visit), more pressure on anal and rectal veins, reduced physical activity, and distraction leading to poor habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s just one of several problems being connected to this modern bathroom behaviour. From infections to pelvic damage, posture issues to digestive trouble, using your phone during bathroom visits might be doing more harm than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we explore seven specific health conditions or risks linked with phone use on the toilet. We discuss what recent studies show, how each condition develops, and simple changes you can make to avoid becoming vulnerable. Even if you don’t bring your phone into the bathroom, some of these risks apply to prolonged sitting. Learning these can help you make smarter choices about when and how to use your phone — especially in your most private moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following are several health conditions that are (or may be) linked to this particular bathroom habit, how the phone-on-toilet behavior contributes, and what you can do to reduce the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 01:12:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>澳大利亚批准接种疫苗以保护考拉免受衣原体感染- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/09/14/nx-s1-5541358/australia-koala-chlamydia-vaccine</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A vaccine has been approved to help protect koalas against chlamydia, a measure researchers are hailing as a world-first in fighting the disease that is a leading cause of death for the beloved marsupials.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of the Sunshine Coast (UniSC) in Australia said Wednesday it took more than 10 years to develop a single-dose vaccine that does not require a booster that it hopes will aid in "reducing the rapid, devastating spread of this disease."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Some individual colonies are edging closer to local extinction every day, particularly in South East Queensland and New South Wales, where infection rates within populations are often around 50 percent and in some cases can reach as high as 70 percent," Peter Timms, a microbiology professor at the university who led the research team, &lt;a href="https://www.usc.edu.au/about/unisc-news/news-archive/2025/september/world-first-unisc-s-koala-vaccine-approved-to-fight-deadly-disease" target="_blank"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Chlamydia in koalas can cause blindness and lead them to starve to death because they cannot locate trees to climb for food, &lt;a href="https://koalaconservationaustralia.org.au/pages/disease" target="_blank"&gt;according to Koala Conservation Australia&lt;/a&gt;. It can also cause infertility and damage a koala's bladder to the point where the inner wall becomes inflamed and the marsupial passes blood, the organization said. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The disease occurs in koalas multiple ways, including through mating, infected discharges and at birth. Baby koalas, known as joeys, can also catch chlamydia by eating pap, a substance produced by a mother that's similar to feces, if their mother is infected.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Antibiotics have been used to treat the disease but it is not always effective and does not prevent future infections, according to the university. Antibiotics can also lead to gastrointestinal side effects that could hinder koalas' ability to digest eucalyptus leaves, which are the animals' main food source. Depending on the severity of the chlamydia and if it has progressed too far, euthanasia may be an only option.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's why scientists are optimistic about the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sam Phillips, a senior researcher at the UniSC, said the vaccine has been tested on hundreds of wild koalas and koalas in captivity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's based on Chlamydia pecorum's major outer membrane protein (MOMP), and offers three levels of protection – reducing infection, preventing progression to clinical disease and, in some cases, reversing existing symptoms," Phillips said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The study led by Phillips &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-024-00938-5" target="_blank"&gt;that published last year&lt;/a&gt; found that the vaccine reduced signs of chlamydia during a koala's breeding age and decreased death from the disease by 64%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The university said the vaccine has been approved for production and widespread use by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The agency told NPR it approved a permit authorizing use of the vaccine in koalas in June that runs through June 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

They were heading into deep water and coming back with big, fast fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organic boats and ropes usually rot away, so direct proof is rare. What survives are tools, fish bones, and clues in microscopic wear on stone edges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riczar Fuentes of &lt;a href="https://www.ateneo.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ateneo de Manila University&lt;/a&gt; and his colleagues focus on what stone tools reveal about plant processing and boat work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their approach links tool wear and plant fibers to practical needs like rope, nets, and bindings for watercraft and in a recent publication, they argued that a web of indirect signs can confirm real maritime skill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The identification of boat building materials through direct or indirect evidence is vital in understanding movements across and within island environments,” wrote Fuentes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same stone tools carry tiny traces that point to fiber extraction. Those fibers become cordage, lines, and netting strong enough for boat seams and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/one-third-of-shark-species-face-extinction-despite-fishing-bans/"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; gear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of tracing work has a name. Researchers call it traceology, a method that reads microscopic wear to reconstruct how a tool was used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-seafaring-this-early-matters"&gt;Why seafaring this early matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crossing channels between islands takes planning, timing, and control. Drifting on rafts would not explain repeated arrivals in specific places over long spans of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The region in question is Island Southeast Asia, a sprawl of land and sea that demanded reliable water travel. Within it sits Wallacea, the chain of islands between Asia and Australia that always required open-water crossings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists now think people here were more than lucky passengers on currents. The tool evidence suggests deliberate building, organized labor, and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of know-how changes how we picture daily life. It also explains how communities kept moving, trading, and adapting across thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hooks-sharks-and-tuna-at-jerimalai"&gt;Hooks, sharks, and tuna at Jerimalai&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Here we report remains of a variety of pelagic and other fish species dating to 42,000 years before the present,” wrote Sue O’Connor from Australian National University, in a &lt;a href="https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstreams/395b3624-7aba-44e8-ae54-08a923e67615/download"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; describing the fish record and early gear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same study documents the earliest known shell fishhooks at Jerimalai, a rock shelter on Timor-Leste’s coast dated between about 23,000 and 16,000 years ago. These are small, precise tools that speak to careful crafting and targeted fishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bone counts are not trivial. The team identified 38,687 fish bones from 2,843 individual fish. Crucially, the assemblage includes remains of pelagic species that live in deeper water beyond reefs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-timor-to-the-philippines"&gt;From Timor to the Philippines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timor-Leste is only part of the picture. A broad record from the Philippines now shows long-term &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ice-age-art-discovery-reveals-15800-year-old-fishing-secrets/"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; that spans at least 30,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352409X23003978"&gt;Work&lt;/a&gt; in Mindoro’s caves adds detail on how coastal people managed reefs and deeper zones. That study tracked which fish families show up, and when, across changing shorelines and habitats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These finds tie into plant fibers and tool wear in the same region. The combined record points to people who planned, built, and fished with skill, not luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patterns like these do not appear once and vanish. They persist, which suggests teaching, apprenticeship, and shared practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-boats-came-together"&gt;How boats came together&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood planks, sewn edges, and lashings would have relied on sturdy plant fibers. The tool traces match steps needed to strip, twist, and finish those fibers into ropes and lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-61839-w"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that making string is not a recent trick, citing evidence that short fibres fragment from Abri du Maras in France records twisted plant strands more than 40,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This does not mean people in Europe and Southeast Asia did the same thing in the same way. It shows that fiber technology was within the reach of human hands and minds wherever materials allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If people could twist string, they could weave nets, lash boat parts, and make lines. That opens the door to deep-water travel and targeted fishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rethinking-migration-across-islands"&gt;Rethinking migration across islands&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obsidian moving between islands in southeastern Indonesia and Timor-Leste points to sustained contact. The &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305440316301613"&gt;pattern&lt;/a&gt; fits a late Pleistocene to early Holocene interaction zone rather than one-off drifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stone does not sail itself, and it does not walk across channels. Its movement reflects planned trips, return journeys, and social ties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those ties likely included sharing routes and seasons. You do not reach a tuna run by guessing, you reach it by knowledge passed along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As knowledge spreads, technology improves. Better ropes, better lines, and better boats raise the odds of a safe return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-changes-the-story-we-tell"&gt;Why this changes the story we tell&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, scholars looked for the earliest big changes in a few famous regions. These finds push us to broaden the map and timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, technical skill is not just tool design, it is teamwork. People needed group effort to build, carry, launch, and maintain boats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not teamwork alone, it is also about logistics. Fibers must be harvested, processed, and stored, and repairs must be made fast when seawater and sun wear things down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-fish-bones-reveal-clues-about-the-evolution-of-eating/"&gt;fish bones&lt;/a&gt;, the hooks, and the traces on stone tools point to a culture that understood the sea. The work looks careful, repeatable, and tied to seasons and migrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-remains-to-figure-out"&gt;What remains to figure out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boats do not preserve well, so many details will stay hidden. Even so, the indirect signs add up and form a consistent picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future experiments can test which plants, tools, and fiber twists hold up under load. Those trials can feed back into the archaeological read on use wear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More underwater and coastal work could reveal net weights, sinkers, or preserved cord in unusual conditions. Every new fragment can lock one more piece into place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all of this, one message stands firm. People in Island Southeast Asia were organized and capable on the water far earlier than many assumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352409X25000525?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 23:12:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNQXc3YUU5VVpxSy1nck9id0ZMRmVNM1NoZzZQN0ppRkU5cDRjYlRLSDY1d1BXQ00tNExkU2lVVDlnSjFyYjZ0NDZzak9Ra3JyOFIxWFZEYzhXOWYxSHFYeTZZLVFJQ0FJSGt0SWN5NHZZVUZWdHdKSEJULXZXa0FCV3ZVVkhwbUV5dDN6Z1JTMk9LTDdmQzJmeDhMZkliVlNWd1ZmU2F3SUMtZw</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，癌症如何在激素的帮助下欺骗免疫系统- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-tricks-the-immune-system-with-the-help-of-hormone-scg2/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer sometimes gets the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/daylight-boosts-the-immune-systems-ability-to-fight-infections/"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; to back off. A new study shows that a natural signal, a hormone, can tell certain white blood cells to slow down, which lets tumors grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding points to a fresh target for treatment. It also helps explain why powerful cancer drugs work well for some people but not for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-study-matters"&gt;Why this study matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was co-led by Cheng Cheng “Alec” Zhang, Ph.D., Professor of Physiology at &lt;a href="https://utswmed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UT Southwestern Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across common cancers like lung, kidney, and melanoma, only about 20 to 30 percent of patients benefit from these drugs called &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s12276-018-0130-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;immune checkpoint inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; – medicines that remove natural brakes on T-cells so those cells attack tumors more strongly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They help many people but not all. That leaves a lot of patients needing new options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many tumors build up cells from a group called &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-021-00670-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;myeloid cells&lt;/a&gt;, early responder white blood cells that usually help start immune defense. These cells can turn suppressive in cancer and hold back T-cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer also changes the immune system beyond the tumor site. That broader shift matters for whether treatments work, a 2021 review explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-study-focuses-on-scg2"&gt;Study focuses on SCG2&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team focused on &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;secretogranin 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(SCG2) which acts like a hormone – a chemical messenger that cells release to send signals through the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discovered that SCG2 latches onto &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/11006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;LILRB4&lt;/a&gt;, a receptor, which is a docking site on the surface of certain myeloid cells that catches a signal like a hormone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When SCG2 binds LILRB4, it tells those cells to ease off their tumor fighting jobs. It also interferes with the call for backup from T-cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside these cells, the signal turns on &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/stat3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;STAT3&lt;/a&gt;, a protein that switches many genes on or off. When STAT3 is active in myeloid cells, those cells tend to suppress other immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a one two punch. The early responders stop helping, and the later responders do not get to the tumor in normal numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-tests-were-done"&gt;How the tests were done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers first confirmed the SCG2 to LILRB4 match in dishes of cells. They showed that the binding turned down myeloid cell activity that would otherwise help fight tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then used mice whose myeloid cells carried the human form of LILRB4. Tumors that produced SCG2 grew faster in those mice, while blocking LILRB4 slowed growth, and removing SCG2 also slowed growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also showed that the growth boost from SCG2 depended on T-cells. When T-cells were taken out of the picture, the advantage went away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Myeloid cells are among the first group of immune cells recruited to tumors, but very quickly these tumor-fighting cells turn into tumor-supporting cells. Our study suggests that receptors on these myeloid cells get stimulated by this &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/oxytocin-cuddle-hormone-fosters-love-boosts-memory-and-may-cure-addiction/"&gt;hormone&lt;/a&gt; and end up suppressing the immune system,” said Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-it-could-mean-for-care"&gt;What it could mean for care&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking LILRB4 could become a new way to help more patients respond to treatment. It makes sense to test LILRB4 blockers with existing checkpoint drugs in careful trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is early support for targeting this receptor from other diseases. In multiple &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/walking-each-day-at-any-speed-lowers-the-risk-of-cancer/"&gt;myeloma&lt;/a&gt;, blocking LILRB4 slowed disease growth in lab and animal tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pathway also leans on STAT3, which is a central control switch in these suppressive cells. A 2025 review notes that STAT3 helps these cells grow and shut down T-cells, so pairing a LILRB4 blocker with a STAT3 focused drug might be useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another angle too. Because SCG2 can quiet myeloid cells, carefully adding SCG2 might one day help calm certain inflammatory conditions that run too hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-questions-people-may-ask"&gt;Questions people may ask&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can doctors measure SCG2 in blood or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/computer-model-can-identify-tumor-fighting-immune-cells/"&gt;tumor&lt;/a&gt; tissue to guide care. That will require tests that are accurate and easy to run in clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will blocking LILRB4 cause infections or other issues since the receptor helps keep inflammation in check. Safety will need close monitoring in early trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could tumors switch to a different signal if LILRB4 is blocked. Cancers often adapt, so combinations may be important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would doctors choose who gets a LILRB4 blocker. Matching the drug to tumors that use the SCG2 to LILRB4 route will likely matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-research-goes-next"&gt;Where research goes next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build a reliable test for SCG2 levels and LILRB4 activity. Use it to pick patients who are most likely to benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run trials that add LILRB4 blockers to checkpoint therapy. Track whether more patients respond and how long responses last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Map this pathway in different &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/pfas-forever-chemicals-in-tap-water-linked-to-33-percent-increase-in-cancer-rates/"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt; and in human samples over time. Learn when the pathway turns on and how best to shut it off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study whether carefully giving SCG2 can help dial down harmful inflammation in certain diseases. Keep a close eye on side effects while doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-025-02233-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Immunology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 22:52:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxPbTVhX3gxcEVVQ0ZSM3NpWGNjTzRLRDRXWERJM0NLTXdfMFZWam8zZVdKWG1uNTFHUnoxN1BITkJGWWQ0dnRzb3YzNFRPMTFjUFVmNzZLZGdSZllISnZScGZqeWJuMHptUmVpOHA3TjNqYVNtTVd0NG1sWTZnMThDTGw0elcyTms5Q2gwd1hsUDF4UlE</guid></item><item><title>三倍剂量的诺和诺德药物在试验中实现了19%的体重减轻-英国《金融时报》</title><link>https://www.ft.com/content/581ef56d-8f25-4f04-8386-74d35de0d755</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="o-grid-row details-section o3-type-body-base css-pmzbjb"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;FT newspaper delivered Monday-Saturday, plus FT Digital Edition delivered to your device Monday-Saturday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Financial Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 22:30:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE05Q3BfeTR0MlRIclRta3pud3RFV29fSnhNQ3dlUEJ6X3lhU1ZrSUpPeXRLNzA1SXkyckxCTXNIUG12dzFtQl9JWEdiN1NSdWJ3Y0hleFAwdkRjc2t2eFpzaUhsWk1WN3pHWDJXNEhOaXo</guid></item><item><title>临床试验证实，较高剂量的semaglutide可以安全地增强肥胖成人的减肥效果- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-higher-doses-semaglutide-safely-weight.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A higher weekly dose of semaglutide (7.2 mg) can significantly improve weight loss and related health outcomes in adults living with obesity, including those with type 2 diabetes (T2D), according to the results of two large-scale, international phase 3 clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet Diabetes &amp;amp; Endocrinology&lt;/i&gt; journal, suggest that a higher dose of semaglutide offers a promising new option for people with obesity, including those with T2D, who have not achieved sufficient weight loss with existing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The STEP UP and STEP UP T2D &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are the first to investigate whether increasing the dose of semaglutide from the currently approved dose of 2.4 mg to 7.2 mg is safe and leads to additional weight reduction. Trial participants were randomized to receive either the higher 7.2 mg dose of semaglutide, the currently approved 2.4 mg dose, or placebo over 72 weeks. All participants—regardless of treatment group—received lifestyle interventions such as dietary counseling and increased physical activity recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In adults without diabetes, a 7.2 mg dose of semaglutide led to an average weight loss of nearly 19%, surpassing the 16% loss seen with 2.4 mg and 4% with placebo. Nearly half of the participants on the higher dose lost 20% or more of their &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/body+weight/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;body weight&lt;/a&gt;, with about one-third losing at least 25%. Participants also experienced improvements in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/waist+circumference/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;waist circumference&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, blood sugar, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cholesterol+levels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;, all key factors in reducing obesity-related health risks.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Similarly, in adults with obesity and T2D, the 7.2 mg dose resulted in an average 13% weight loss compared to 10% with 2.4 mg and 3.9% with placebo, along with significant reductions in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+sugar/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; levels and waist size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both trials reported that the higher dose of semaglutide was safe and generally well tolerated. Gastrointestinal side effects like nausea and diarrhea, and some sensory symptoms like tingling, were the most common. However, most side effects were manageable, resolved over time, and did not lead to participants dropping out of the trial. No increase in serious adverse events or severe hypoglycemia was observed with the higher dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By delivering greater weight reduction and metabolic benefits while maintaining a favorable safety profile, the authors say this higher dose could help more people reach their health goals and reduce the burden of obesity-related complications worldwide. However, they highlight that further research is needed to fully understand the long-term benefits and risks.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis use is linked to an almost quadrupling in the risk of developing diabetes, according to an analysis of real-world data from over 4 million adults, being presented at the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (&lt;a href="https://www.easd.org/annual-meeting/easd-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;EASD&lt;/a&gt;) held in Vienna, Austria (15–19 Sept).&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Cannabis use is increasing globally with an estimated 219 million users (4.3% of the global adult population) in 2021, but its long-term metabolic effects remain unknown. While some studies have suggested potential anti-inflammatory or weight management properties, others have raised concerns regarding glucose metabolism and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/insulin+resistance/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and the magnitude of the risk of developing diabetes hasn't been clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To strengthen the evidence base, Dr. Ibrahim Kamel from the Boston Medical Center, Massachusetts, U.S. and colleagues analyzed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electronic+health+records/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electronic health records&lt;/a&gt; from 54 health care organizations (TriNetX Research Network, with centers from across U.S. and Europe) to identify 96,795 outpatients (aged between 18 and 50 years, 52.5% female) with cannabis-related diagnoses (ranging from occasional use to dependence, including cases of intoxication and withdrawal) between 2010 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were matched with 4,160,998 healthy individuals (with no record of substance use or major chronic conditions) based on age, sex, and underlying illnesses at the start of the study, and followed for five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After controlling HDL and LDL cholesterol, uncontrolled high blood pressure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, cocaine use, alcohol use and several other lifestyle risk factors, the researchers found that new cases of diabetes were significantly higher in the cannabis group (1,937; 2.2%) compared to the healthy group (518; 0.6%), with statistical analysis showing cannabis users at nearly four times the risk of developing diabetes compared to non-users.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;While the authors note that more research is needed to fully explain the association between cannabis and diabetes, it may come down to insulin resistance and unhealthy dietary behaviors. Nevertheless, the study's results have immediate implications for metabolic monitoring practices and public health messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As cannabis becomes more widely available and socially accepted and legalized in various jurisdictions, it is essential to understand its potential health risks," said lead author Dr. Kamel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These new sights from reliable real-world evidence highlight the importance of integrating diabetes risk awareness into substance use disorder treatment and counseling, as well as the need for health care professionals to routinely talk to patients about &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cannabis+use/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cannabis use&lt;/a&gt; so that they can understand their overall diabetes risk and potential need for metabolic monitoring."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors note that more research is needed on the long-term endocrine effects of cannabis use and whether diabetes risks are limited to inhaled products or other forms of cannabis such as edibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the important findings, this is a retrospective study and cannot prove that cannabis use causes &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/diabetes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and the authors cannot rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors may have influenced the results despite efforts to reduce confounding bias via propensity score matching. This study has limitations due to a lack of detailed cannabis consumption data and potential misclassification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors acknowledge that the inherent limitations of real-world data often result from inconsistent patient reporting in electronic medical records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also note that there is a risk of bias because of imprecise measures of cannabis exposure and the reliance on participants to accurately report any cannabis use, even when they lived in places where the drug is illegal.&lt;/p&gt;

However, some seasons are longer than others, and there can be higher levels of the flu circulating as late as May. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-it-too-early-for-a-flu-shot" data-node-id="11" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.0"&gt;Is it too early for a flu shot?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Doctors generally agree that right now is too early for a flu shot. “The concern is that the protection will wane,” says &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="William Schaffner, M.D.," data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;William Schaffner, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. “If you can wait a bit, that’s better.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Infectious disease expert &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3528/amesh-adalja" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3528/amesh-adalja" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amesh A.

Adalja, M.D., &lt;/a&gt;senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, agrees. “The influenza season can last into mid-spring,” he points out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The only people who may benefit from getting vaccinated now are children under the age of 8 who have never had a flu shot, Dr. Schaffner says. “They will need two doses, spaced apart, so you can get it now and then later,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-my-flu-vaccine-options" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;What are my flu vaccine options?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You have a few choices when it comes to getting vaccinated against the flu. Most Americans under the age of 65 who get the flu shot will get a trivalent vaccine, which targets three strains of the flu, per the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="CDC" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s recommended that adults 65 and up get a quadrivalent flu vaccine, which targets four strains of the flu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;There are variations within those types of vaccines, including flu shots that are egg-free, if you prefer one of those. You also have the option of getting a nasal flu vaccine called FluMist, which is sprayed into your nose, bypassing the needle altogether. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="when-is-the-best-time-to-get-a-flu-shot" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="18.0"&gt;When is the best time to get a flu shot?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s hard to figure out an exact time to get your shot. However, the CDC usually &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2022-2023/flu-vaccination-recommendations-adopted.htm" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2022-2023/flu-vaccination-recommendations-adopted.htm" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="recommends" data-node-id="19.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; getting your shot by Halloween, aka the end of October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“October is when I recommend getting the vaccine as there is more actual influenza activity then—there is very little now,” Dr. Adalja says. “The vaccine will last further into the season if administered in October.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Also worth considering: It takes about two weeks after you’re vaccinated for your body to develop antibodies against the flu, per the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="CDC" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. So, if you have a big indoor event coming up sometime in late October or November, you may want to plan to get your flu vaccine a few weeks ahead of that, just to be safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But if now is the only time you can get vaccinated, Dr. Adalja says it’s better than nothing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-long-does-flu-shot-protection-last" data-node-id="23" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.0"&gt;How long does flu shot protection last?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s hard to put an exact number on how long protection from your flu shot will last. Everyone has different factors that influence this, including your own immune system, Dr. Schaffner says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But there is a general range you can expect. “The flu vaccine typically provides protection for about six to eight months,” says &lt;a href="https://nursing.buffalo.edu/additional-info/faculty-and-staff/faculty_directory.host.html/content/shared/nursing/faculty-and-staff-directory/faculty/full-time-faculty-profiles/haas-melinda.detail.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://nursing.buffalo.edu/additional-info/faculty-and-staff/faculty_directory.host.html/content/shared/nursing/faculty-and-staff-directory/faculty/full-time-faculty-profiles/haas-melinda.detail.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Melinda Haas, D.N.P" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Melinda Haas, D.N.P&lt;/a&gt;., clinical assistant professor at the University at Buffalo School of Nursing. “However, it’s important to note that this can vary depending on individual factors and the specific strains of the flu virus in a given season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Overall, doctors stress the importance of getting your flu vaccine. “Flu vaccination is best thought of as a way of increasing your resilience to respiratory virus season,” Dr. Adalja says. “It is an important tool to help you avoid the disruptive and serious consequences of influenza infection.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 20:15:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5qOGc2SmQ5YXE4WTZFT2h2ZFpqbFpSTGRRTnlkYnhXUVBiRy0yQ2RQTkowdmx3RDJlM0pocWhuZ2tyWjZpUHQxTEZmUmFRNkl0ZWhVbE15dG1EbURkUlVIbGo2bllsRm5LNDhIZkZZV1R2NTNOOFE</guid></item><item><title>埃博拉疫苗接种在刚果南部开始- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/world/africa/ebola-vaccination-begins-southern-congo-rcna231173</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-43e172" class="body-graf"&gt;LAGOS, Nigeria — Vaccination for those exposed to the Ebola virus and front-line health workers has begun in southern Kasai province, the World Health Organization said Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b4a394" class="body-graf"&gt;An outbreak of the highly contagious disease &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/congo-ebola-outbreak-a42c28f0c8c1a4d8cecca5072b392593"&gt;was announced&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month in the locality of Bulape, in Kasai, and has left at least 16 dead and 68 suspected cases, according to last week’s briefing by the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-62294c" class="body-graf"&gt;Only an initial 400 doses of the Ervebo vaccine have been dispatched, with the rest to be delivered later, the WHO said.

			&lt;p&gt;A new longitudinal study by an international team of researchers has found a link between eating breakfast later in the day and a greater chance of an early death among elderly people, raising questions about the relationship between mealtimes and illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just the food we eat that affects our body's health and well-being; the time we eat our meals is also known to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.039373"&gt;affect our body's functioning&lt;/a&gt;. Yet our body's condition can also determine when we may be craving a bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from 2,945 adults living in Newcastle and Manchester, UK, were collected between 1983 and 2017. The participants were aged between 42 and 94 when they signed up, and information was collected through optional questionnaires on their health, lifestyle, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-eggs-can-actually-lower-bad-cholesterol-new-study-says"&gt;eating habits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/switching-off-one-crucial-protein-appears-to-reverse-brain-aging-in-mice"&gt;Switching Off One Crucial Protein Appears to Reverse Brain Aging in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statistics revealed the volunteers tended to eat breakfast and dinner later in the day as they aged, extending their daily eating over a smaller window of time, too. These later eating times were linked to poorer physical and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-2-key-lifestyle-changes-can-treat-mild-depression-as-well-as-therapy"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to all-cause mortality – the likelihood of dying for any reason – the researchers found a significant link between eating breakfast later and a higher mortality risk. For each hour later that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/kids-who-eat-breakfast-every-day-share-something-in-common"&gt;breakfast was taken&lt;/a&gt;, the chance of dying during the study period went up 8-11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research suggests that changes in when older adults eat, especially the timing of breakfast, could serve as an easy-to-monitor marker of their overall health status," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/meal-timing-in-older-adults-health-and-longevity"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; nutrition scientist Hassan Dashti, from Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173208" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173208" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/EatingChart.jpg" alt="Eating chart" class="wp-image-173208 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/EatingChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/EatingChart-582x415.jpg 582w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/EatingChart-600x428.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173208" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers tracked eating times as people got older.

Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers aren't saying that eating breakfast later is going to cause you to die at an earlier age – or that shifting your breakfast time forward a few hours will guarantee you get &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lifespan-is-shaped-more-by-your-choices-than-your-genes-study-finds"&gt;an extra few years&lt;/a&gt; added on at the end of your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, they suggest the relationship is likely to be driven in the other direction. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-vitamin-d-slow-aging-a-new-study-says-yes-but-theres-a-catch"&gt;As we get older&lt;/a&gt; and a greater number of health problems mount up, and increase in severity, that means an earlier death is more likely, and also causes later breakfast times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poorer health leading to a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-night-of-poor-sleep-can-change-how-your-brain-sees-food"&gt;lack of sleep&lt;/a&gt; is one way that might play out, with trouble sleeping leading to difficulty getting up. Deteriorating physical health also means most tasks – including making breakfast – take longer too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Up until now, we had a limited insight into how the timing of meals evolves later in life and how this shift relates to overall health and longevity," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/meal-timing-in-older-adults-health-and-longevity"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Dashti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings help fill that gap by showing that later meal timing, especially delayed breakfast, is tied to both health challenges and increased mortality risk in older adults."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way the study findings might be useful is in identifying older people who are more at risk in terms of their health. It also gives us a greater understanding of how &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-intermittent-fasting-has-2-key-benefits-for-people-with-obesity"&gt;changes in eating habits&lt;/a&gt; might affect younger people and older people differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's population &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heat-waves-can-accelerate-aging-as-much-as-smoking-or-drinking-study-shows"&gt;is aging overall&lt;/a&gt; – meaning a larger proportion of the total number of people on the planet are older – which makes it increasingly important to spot and interpret these kinds of patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Patients and clinicians can possibly use shifts in mealtime routines as an early warning sign to look into underlying physical and mental health issues," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/meal-timing-in-older-adults-health-and-longevity"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Dashti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Also, encouraging older adults in having consistent meal schedules could become part of broader strategies to promoting healthy aging and longevity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-025-01035-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Communications Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The improvement was sustained for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The treatment could provide a safe and effective alternative for patients who “seek freedom from the inconvenience” of wearing glasses or who are unable or unwilling to access surgery, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The drops contain pilocarpine, a drug that constricts the pupils and contracts the muscle that controls the shape of the eye’s lens to enable focus on objects at different distances, and diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study involved 766 people in Argentina who used the drops twice a day, upon waking and about six hours later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They were divided into three groups, receiving different formulations. Each of the drops had a fixed dose of diclofenac, but the concentration of pilocarpine varied between 1%, 2% and 3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the 148 given the 1% drops, almost all were able to read two or more extra lines on the chart. In the 2% group, 69% of the 248 patients were able to read three or more extra lines, and in the 3% group, 84% of the 370 patients could read three or more extra lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Giovanna Benozzi, the director of the Centre for Advanced Research for Presbyopia in Buenos Aires, said: “Our most significant result showed rapid and sustained improvements in near vision for all three concentrations. One hour after having the first drops, patients had an average improvement of 3.45 Jaeger lines [the measurement used for testing near visual acuity]. The treatment also improved focus at all distances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Impressively, 99% of 148 patients in the 1% pilocarpine group reached optimal near vision and were able to read two or more extra lines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The findings suggest the therapy “offers a safe, effective and well-tolerated alternative to traditional presbyopia management”, Benozzi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Common side-effects were temporary dim vision, irritation when the drops were administered, and headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts welcomed the findings and called for more research. Prof Burkhard Dick, the president-elect of ESCRS, said: “Broader, long-term, multi-centre studies are needed to confirm safety and effectiveness before this treatment can be widely recommended.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 18:28:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOTzg2amhVYjUycFlPOVpLWEk5NW1WZHpHMGp5cWlJWm55bXVUSXJwVW5lNnhhTkV0bFgxWW9xQm15Qk5EbFI4SW50N1FvUlJoRGNBTUxYbUQwdG9RQXkxbDhVUDh2eVdzZU12ZTIxTlZJSUViZEJfMTBYUHVtZFB5NENrdlZJNFZ6aUQzOE5nV25kTFFySGg3WjdrOUV0WklDcE1hZUppOTg</guid></item><item><title>CDC授予RPI疫苗自闭症研究合同-时代联盟</title><link>https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/cdc-contract-vaccine-autism-research-rpi-21047511.php</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;TROY — The U.S. government may tap researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to investigate if there are links between vaccines and the prevalence of autism — a relationship that vaccine skeptics have long championed without evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which operates within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, intends to award the Troy institution a bid-free contract to take on such research, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-cdc-award-research-contract-vaccines-autism-2025-09-12/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Reuters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/12/cdc-autism-research-contract-vaccines" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Axios&lt;/a&gt; first reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;RPI has a “unique ability to link children to maternal cohorts using proprietary databases and de-identified data sets, enabling advanced statistical analyses within the project’s timeframe,” read &lt;a href="https://sam.gov/workspace/contract/opp/280398e7b4b54c0fac7de5efcbb80a80/view" data-link="native" class=""&gt;a notice of intent on the System for Award Management’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Ingraham, a spokesman for the college, said in a statement to the Times Union that RPI acknowledges and appreciates CDC’s intention to award the contract to the school.

Kennedy Jr., who was appointed by President Donald Trump and confirmed by Congress in February to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

          &lt;p&gt;DR Congo &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/ebola/dr-congo-declares-ebola-outbreak-kasai-province" target="_blank"&gt;declares another Ebola outbreak.&lt;/a&gt;  More &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/ebola/who-shares-more-dr-congo-ebola-outbreak-details-more-suspected-cases-reported" target="_blank"&gt;details emerge.&lt;/a&gt;  Suspected cases &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/ebola/suspected-cases-dr-congo-ebola-outbreak-rise-68" target="_blank"&gt;have risen to 68,&lt;/a&gt;  and more regions are involved.  This is a new zoonotic spillover, not related to previous outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mpox &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mpox/hot-spots-shift-africa-s-mpox-battle-cholera-activity-spikes-chad-and-republic-congo" target="_blank"&gt;Continues to be a problem for Africa&lt;/a&gt;, as the rest of the world winds down its health emergency.  Also, cholera is a severe problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A previously stored sample from a CA dairy herd &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/earlier-h5n1-detection-adds-texas-dairy-herd-total-researchers-cant" target="_blank"&gt;tested positive for H5N1,&lt;/a&gt; but no new detections have occurred in cattle in the last 30 days.  A turkey farm has been hit, the second recent detection in South Dakota.  Avian flu &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/cdc-says-avian-flu-may-infect-gut-though-risk-low" target="_blank"&gt;may infect the gut, though the risk is considered low.&lt;/a&gt;  Seems clear to me that pets infected by raw foods got it that way, not by breathing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In related developments, a multisector group made up of experts in poultry, public health, science, and policy is meeting for the first time this week in Brazil to address the escalating avian flu threat to animal health, human health, and livelihoods, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/avian-influenza--first-global-dialogue-targets-the-rising-pandemic-threat/en" target="_blank"&gt;said today&lt;/a&gt;. The group called the response unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avian flu is now a global challenge, not a sporadic threat, Beth Bechdol, MS, the FAO's deputy director-general, said in a statement, "No single country or sector can tackle this threat in isolation—and failure is not an option. Practical, science-based collaboration like this is essential to protect our agrifood systems, livelihoods, and public health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the OTHER bird flus is still causing human cases &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/four-more-h9n2-avian-flu-cases-confirmed-china" target="_blank"&gt;In China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was measles exposure &lt;a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2025/09/09/repub/utah-health-officials-warn-of-measles-exposure-at-large-cycling-event/?emci=19ddf5c1-ca8d-f011-b484-6045bdeb7413&amp;amp;emdi=86e572af-3d8e-f011-b484-6045bdeb7413&amp;amp;ceid=491687" target="_blank"&gt;At a large cycling event in Utah.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sad reminder that measles can kill years later: an LA child &lt;a href="http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/la-county-confirms-childs-death-late-measles-complication" target="_blank"&gt;Who caught measles as an infant&lt;/a&gt; has died of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a rare and fatal sequel of measles that occurs 10 or more years after the original infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States are stepping up &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/minnesota-new-york-issue-executive-orders-promoting-access-covid-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;To secure vaccine access for their citizens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New studies show &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/studies-show-how-common-long-covid-globally-and-teens" target="_blank"&gt;just how prevalent long Covid is.&lt;/a&gt;  To be avoided if at all possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you might give &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/dogs-exposed-covid-positive-people-show-increased-risk-infection" target="_blank"&gt;Covid to your dog&lt;/a&gt;, who really doesn't deserve it either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthy full term infants are also &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/respiratory-syncytial-virus-rsv/severe-rsv-doesnt-spare-healthy-full-term-infants-data-suggest" target="_blank"&gt;at risk of severe RSV illness&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting the need for maternal and infant vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salmonella in delivered meals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has posted a notice about a&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Salmonella&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Enteritidis outbreak linked to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/outbreaks/homedeliverymeals-09-25/investigation.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;meals from Metabolic Meals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a home delivery company. So far, at least 16 people in 10 states have been sickened, with 7 people requiring hospitalization. No deaths have been reported.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the odd diseases corner we have N. meningitidis eye infections &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/misc-emerging-topics/report-describes-n-meningitidis-conjunctivitis-outbreak-us-military-base" target="_blank"&gt;on a military base.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/borealpox/six-recent-sporadic-borealpox-cases-alaska-tied-rodents" target="_blank"&gt;Boreal pox in Alaska,&lt;/a&gt; which is spread from rodents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multidrug resistant &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/candida-auris/multidrug-resistant-yeast-cases-rising-rapidly-europe-survey-shows" target="_blank"&gt;Candidiasis in European hospitals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Jamestown Canyon virus, first human case &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/misc-emerging-topics/vermont-reports-its-first-human-jamestown-canyon-case" target="_blank"&gt;In Vermont.&lt;/a&gt;  No, I never heard of it before either.  It's spread by mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The voluntary recall of some &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/dermarite-industries-issues-voluntary-nationwide-recall-dermakleen-dermasarra-kleenfoam-and" target="_blank"&gt;DermaRite products&lt;/a&gt; has expanded, due to Burkholderia contamination.&lt;/p&gt;

The disease had arrived with cattle imported from the West Indies and Mexico in the 1600s, and it was taking &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/exhibits/speccoll/exhibits/show/parasitic-diseases-with-econom/parasitic-diseases-with-econom/texas-cattle-fever" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nal.usda.gov/exhibits/speccoll/exhibits/show/parasitic-diseases-with-econom/parasitic-diseases-with-econom/texas-cattle-fever" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;huge tolls on cattle herds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

But increasingly, evidence points to another culprit that can harm cardiovascular health. Most of us are not aware and never would have thought that this, could also be the reason of heart attacks that are increasing by the second. Modern foods and lifestyle patterns are quietly undermining the body's capacity for nitric oxide production, a molecule that is essential for keeping blood vessels functional and the heart healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eric Berg, a trained wellness expert and best-selling author, warns about how a potential decrease in nitric oxide can significantly lead to heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Beware!

Sometimes, we need to look away from the obvious food items to know what is actually harming our heart and body. Refined sugar, processed starches, industrial seed oils, smoking, and even run-of-the-mill mouthwash can sneakily compromise the body's nitric oxide production capability. This degrades the blood vessels and enhances the risk of cardiovascular disease in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 15:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9wFBVV95cUxNa3BZVlFJZmZQd3h5dW9iM29UOUlUekNkcWhhR0F3eU1YVVdOZ19mVXlGZlBKVF9kOGtzdnp0bGJ3VS1CQ2RJSFZyWmluQjFHT1FZbVJtT242N2dJVXdsN016ZGlHNC1KTjN6VG9rTjU1ckV5U0xiWlN5ZG9JbEltUHdJalAyQnk0MlBydGF6bl96Wk1zVHV1cUdkM0RIWERMWi1leGxrNkJYT2NQbnQyLWNLbXRwYWJybjFjeXYwZ3VJVjBCWDlxcVZFbGg3TXlpU2xqNklQcHB5SWZaaWRzTS1KTjVYMjAwSHdLaGVfc19nSUptVFpr</guid></item><item><title>根据科学研究，这种看似无害的饮料以关键的方式加速衰老- valleyvanguardonline.com</title><link>https://www.valleyvanguardonline.com/this-seemingly-harmless-drink-speeds-up-aging-in-a-critical-way-according-to-science/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"&gt;
			&lt;p data-start="90" data-end="459"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="90" data-end="457"&gt;&lt;em data-start="92" data-end="455"&gt;For many of us, it’s the drink we reach for at lunch, during a movie, or when we need a quick burst of energy. It feels refreshing in the moment, but research shows this sweet habit may actually be shaving years off our lives. Scientists warn that one of the world’s most popular beverages doesn’t just damage our health—it accelerates the aging process itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-5177416233695826" data-ad-slot="3757471395" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-start="90" data-end="459"&gt;&lt;span id="more-3607"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="460" data-end="515"&gt;Premature Aging: The Drink Behind Cellular Decline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="516" data-end="1082"&gt;The culprit? &lt;strong&gt;Soda&lt;/strong&gt;. Beyond the sugar highs and inevitable crashes, sodas have been directly linked to premature cellular aging. A landmark 2014 study published in the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em data-start="682" data-end="717"&gt;American Journal of Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; found that people who regularly drank soda had shorter telomeres—protective caps at the ends of our chromosomes. Think of telomeres like the plastic tips on shoelaces; when they wear down, the laces fray. In our bodies, shorter telomeres mean reduced longevity and a higher risk of chronic illnesses such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 data-start="1083" data-end="1119"&gt;What Scientists Have Discovered&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1120" data-end="1566"&gt;Elissa Epel, a professor of psychiatry at the &lt;strong&gt;University of &lt;a href="https://www.valleyvanguardonline.com/neon-blue-wild-pigs-in-california-the-surprising-reason-behind-their-color-change/"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, San Francisco&lt;/strong&gt;, explained in an interview that sugary soda consumption not only overwhelms the body’s ability to regulate sugar but also speeds up cellular aging in multiple tissues. What’s striking is that these effects show up regardless of age, income, ethnicity, or education level. In other words, nobody gets a free pass—soda’s impact on cellular health is universal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1567" data-end="1612"&gt;More Than Just Sugar: The Hidden Effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1613" data-end="2011"&gt;Newer research reinforces these findings. A 2021 review in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em data-start="1672" data-end="1699"&gt;Current Nutrition Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; highlighted how sugary drinks disrupt the gut microbiome, fuel chronic inflammation, and increase oxidative stress. These three biological processes are well-known drivers of premature aging. Taken together, they paint a clear picture: soda isn’t just a guilty pleasure, it’s a catalyst for long-term decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2012" data-end="2056"&gt;A Short-Term Pleasure, A Long-Term Cost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2057" data-end="2481"&gt;Of course, enjoying a cold soda on a hot day feels harmless—even nostalgic. Many of us grew up associating it with family meals, summer picnics, or celebrations. But as science continues to uncover the hidden costs, nutritionists are urging people to rethink their daily habits. Alternatives like sparkling water with a squeeze of lemon or unsweetened iced tea can deliver the same refreshment without the cellular damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-4"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-5177416233695826" data-ad-slot="2855453267" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 data-start="2482" data-end="2519"&gt;Think Twice Before Your Next Sip&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2520" data-end="2908" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""&gt;The occasional soda won’t undo years of healthy living, but making it a regular habit can quietly chip away at your body’s resilience. As researchers remind us, aging is inevitable—but accelerating it through what we drink is not. The next time you find yourself craving that fizzy sweetness, it might be worth pausing to consider: is the momentary satisfaction worth the price of time?&lt;/p&gt;

This common and disabling disease that affects the brain occurs when brain cells are damaged or die, leading to progressive declines in cognitive functions, mood, behavior, and personality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/fact-check-are-heart-attacks-caused-by-bacterial-infections/articleshow/123884019.cms"&gt;Fact check: Are heart attacks caused by bacterial infections?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/kidney-health-best-herbal-teas-for-kidney-support-besides-water-and-supplements/amp_etphotostory/123864389.cms"&gt;Kidney health: Best herbal teas for kidney support besides water and supplements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With over 55 million people with dementia worldwide currently, nearly 10 million new cases develop each year. The number of people with dementia is growing worldwide and is expected to triple by 2050. Despite the prevalence of the disabling disease, when most people think of dementia, the first thing that comes to mind is memory loss, like forgetting names, appointments, or where things are. While memory decline is very common, dementia involves much more than that. Early on, there are other changes, subtle signals, that often go unnoticed. These can be changes in behaviour, language, perception, coordination, or mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bing, MD, MPH, a renowned neurologist with over 170K followers on Instagram, says the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers warn that spotting these non-memory signs early can lead to faster diagnosis, better care, and more time to plan. Many dementia types – such as Alzheimer’s, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, and vascular dementia – show these symptoms. But because these signs are subtler, they are sometimes ignored or chalked up to stress, age, or mood. That delay in recognizing these non-memory signals means missed opportunities for early treatment, support, and slowing of progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you know what to watch for, you can help yourself or someone you care about get help sooner. Let’s look at 5 non-memory signs of dementia: what they are, how to spot them, which dementia types tend to show them, and when to talk to a doctor. Recognizing these signs is not about fear – it’s about awareness, so that early support, treatment, or lifestyle changes can make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在无树岛上意外发现的古老热带雨林- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/pollen-from-ancient-tropical-forest-accidentally-discovered-on-a-treeless-island/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Falkland Islands are known today for cool winds, broad grasslands, and very few trees.

It was not random debris. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fossilized-frozen-forest-reveals-climate-impacts-on-ancient-alpine-ecosystems/"&gt;buried forest&lt;/a&gt; bed – plant-heavy sediment preserved in place – holding microscopic grains and real pieces of ancient wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-forest-pollen-and-wood-fragments"&gt;Forest pollen and wood fragments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists collected three kinds of evidence: pollen grains, spores, and chunks of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/north-americas-oldest-known-pterosaur-eotephradactylus-mcintireae-discovered-arizona/"&gt;fossilized wood&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pollen and spores keep their species-specific shapes for millions of years when they get trapped in wet sediment and then buried. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood fragments preserve internal features that point to the type of tree and the conditions in which it grew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This layer is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/lignite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lignitic&lt;/a&gt; – formed as plant material piled up in waterlogged, low-oxygen settings where leaves and twigs do not fully rot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, that mush compressed into a dense, carbon-rich stratum, likely in a shallow, protected basin near the coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-collecting-and-identifying-samples"&gt;Collecting and identifying samples&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the discovery, Dr. Zoë Thomas of the &lt;a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Southampton&lt;/a&gt; hurried to the site with colleagues to salvage fresh samples before they dried and cracked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The tree remains were so pristinely preserved they looked like driftwood,” recalled Dr. Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lab, the team separated tiny grains from the sediment and examined them under high magnification. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mix showed southern beech (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/nothofagus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nothofagus&lt;/a&gt;) and podocarps – Southern Hemisphere conifers – alongside moisture-loving plants that thrive in soggy ground. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fossil pollen, spores, and wood paint a much different picture of the ancient environment, providing direct evidence of cool, wet forests,” noted Michael Donovan, collections manager at &lt;a href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chicago’s Field Museum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reading-the-forest-s-pollen-and-wood"&gt;Reading the forest’s pollen and wood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pollen alone can be misleading because wind can carry it far. That is why the wood matters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/giant-trees-never-seen-before-up-to-3000-years-old-tessmannia-princeps-tasmania/"&gt;Wood anatomy&lt;/a&gt; – cell sizes, pits, and rays – helps confirm whether pieces came from conifers or broadleaf trees and whether the community matches the pollen record. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, it does. The agreement points to a local forest, not distant pollen that drifted in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern relatives of Nothofagus and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podocarpus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;podocarps&lt;/a&gt; form cool, mossy forests in parts of southern Chile and Patagonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their presence in the Falklands’ fossil record supports the idea that the islands once held a wet, shaded habitat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dating-the-forest-fossils"&gt;Dating the forest fossils&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiocarbon dating tops out around 50,000 years, so the team turned to regional comparison. They lined up the Falklands’ pollen ‘cast’ with well-dated South American records. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the same key pollen types appear and fade in the same order across sites, timelines can be matched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those comparisons point to the mid-to-late Cenozoic – tens of millions of years ago – when warmer intervals let rainforests extend to higher latitudes and outlying islands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/09/13202756/ancient-forest_treeless-island_falklands_pollen-discovered_1m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/09/13202803/ancient-forest_treeless-island_falklands_pollen-discovered_1s.webp" alt="Selected photomicrographs of fossil pollen produced in an ancient forest by gymnosperm and angiosperm living relatives in the rainforest of southern South America.

Seeds and spores ride wind, float on ocean debris, and travel with birds. During milder, wetter stretches, the odds of survival jump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once early trees took root in a sheltered, waterlogged basin, they could trap moisture, calm ground-level winds, and gradually build a stable community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a familiar pattern in island biology. Given time and the right conditions, a few arrivals can turn into a functioning forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The climate shifted. Cooling trends and glacial cycles brought colder, windier conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Falklands lack high mountains to block strong westerlies or snag extra rainfall, and many soils are thin and peaty. Those factors make it hard for trees to outcompete grasses today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystems do not just follow latitude. Local wind, rainfall, and topography set the rules. Under the current rules, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mountain-greening-threatens-genetic-diversity-of-iconic-plants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;open grassland&lt;/a&gt; wins across most of the islands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-any-of-this-matter"&gt;Why does any of this matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fossil evidence gives climate scientists real targets for testing models. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a model run with mid-to-late &lt;a href="https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/cenozoic/cenozoic.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cenozoic&lt;/a&gt; conditions places a cool-temperate rainforest on the Falklands, that is a sign it is on track. If it does not, something is missing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These checks turn evidence from a single site into valuable test data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a wider lesson. Ecosystems can move, shrink, expand, or appear in places that seem unusual by today’s standards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Falklands’ buried forest shows how temperature, rainfall, and wind can reshuffle living communities over long spans of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-the-case"&gt;Building the case&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fieldwork documented and sampled the lignitic layer in place. Lab work isolated pollen and spores, then identified them under microscopes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood pieces were sectioned to reveal diagnostic features. Together, those signals established both habitat and local origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For age, researchers matched the Falklands’ pollen sequence to dated South American profiles, tracking the same marker taxa as they rose and fell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That approach pinned the layer to a deep time window without relying on radiocarbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-have-we-learned"&gt;What have we learned?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, hidden beneath Stanley on the Falkland Islands lies a pollen record of a cool, wet forest dominated by southern beech and podocarp relatives, growing in a sheltered, waterlogged basin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The age falls in the mid-to-late Cenozoic, when warmer intervals allowed trees to push farther poleward and onto islands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This clear snapshot – written in pollen, spores, and wood – adds a useful data point to Earth’s climate history and helps scientists check the tools we use to understand past, present, and future change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antarctic-science/article/evidence-for-a-floristically-diverse-rainforest-on-the-falkland-archipelago-in-the-remote-south-atlantic-during-the-mid-to-late-cenozoic/B4CFF913DD8F1BB43B570E4086C7CF7B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Antarctic Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Francesco Bettariga, lead study researcher and PhD student at Edith Cowan University in Australia, told the Daily Mail: 'By demonstrating anti-cancer effects at the cellular level, our results provide a potential explanation for why exercise reduces the risk of cancer progression, recurrence, and mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While our study has limitations and further in vivo work is needed, these findings highlight how exercise could contribute to improved survival outcomes in people with cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published earlier this summer in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10549-025-07772-w"&gt;Breast Cancer Research and Treatment&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 32 patients who had been treated for breast cancer, ranging from stage one to stage three, at least four months beforehand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The largest cancer stage group was stage two (41 percent). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average participant age was 59 with a body mass index (BMI) of 28, which is considered overweight but not obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in the resistance training group completed eight repetitions of five sets of exercises for major muscle groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These included chest press, seated row, shoulder press, lateral pulldown, leg press, leg extension, leg curl and lunges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in this group got one to two minutes between sets to rest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the HIIT group, participants performed seven 30-second bouts of high-intensity exercise on at least three of the following exercise machines: stationary bike, treadmill, rower and cross-trainer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They had three-minute rest periods between sets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bettariga told this website: 'We selected two distinct exercise modalities—resistance and aerobic training—because they provide different physiological benefits: resistance training improves muscle strength, while aerobic training enhances cardiorespiratory fitness in order to determine which exercise could drive greater cancer-suppressive effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Specifically, we used a high-intensity exercise to determine whether greater intensity could amplify these anti-cancer effects.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both groups completed about 45 minutes of exercise in total. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also performed blood tests on participants at three separate times: before working out, immediately following the sessions and 30 minutes after working out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found that completing either the resistance or HIIT regimen just one time increased levels of myokines in participants' blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The largest jump was in the myokine IL-6, which increased 47 percent in the HIIT group immediately after exercise. Myokine IL-6 is a protein released from muscles during exercise that plays a crucial role in immune function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, the resistance group showed a 23 percent increase in decorin, a myokin that regulates tissue growth, and a nine percent increase in IL-6. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found myokine levels gradually decreased over time after participants finished working out, though they remained elevated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on results, researchers estimated the myokine levels produced from exercising could reduce the growth of cancer cells by 20 to 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Myokines have been shown to suppress inflammatory proteins called cytokines. Cytokines are secreted by immune cells to control inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, high cytokine levels can trigger excess inflammation, which damages cell DNA and increases the risk of cancer cells forming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Breast cancer is one of the most common forms of the disease, striking 311,000 US women every year and killing 42,000 (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A recent study in JAMA found that breast cancer rates went up by about 0.79 percent each year during the study from from 2000 to 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bettariga said: 'We found that both resistance training and HIIT increased the release of myokines with anti-cancer properties after just a single exercise session. We then observed a reduction of up to 30 percent in cancer cell growth in [lab testing]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What stood out was that both modalities had comparable effects, suggesting that exercise intensity is the main driver of these anti-cancer changes, rather than the specific type of exercise performed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Breast cancer strikes 311,000 American women every year and kills 42,000, according to the American cancer society. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the disease generally has a high survival rate of 92 percent, that rate can drop as low as 33 percent if cancer cells spread to other areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's also on the rise among young women, with rates increasing by 0.8 percent every year from 2000 to 2019, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14177967/breast-cancer-rising-doctors-warn-american-women-report.html"&gt;one study suggests&lt;/a&gt;. Experts have tied this rise to hormone-disrupting chemicals and early menstruation, which can increase exposure to hormones like estrogen that can fuel breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though the new study results are promising for breast cancer, it's unclear if they would translate to other forms of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bettargia said: 'Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and the leading cause of cancer-related death in women. Surprisingly, no studies with this specific design had been conducted in this population, making our findings highly relevant to millions of women living with breast cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations, including the small sample size and focusing on only one form of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bettariga told this website that the team next plans to investigate these effects in other types of cancer and groups of people with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'Furthermore, it is now time to examine the effects of regular, long-term exercise programs on these anti-cancer responses. We also aim to explore additional mechanisms particularly the role of the immune system, which plays a crucial part in controlling cancer cell growth.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Francesco Bettariga, lead study researcher and PhD student at Edith Cowan University in Australia, told the Daily Mail: 'By demonstrating anti-cancer effects at the cellular level, our results provide a potential explanation for why exercise reduces the risk of cancer progression, recurrence, and mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While our study has limitations and further in vivo work is needed, these findings highlight how exercise could contribute to improved survival outcomes in people with cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published earlier this summer in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10549-025-07772-w"&gt;Breast Cancer Research and Treatment&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 32 patients who had been treated for breast cancer, ranging from stage one to stage three, at least four months beforehand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The largest cancer stage group was stage two (41 per cent). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average participant age was 59 with a body mass index (BMI) of 28, which is considered overweight but not obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in the resistance training group completed eight repetitions of five sets of exercises for major muscle groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These included chest press, seated rows, shoulder press, lateral pulldowns, leg press, leg extensions, leg curls and lunges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in this group got one to two minutes between sets to rest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the HIIT group, participants performed seven 30-second bouts of high-intensity exercise on at least three of the following exercise machines: stationary bike, treadmill, rower and cross-trainer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They had three-minute rest periods between sets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bettariga told this website: 'We selected two distinct exercise modalities—resistance and aerobic training—because they provide different physiological benefits: resistance training improves muscle strength, while aerobic training enhances cardio-respiratory fitness in order to determine which exercise could drive greater cancer-suppressive effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Specifically, we used a high-intensity exercise to determine whether greater intensity could amplify these anti-cancer effects.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both groups completed about 45 minutes of exercise in total. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also performed blood tests on participants at three separate times: before working out, immediately following the sessions and 30 minutes after working out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found that completing either the resistance or HIIT regimen just one time increased levels of myokines in participants' blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The largest jump was in the myokine IL-6, which increased 47 per cent in the HIIT group immediately after exercise. IL-6 is a protein released from muscles during exercise that plays a crucial role in immune function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, the resistance group showed a 23 per cent increase in decorin, a myokin that regulates tissue growth, and a nine per cent increase in IL-6. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found myokine levels gradually decreased over time after participants finished working out, though they remained elevated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on results, researchers estimated the myokine levels produced from exercising could reduce the growth of cancer cells by 20 to 30 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Myokines have been shown to suppress inflammatory proteins called cytokines. Cytokines are secreted by immune cells to control inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, high cytokine levels can trigger excess inflammation, which damages cell DNA and increases the risk of cancer cells forming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Breast cancer is one of the most common forms of the disease, striking 311,000 US women every year and killing 42,000&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A recent study in JAMA found that breast cancer rates went up by about 0.79 per cent each year from 2000 to 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bettariga said: 'We found that both resistance training and HIIT increased the release of myokines with anti-cancer properties after just a single exercise session. We then observed a reduction of up to 30 per cent in cancer cell growth in [lab testing]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What stood out was that both modalities had comparable effects, suggesting that exercise intensity is the main driver of these anti-cancer changes, rather than the specific type of exercise performed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Breast cancer strikes 311,000 American women every year and kills 42,000, according to the American Cancer Society. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the disease generally has a high survival rate of 92 per cent, that rate can drop as low as 33 per cent if cancer cells spread to other areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's also on the rise among young women, with rates increasing by 0.8 per cent every year from 2000 to 2019, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14177967/breast-cancer-rising-doctors-warn-american-women-report.html"&gt;one study suggests&lt;/a&gt;. Experts have tied this rise to hormone-disrupting chemicals and early menstruation, which can increase exposure to hormones like estrogen that can fuel breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though the new study results are promising for breast cancer, it's unclear if they would translate to other forms of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bettargia said: 'Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and the leading cause of cancer-related death in women. Surprisingly, no studies with this specific design had been conducted in this population, making our findings highly relevant to millions of women living with breast cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations, including the small sample size and the focus on only one form of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bettariga told this website that the team next plans to investigate these effects in other types of cancer and groups of people with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'It is now time to examine the effects of regular, long-term exercise programs on these anti-cancer responses. We also aim to explore additional mechanisms, particularly the role of the immune system, which plays a crucial part in controlling cancer cell growth.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

And with the accessibility of ingredients and products easier than ever, the variety of diets is vast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Here DailyMail.com speaks to a number of health experts to get their verdicts on the best and worst diets launched over the past century and the old reliable that has stood the test of time.

    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;THE WORST &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;JUICE CLEANSES: 1/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While juice cleanses have become all the rage over the past decade or so after gaining mainstream popularity in the 1990s and 2000s, many health experts are less excited about the concept. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike other diets, a juice cleanse is a temporary dietary regimen that involves consuming only fruit and vegetable juices for a predetermined period, typically ranging from a few days to a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is often promoted as a way to detoxify the body, lose weight, and improve overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New York-based personal trainer Natalie Alex told this website: 'More recently overly restrictive "detoxes" or juice cleanses often promise quick fixes but leave people depleted, with results that rarely last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These fads tend to ignore balance and sustainability, which is why people so often rebound after them.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, New York dermatologist Dr Michele Green isn't a fan of juice cleanses and she gives them just a one out of 10. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Unlike other diets, a juice cleanse is a temporary dietary regimen that involves consuming only fruit and vegetable juices for a predetermined period, typically ranging from a few days to a week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Detox diets, including juice cleanses and liquid cleanses, are also not sustainable and often do not provide enough daily nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These extreme diets lack scientific support. Additionally, the body is equipped with mechanisms and organs that effectively flush out potential toxins without the need for detox diets.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health also warns of the dangers of juice cleanses, with some of the side effects including 'dangerous electrolyte imbalances', headaches, fainting, weakness, and dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;THE KETO DIET: 2/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many health experts Daily Mail spoke to rated the keto diet as one of the worst eating regimens from the past century. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet was first introduced in the 1920s as a treatment for epilepsy by Dr Russell Wilder at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was designed to mimic the effects of fasting by drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and increasing fat consumption. This helps to manage epilepsy by inducing a metabolic state called ketosis, when the body burns fat energy instead of glucose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ketosis has been shown to have an anti-seizure effect in people with epilepsy, though the mechanism behind the connection is not fully understood. It could be a change in brain chemistry, change in neuronal activity or improvement in cell function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet encourages followers to eat butter, avocado, coconut, bacon, cream, cheese and some nuts but avoid grains, milk, yogurt, most fruits, legumes, potatoes and many vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Keto diet encourages the consumption of meats, butter and cheese&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Dietitian's Association of Australia, keto diet isn't recommended for the general population as the long-term efficacy and safety of the diet are unknown, having only been studied in the short-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sophie Scott, who is a nutritionist based out of Australia, gave the keto diet a two out of 10 in terms of its effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: 'Keto forces the body to use fat (or more specifically, ketones) as the main fuel source instead of glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Carbohydrates are severely restricted to around 50g per day (equivalent to two slices of bread and a banana) and fat constitutes 70 percent of this diet.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Heart Association also does not recommend the diet for long-term success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts from the organization explain: 'In studies up to six months long, improvements in body weight and blood sugar have been shown with these diets. However, after a year, most improvements were no different from the results of a less restrictive diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Restrictions on fruits, whole grains and legumes may result in reduced fiber intake. Additionally, these diets are high in fat without limiting saturated fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Consuming high levels of saturated fat and low levels of fiber are both linked to the development of cardiovascular disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;SOUTH  BEACH DIET: 3/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The South Beach Diet focuses on eliminating refined carbs and prioritizing healthy fats like olive oil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The South Beach Diet was developed in the mid-1990s by Dr Arthur Agatston, a cardiologist, to help his patients with heart disease and diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It gained widespread popularity in 2003 with the release of his best-selling book, The South Beach Diet, which explained the diet's principles for weight loss and improved health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet focuses on eliminating refined carbs and prioritizing healthy fats like olive oil. However, the experts warn that like keto, it can be restrictive and for this reason, they give it a three out of 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first phase, which lasts for 14 days, involves eating three meals and two snacks daily, mainly protein and non-starchy vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After that, participants add small amounts of whole grains and fruits, as well as small amounts of alcohol. This phase lasts as long as it takes you to reach your goal weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the final phase, no food is off limits, but participants pay strict attention to serving sizes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The South Beach Diet says that you'll lose 8lbs to 13lbs during phase one, with most of the weight coming from your midsection. In phase two, it says that you'll likely lose 1lb to 2lbs per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no research suggesting that the South Beach diet leads to long-term weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sharon Palmer, a dietitian at the Plant-Powered Dietitian, said: 'This diet would be hard to follow in the context of cultural diets, and it reinforces diet culture. I would not recommend this diet overall for weight loss.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;THE BEST &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;THE MEDITERRANEAN DIET: 9/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Mediterranean diet is rich in fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, legumes and olive oil, and features moderate amounts of fish and poultry - and the occasional glass of red wine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long touted by health experts as the secret to a lengthy, healthy life, the Mediterranean diet has been crowned one of the healthiest nutritional plans for promoting an approach to healthy eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The concept of the Mediterranean diet was first coined in the 1960s by American biologist Ancel Keys, but its origins trace back to ancient times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's rich in fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, legumes and olive oil, and features moderate amounts of fish and poultry - and the occasional glass of red wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet eliminates added sugars, refined grains like white breads and pasta, trans fats like in margarine, canola oil and processed meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nutritionist Sophie Scott told Daily Mail: 'The diet is a 10 out of 10 because it is more of an eating pattern, rather than a prescriptive diet, which makes it easier to follow consistently than other more restrictive diets.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She referenced a research paper that found the diet consistently performs well in relation to weight loss, reduction in cardiovascular disease and reduction of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The PREDIMED study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2013, showed the Mediterranean diet group had a third less heart disease, diabetes and stroke than the low-fat group. They also lost a little weight and had less memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The benefits can't be narrowed down to one single food or factor but to some general themes,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Extra fiber, a diverse range of fruits and vegetables, whole grains and legumes, yoghurts and cheese, small amounts of fish and meat, red wine, nuts and seeds and good quality olive oil all played their part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, the authors believe that the olive oil itself was the most powerful single factor.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fitness expert Natalie Alex is also a fan of the Mediterranean diet, as she says it is less of a fad and more of a lifestyle. She gives it a nine out of 10. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained: 'It supports both long-term health and enjoyment of food, which is key. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And on the fitness front, the shift toward higher-protein, strength-supporting nutrition in recent years has been beneficial for people looking to maintain lean mass and metabolic health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Harvard researchers found that people who followed the DASH diet for 30 years had a 14 percent lower risk of coronary heart disease and strokes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;THE DASH DIET: 8.5/10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beloved by many health experts, the DASH diet was introduced in 1997 by NIH-supported research teams and it was designed to reduce high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have since shown that the DASH diet can have positive effects on cardiovascular health and may have other health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The eating plan encourages eating fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It favors lean sources of protein, like beans and lean meats, and suggests limiting saturated fats and sugar-sweetened food and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts at the American Heart Association rate this diet at 8.5 out of 10. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They explain: 'The DASH-style eating pattern received a perfect score by meeting all of the Association's guidance. These eating patterns are low in salt, added sugar, alcohol, tropical oils and processed foods, and rich in non-starchy vegetables, fruits, whole grains and legumes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Protein tends to be mostly from plant sources (such as legumes, beans or nuts), along with fish or seafood, lean poultry and meats, and low-fat or fat-free dairy products.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Harvard researchers found that people who followed the diet for 30 years had a 14 percent lower risk of coronary heart disease and strokes compared to people on a standard diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;New York cosmetic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.michelegreenmd.com/botox-nyc"&gt;dermatologist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Dr Michele Green says the DASH diet is also 'excellent' for the skin, as it limits processed sugar and unhealthy fats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'You really notice a glow on this plan,' she adds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;WEIGHT WATCHERS: 7/10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Popularized by dozens of celebrities, from Oprah Winfrey to Kate Hudson, Weight Watchers doesn't involve counting calories. Instead, foods are assigned a certain amount of points based on their nutrients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the top of the diet list with many health experts is the old American favorite diet, Weight Watchers. It got a seven out of 10 overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Introduced in 1963 by Jean Nidetch in New York, it started as a small social support group for friends to lose weight together and today it has more than 3.4 million subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Popularized by dozens of celebrities, from Oprah Winfrey to Kate Hudson, Weight Watchers doesn't involve counting calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, foods are assigned a certain amount of points based on their nutrients, such as fiber, added sugars, protein, and fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Foods with more unhealthy nutrients like added sugars and fat, and too little of vital compounds like fiber, are assigned more points. Dieters are allotted a specific amount of points to use daily and weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doug Cook, a registered dietitian in Toronto, told US News and World Report: 'Weight Watchers helps people to understand balance in so far that no food is off limits, helping it to be sustainable in the long run. It focuses on wholesome foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, etc.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study published in the BMJ involving 740 overweight or obese participants found that those who used Weight Watchers lost the most weight compared to those on other diets, dropping an average of 9.8lbs after 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, in a review of 45 studies, researchers found that after 12 months of Weight Watchers, members lost 2.6 percent more weight than those who received no weight loss guidance or education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;THE OLD RELIABLE - 10/10&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Instead of a fad diet or brand, the experts say having a grasp of what eating well looks like is of utmost importance and maintaining a healthy balance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When quizzed about which diet has stood the test of time as the 'old reliable,' the health experts revealed a surprising answer: 'just a balanced diet.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead of a fad diet or costly branded products, they say having a grasp of what eating well looks like is of utmost importance when it comes to keeping in shape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Los Angeles-based Dr Raj Dasgupta told this website: 'The one approach that never goes out of style is eating a variety of real, unprocessed foods, watching portions, and moving your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not flashy, but it's reliable and backed by decades of solid research.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He recommends stocking up on plenty of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats while limiting ultra-processed foods and added sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Michele Green says from her own experience too, a diet in moderation is the one that has always worked best for her. She says eliminating certain food groups can often lead to people giving up and creating an unhealthy relationship with food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adds: 'While I think it is important to reduce the consumption of sugary foods, sweets do not need to be cut out completely and can be consumed in moderation.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, fitness trainer Natalie Alex concludes: 'Looking ahead, I think we'll see less focus on rigid diets and more emphasis on personalized nutrition plans built around someone's lifestyle, preferences, and health needs, instead of strict rules that are hard to follow long-term.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Many people feel fine until severe damage has already occurred. According to the CDC, in 2023, high blood pressure was a primary or contributing cause of 664,470 deaths in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sudhanshu Rai recently posted on Instagram that you don’t always need elaborate fixes—"it needs consistency."

It helps your kidneys excrete sodium and eases tension in blood vessel walls. Foods rich in potassium are strongly recommended in blood pressure management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A medium banana has ~ 422 mg of potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Drink hibiscus tea twice daily&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hibiscus (Hibiscus sabdariffa) has been studied for its blood pressure-lowering effects.

Its active compound allicin seems to help dilate blood vessels, reduce arterial stiffness, and lower blood pressure modestly in hypertensive people. Beyond BP, garlic is anti-inflammatory, supports lipid profiles etc., making it a strong component of a cardioprotective diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Walk 40 minutes daily, no exceptions&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is one of the strongest non-drug interventions for high blood pressure.

Green tea has lower caffeine and comes loaded with antioxidants (catechins, etc.), which may improve endothelial function (lining of blood vessels) and reduce oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eat a handful of walnuts daily&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walnuts are rich in healthy fats (especially polyunsaturated fats, including omega-3s), antioxidants, magnesium, and other nutrients. Nuts have been associated with improved lipid profiles, lower inflammation, and modest improvements in blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Meditate 10 minutes before bed&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress elevates blood pressure via sympathetic (fight-or-flight) activation, raising heart rate, vascular constriction. Relaxation and meditation reduce stress hormones like cortisol, improve autonomic balance (more parasympathetic activity), help lower BP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cut processed foods completely&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed foods often contain high sodium, hidden salts, unhealthy fats, added sugars, preservatives. These contribute to hypertension, dyslipidemia, weight gain, inflammation. Eliminating processed foods means you better control what you eat: you reduce excess sodium, improve nutrient density, and avoid additives that may worsen BP. This supports all the other habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sudhanshu explains that if the above mentioned routine works for someone, they should repeat it for 10 weeks for better results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

			&lt;p&gt;If the sound of a baby crying gets you red in the face, you're not just imagining things. A new study has found that an infant's cries – particularly those that signal pain – really do trigger a hot flush in adults' faces, perhaps as a way of launching us into action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies' wailing is, in a sense, unbearable on purpose. Without language, it's an infant's best shot at getting &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cuddling-babies-alters-genetics-dna-for-years"&gt;the help they need&lt;/a&gt; from their caregivers. &lt;span&gt;The vibrations that erupt from a baby in serious distress are quite literally more chaotic than the cries of low-level discomfort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cries of pain are formed differently than other sounds a baby makes: they forcefully contract their ribcage, pushing high-pressure bursts of air through their vocal cords to produce variable pitches and disharmonious sounds known to acousticians as '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_acoustics"&gt;nonlinear phenomena&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;', or NLPs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-research-could-help-to-redraw-the-infant-cry-curve"&gt;Sorry, Parents: New Research Shows That Infant Crying Doesn't Peak After 6 Weeks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has been established that NLP are reliable markers of the level of distress and/or pain expressed by the baby," Jean Monnet University bioacoustician Lény Lego and colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2025.0150"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results demonstrate that the level of NLP in a cry modulates the temporal dynamics of the facial thermal response in listeners, independent of their sex."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caregivers &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-to-tell-if-an-infant-is-crying-in-pain-or-just-a-cry-baby"&gt;can usually differentiate&lt;/a&gt; between cries of ordinary discomfort and those blood-curdling NLPs that signal serious pain, but it's unclear exactly how our bodies arrive at this higher-order cognitive effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team led by researchers from Jean Monnet University and the University of Saint-Etienne, both in France, wanted to know how these sounds affect adults' nervous systems on a subconscious level and the physiological effects they elicit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They tested the reactions of 41 participants (21 men, 20 women, aged 35 years old on average) to the sounds of babies crying. These adults listened to a selection of 23 audio tracks, recorded from 16 different infants while they were either experiencing the benign discomfort of a bath, or the pain of a vaccine jab at the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the participants listened, a thermal camera tracked changes to their face temperature. An increase in heat from this part of the body is a response from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system"&gt;autonomic nervous system,&lt;/a&gt; the largely unconscious part of our nervous system that controls internal body functions like heart rate, breathing, and digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After listening, the participants also reported whether they thought they had heard sounds of either discomfort or pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Variations in a listener's facial temperature, a marker of the autonomic emotional response, reflect the pain expressed by a baby's cry," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2025.0150"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cry with a higher level of NLP elicited a stronger flush response from listeners' faces, suggesting that these chaotic sounds are much more effective at getting the attention of adults, on a physiological level, than cries with little or no NLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This response to high-NLP cries was seen equally in male and female participants, adding to the researcher's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.06.076"&gt;previous findings&lt;/a&gt; that both sexes can reliably identify pain in a baby's cry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173504" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173504" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/GettyImages-640688675.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-173504" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/GettyImages-640688675.jpg 1000w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/GettyImages-640688675-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/GettyImages-640688675-622x415.jpg 622w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/GettyImages-640688675-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/GettyImages-640688675-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173504" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(Peter Cade/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While our results sound interesting and new, this study remains rather preliminary and raises a number of questions, both in terms of interpreting the results and from a methodological point of view," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2025.0150"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, the participants had little or no experience with babies, so these results don't necessarily reflect the physiological response of seasoned parents. Future studies could reveal how physiological responses to NLP differ based on experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also note the cries played in this study are natural sounds, a messy smorgasbord of acoustic phenomena. They're yet to unpack exactly which NLP elicit a thermal response, or if, perhaps, it's their unsettling combination that sends such a powerful SOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2025.0150"&gt;Journal of the Royal Society Interface&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

At 28, she had taken on a unit in Chester to convert into a yoga studio, poured in all her savings and hired teachers, while at the same time working as a personal trainer. Her days started at 5am; she was driven, stressed, excited, and had no time for the back pain that just would not subside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It kept moving around,” she says. “Every day it would be in a different part of my back. I was strapping on heat packs and ice packs just to get to work.” Smith saw her GP, her physiotherapist and a chiropractor, all of whom suspected a torn muscle. “What really worried me,” she says, “the worst-case scenario, was a slipped disc.” One day in March 2020, the pain was so intense that Smith took to her bed, fell asleep and woke with a crashing migraine and blurred vision. Her mum took her to the optician who shone a light behind Smith’s eyes, saw haemorrhaging and sent her straight to the hospital. Once there, Smith was admitted, and over the course of a week, had an MRI, a CT scan, and a biopsy taken from the cells in her back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"society","tags":[{"id":"society/lung-cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Lung cancer"},{"id":"society/cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Cancer"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"society/youngpeople","type":"Keyword","title":"Young people"},{"id":"environment/air-pollution","type":"Keyword","title":"Air pollution"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"profile/anna-moore","type":"Contributor","title":"Anna Moore"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/g2","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"G2"},{"id":"theguardian/g2/features","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Comment &amp;amp; features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-g2-features","type":"Tracking","title":"UK G2 Features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-g2-production","type":"Tracking","title":"UK G2 production"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"society/2025/sep/14/lung-cancer-young-fit-non-smoking-women","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Smith was alone in her bed when two doctors appeared, closed the curtains, and told her that she had cancer in her lungs that had spread down her spine and up into her brain. It was stage four. “They said there was nothing they could do for me,” says Smith. “All I remember is ringing my mum and screaming down the phone. The doctors told my parents that I probably had about two weeks to live.” This was the early days of Covid, and Smith chose to go home for palliative care. “I think I’ve blocked a lot of it out, as you do when you go through trauma,” says Smith. “My friends all came to say goodbye. They were sitting at the end of my bed crying their eyes out. I’ve still got a whole book of the letters they wrote me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="72976a7b-8a38-4cc5-8926-df6ead2255a9" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Becca Smith had planned to open a yoga studio before she became ill. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Handout&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For decades, lung cancer has been viewed as a disease of older men, a “smokers’ disease”, heavily stigmatised and until very recently, grossly underfunded. &lt;a href="https://www.icr.ac.uk/research-and-discoveries/cancer-blogs/detail/science-talk/let-s-work-together-to-end-the-stigma-around-lung-cancer#:~:text=The%20stigma%20around%20the%20disease,account%20the%20burden%20of%20disease." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;One analysis from 2010&lt;/a&gt; found it received only 6% of cancer research funding, despite being the &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/lung-cancer#lung_stats0" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;third most common cancer in the UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In recent years though, the patient profile has shifted. Smoking remains the main risk factor, but cases among fit, young, non-smoking women have risen, both as a proportion and in absolute numbers. And while screening is now available in England for those over 55 with a history of smoking – &lt;a href="https://roycastle.org/the-devil-is-in-the-detail-our-response-to-the-10-year-health-plan/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;76% of the lung cancer cases identified by screening are at stage one or two and &lt;/a&gt;potentially curable – young, non-smoking women like Smith tend to be diagnosed only after the cancer has spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Alex Georgiou, a consultant medical oncologist at Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospital, has analysed the data of his lung cancer patients to understand these changes. “Between 2010 and 2021, the number of patients at our clinic who haven’t smoked has increased every year,” he says. “In 2010, it was 5% of cases. By 2021, it was 14%.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Of these non-smoking lung cancer cases, 68% were women, compared with 43% of those with a history of smoking. There was also a higher proportion of younger patients: 16% of the non-smoking patients were aged below 50 compared with 5% from the smoking group – and more Black and Asian patients too. White people made up 72% of the smoking cases, compared with just 44% of the non-smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We might expect a high proportion of Asian patients, as non-smoking lung cancer is very prevalent in south-east Asia,” says Georgiou. “But the higher number of black patients is less recognised. They made up 17% of the non-smoking cases versus 5% from the group with a smoking history.” There were also clear differences in stage of presentation and disease progression. Two-thirds of the non-smoking patients presented at stage four, the most advanced stage, and 38% had cancer that had spread to the brain. “It’s not only that the demographics are different,” says Georgiou. “The biology of the cancer is different too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These findings reflect worldwide trends but, as yet, none of it is fully understood. According to Cecilia Pompili, a thoracic surgeon and clinical senior lecturer at Hull York Medical School, we are just beginning to ask the questions. “For so long, we didn’t think of lung cancer as a disease of young women and often haven’t even included them in clinical research trials,” she says. (For example, &lt;a href="https://www.lungcancerstoday.com/post/dr-narjust-florez-on-the-reality-of-lung-cancer-in-women" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;men have made up 65% of participants&lt;/a&gt; in groundbreaking immunotherapy trials for lung cancer.) Pompili is interviewing women with lung cancer about their early symptoms and diagnosis pathway, for a study funded by the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Adenocarcinoma is the most common lung cancer diagnosed in non-smokers, and while some women experience the “classic” persistent cough, and also coughing up blood, for others, symptoms are more vague and non-specific, such as weight loss, or back pain. “We want to understand the symptom trajectory and also whether women are treated differently by their health provider,” says Pompili. “We know from some patients that a 40-year-old, fit woman with a persistent cough is more likely to be diagnosed with an allergy, asthma or an infection than an older male smoker who will be sent for a chest X-ray.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Identifying why lung cancer is rising in women requires much more research, says Pompili. Hormones could play a part. Worldwide, indoor air pollution caused by wood-burning stoves and biomass fuels used for cooking and heating has been identified as a significant risk factor. In the UK, &lt;a href="https://roycastle.org/learn-about-lung-cancer/lung-cancer-risk-factors/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;outdoor air pollution is believed to cause around one in 10 lung cancers&lt;/a&gt;. “Air pollution has been demonstrated to be significant for both genders, especially in younger patients,” says Pompili. It’s possible that women’s smaller lungs and narrower airways lead to a higher concentration of pollutants and a greater likelihood of fine particulate matter – 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter – becoming trapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, whose nine-year-old daughter Ella was the first person in the world to have air pollution listed as a cause of death on her death certificate, is not surprised. “Ella had asthma but there are 700 diseases impacted by air pollution,” she says. “When I think of younger women with lung cancer, I wonder about the school run, the time sitting in cars or buses in heavy traffic. When I think about the higher number of black and brown people, I think of economics. Who takes buses, and waits at bus stops, and lives in social housing and cheaper housing close to main roads?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“London is the most congested city in Europe. Worldwide, we are number five,” continues Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, who campaigns for cleaner air through the &lt;a href="https://www.ellaroberta.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Ella Roberta Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. “Yet somehow, officially, Ella is still the only person who has died because of air pollution. We’ve got to the point where the burden of ill health caused by air pollution is so huge, I’m asking myself: ‘What will it take to make the public demand more action?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Also key here – but again, not fully understood – is the role of genetic mutations, especially in younger non-smoking women. Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are the most common, &lt;a href="https://www.egfrpositive.org.uk/what-is-egfr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;believed to cause 10-15% of lung cancers in the UK&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2022-09-10_scientists-reveal-how-air-pollution-can-cause-lung-cancer-in-people-who-have-never-smoked" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; has identified how air pollution might “wake up” dormant cells in the lungs that carry these cancer-causing mutations, promoting their growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sarah Li, a 42-year-old freelance film-maker, was diagnosed with EGFR-positive lung cancer last year. A non-smoker and a vegan, Li lives in London and was signed up for her seventh marathon at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I’d had a persistent cough but I wasn’t worried,” she says. “I’d had a cold first and the cough just seemed to come off the back of it.” Li was also experiencing pain in her right shoulder. “Looking back, that was another symptom but I didn’t know enough to join the dots.” A physio suggested shoulder exercises and a pharmacist sold Li syrup for her cough. After four months though, as the cough worsened, Li saw her GP, expecting antibiotics for a chest infection. Instead, she was referred for a chest X-ray, then fast-tracked for a CT scan. In April 2024, Li learned she had inoperable lung cancer, with a tumour on her left lung, and cancer also present in nodules in her right lung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Even now, I find it strange when I say I have lung cancer,” says Li. “I can say I have cancer – so many people get cancer – but the idea of lung cancer still feels quite foreign. How am I the face of lung cancer? When I was first diagnosed, I went through everything, asking: ‘Why? What did I do?’ I think I led a healthy lifestyle, but I lived in India for four years, in Hyderabad, a busy city. I feel strange blaming any one thing or focusing on what I might have done wrong. Nobody wants this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8bb545b7-c72b-42d1-bad6-a93d4588e814" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Sarah Li was diagnosed with lung cancer last year.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Although Li had only been with her partner Robin for 18 months, they had to have difficult conversations about fertility and future children. “Did I want to freeze my eggs before treatment? We decided it was better to keep me alive and start treatment as soon as possible.” In fact, the impact of lung cancer on fertility has only just become an area of research. The International Pregnancy and Lung &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Registry was launched in December 2023. “Understanding how lung cancer and its treatment impacts young women in all ways – their whole lives, their fertility, their young family and caring responsibilities, their career, is only just beginning,” says Pompili. “It’s something we have done for breast cancer – but not lung cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After years of underfunding (widely attributed to lung cancer’s link with smoking), pioneering treatments are developing fast – especially for cancers like Li’s, driven by genetic mutations. In the last decade, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has &lt;a href="https://www.nationalhealthexecutive.com/articles/nices-increasing-cancer-treatment-recommendations#:~:text=Since%202015%2C%20NICE%20has%20made,immune%20system%20to%20combat%20cancer." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommended 48 new treatments&lt;/a&gt; for lung cancer – six times more than in the previous decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Li’s first round of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy led to massive reductions in her tumours. However, in January, a small lesion was found on her brain. She is now having a targeted therapy – a daily pill – and more chemo. “Life is more intense now,” she says. “There’s more vividness to everything. Like today, I’m just so happy that I’m feeling well enough to be outside, to have a nice lunch. Those little things you take for granted … you’re just way more appreciative of it all. The idea of talking about ‘two years’ time’ or ‘five years’ time’ like my friends do? I can’t. I know that eventually the cancer will outsmart the treatment I’m on. Hopefully, by then, there’ll be another treatment pathway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Smith is in the same position. A few weeks into her palliative care, the family were informed by phone that the biopsy taken from Smith’s back showed a genetic mutation, ALK-positive lung cancer, and a treatment was available. She began taking eight tablets a day – targeted cancer drugs, ALK inhibitors – with monthly blood tests and scans every three months. “It went well, there was a big reduction in cancer,” she says. “After two years, I got some progression in my brain, so I’m on the second line of treatment now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Explaining her disease to others is exhausting. “You always get the same reaction,” she says. “‘But you don’t smoke?’ ‘You’re so young?’ There’s such a community around breast cancer – more power to it – but with lung cancer, there really isn’t. It feels like it’s just you.” This is despite the fact that the disease &lt;a href="https://www.lungcancerresearchfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/Women-Fact-Sheet-2024.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;kills as many women&lt;/a&gt; as breast, ovarian and cervical cancers combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Smith is a pilates teacher now – this summer, she went on a yoga retreat in Bali. Her partner, Sammy, flew out to join her in July and, during a walk on the beach, he proposed. “This is my dream. I’m enjoying my life,” she says. “I’ve gone through so much. I lost the yoga studio, I lost a lot of money, but the things you think matter? They really don’t. All I care about is my family and friends, and being happy and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I still feel sadness and I’m scared – I’m terrified because I don’t know what’s to come,” she continues. “Scans never get easier, but you get better at dealing with them. It’s a cliche but I genuinely live for today now – and five years on, I’ve finally reached a stage where I can be grateful for that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxOa2dBWngtTDM2Q2hnc0kzNXI4UE9OVzcwS1ZGQmpFQjNYenI0X0xVZkp6bnp4QVYzWHdJVkJEOFU4c3otVWw5WHBMNzF6MHB3SEcxSWFHN1FGYnA5Yk9WNTBYdGc2amdIN0sxSnVoUU9lYWlaUlNDeXBfd0VMY0xvTEN0M1FtLWJUSmdLNWdSczY</guid></item><item><title>现在每个人都有一个中国肽经销商-旧金山标准</title><link>https://sfstandard.com/2025/09/14/everyone-has-chinese-peptide-dealer-now/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-grid article-content"&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;On an August morning, among the marble columns and Tuscan frescoes in the Fairmont Hotel’s Laurel Court restaurant, a back table became an impromptu chemistry class. Lynne Ji, a slim 27-year-old dressed in black athleisure, moved aside a china teapot, unzipped a black business-class airline pouch, and tipped an array of glass vials onto the table. They contained powdered and liquid versions of the peptide retatrutide, a next-generation GLP-1 compound made by pharma giant Eli Lilly, currently in &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05931367"&gt;Phase 3 clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. It was getting a lot of buzz in her group chats, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Ji, a retired poker pro who dabbles in crypto, began microdosing retatrutide in February. Within days, she said, her “food noise” faded, her portions shrank, and her weight dropped from 135 to 115 pounds. “I am exactly vain enough to inject myself to look thinner,” she said. “I played poker for a career, so taking risks doesn’t bother me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Ji’s stash didn’t come from a pharmacy but from a Chinese peptide dealer she’d been connected to on WhatsApp by tech friends. She paid the guy $195 for 10 vials. “Three weeks later, it shows up at your door,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="ImageBlock_ImageFigure__ZnquR grid-full inset-image mobile-grid-full mobile-grid-full" data-align="full"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="basis-full mt-[10px] text-xs text-gray-550 font-inter leading-[18px] "&gt;A growing number of techies are injecting Chinese peptides for their purported health benefits, from improving libido to fat loss.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Ji’s approach to DIY dosing is part of a growing Bay Area trend that’s evolving beyond psychedelics and nootropics into needles and peptide stacks. This cohort of mostly tech industry people are injecting research-grade peptides in hopes of a health or performance boost to address everything from fat loss and recovery to focus and libido. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;A few years ago, most people didn’t know a peptide from a protein shake. Then came &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/public-health/prevention-wellness/spending-glp-1s-has-grown-dramatically-here-are-details"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, which turned GLP-1s (glucagon-like peptides, originally designed to treat diabetes but repurposed for weight loss) into a household name. Serena Williams shills GLP-1s for the telehealth brand &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://ro.co/lp/weight-loss/quiz/serena/"&gt;Ro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, and&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;SF-based telehealth company Hims &amp;amp; Hers advertises microdosing GLP-1s on Muni buses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;But GLP-1s, which mimic gut hormones to help regulate blood sugar, are only one branch of peptides, which are strings of amino acids that build proteins and act on certain cell types to change functions in the body. You’ll find peptides in &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11762834/"&gt;luxury&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; skincare serums and oral supplements, but doctors consider injection the gold standard for efficacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Enthusiasts stock up on peptides like BPC-157 (“body protection compound”) for &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6271067/"&gt;tendon and ligament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; healing; GHK-Cu, a copper peptide believed to &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6073405/"&gt;increase collagen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; and hair growth; &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7747025/"&gt;Thymosin alpha-1 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;(TA-1) for immune support; Selank to reduce &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-psychiatry/article/p1114-rapid-and-slow-response-during-treatment-of-generalized-anxiety-disorder-with-peptide-anxiolytic-selank/7A497218D37084BD079EFE143126F56E"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;; and Semax, &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10218113/"&gt;developed for stroke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; recovery, for a brain boost. Some of these health claims are supported by small studies; others by little more than message-board testimonials. Regardless, for some DIY health experimenters, the term “peptide” has become synonymous with quick fixes and radical life upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="!p-0 !m-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;That DIY culture is colliding with a regulatory crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="ImageBlock_ImageFigure__ZnquR grid-full inset-image mobile-grid-full mobile-grid-full" data-align="full"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="basis-full mt-[10px] text-xs text-gray-550 font-inter leading-[18px] "&gt;Superpower co-founder Max Marchione prepares a copper peptide injection from China at the company office in San Francisco. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Starting in 2023, the Food and Drug Administration began steadily restricting access to &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://a4pc.org/news/2023-10/fda-puts-some-peptides-off-limits"&gt;popular&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; peptides, moving several — including BPC-157, CJC-1295, and ipamorelin, which were formerly available from U.S. compounding pharmacies — into its &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/human-drug-compounding/certain-bulk-drug-substances-use-compounding-may-present-significant-safety-risks"&gt;“Category 2 bucket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” shorthand for bulk substances that “may present significant safety risks” like poor immune responses, and shouldn’t be compounded. (Some were removed from that list in &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/october-29-2024-meeting-pharmacy-compounding-advisory-committee-10292024"&gt;2024.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Health and Human Services secretary, has tweeted complaints about the FDA’s &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1849925311586238737"&gt;war on peptides&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. But that has not led to any change to regulations or availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Health hackers have turned to the gray market to source their  vials from dealers in China, where most peptides are manufactured. These dealers sell vials labeled “not for human use.” Purchasing this way amounts to a regulatory hack that opens the Chinese supply chain to anyone with a credit card, under the fiction that the drugs are for laboratory use only. Chinese peptide imports from non-FDA registered companies rose 44% from December to January, according to the Partnership for Safe Medicines, a nonprofit &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.safemedicines.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PSM-White-Paper-v1-PUBLIC-VERSION.pdf"&gt;watchdog.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Representatives for the FDA declined to comment but directed The Standard to the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/fdas-concerns-unapproved-glp-1-drugs-used-weight-loss"&gt;agency’s website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; Concerns with Unapproved GLP-1 Drugs Used for Weight Loss, which warns against purchasing peptides labeled “for research purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="ImageBlock_ImageFigure__ZnquR  inset-image mobile-grid-full mobile-grid-full" data-align="none"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="basis-full mt-[10px] text-xs text-gray-550 font-inter leading-[18px] "&gt;Are peptides in the startup fridge the new company perk?&lt;span class="image-caption-divider"&gt; | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;&lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;Source: &lt;/span&gt;Jason Henry for The Standard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Despite peptides being one of pop culture’s buzziest words right now – alongside Labubu and matcha —  they’re not a new phenomena. Peptides were discovered in humans in the 1920s, but it wasn’t until breakthrough synthesizing techniques were developed in the 1950s that scientists began studying their use in treating disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Thousands have been cataloged, and around 100 peptide-based drugs have made it to market, with 150 in active clinical trials. “Peptides are super important,” said pathology professor Katrin J. Svensson, who runs a &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://svenssonlabstanford.org"&gt;metabolic regulation lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; at Stanford University.  “They often have fewer side effects than other types of drugs.” Since peptides are already present in the body, adding more is considered low risk, she added..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Research-grade peptides usually arrive as powders that require dilution with bacteriostatic water. But what shows up in the mail is anyone’s guess. “There is no regulation on the purity,” said Svensson. “It’s pretty dangerous.” Risks range from accidental overdose due to inconsistent labelling to vomiting and severe dehydration, or even sepsis, “if mixed in unsterile conditions,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Even the first step, mixing, can be dicey, Svennsson warned; the math behind the dilution process, referred to as reconstitution, is complex enough to spawn countless online “peptide calculators.” Eyeballing a vial isn’t enough. “Holding the bottle up to the light doesn’t mean it’s actually dissolved,” she said. “You need an instrument to determine this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Tim Fitzgerald, who runs the &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hocwc.com"&gt;Human Optimization Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, a wellness spa in Walnut Creek offering cryotherapy, red-light therapy, and other treatments, began using peptides in 2016 after suffering a herniated disc and autoimmune issues he attributed to “vaccine injuries.” Within weeks, his pain was gone, he claims. He emphasizes lifestyle changes — “protein, training, sleep, light — all of it matters” — alongside “use as needed” peptide injections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“It’s not a magic bullet,” he said. “Someone who’s a metabolic dumpster fire isn’t going to get the result just by hopping on a shot.” He has cycled through a few types of peptides; treating a condition called “small intestine bacterial overgrowth,” (SIBO), a concussion, and muscle healing. Recently, though, he took a break: “I was starting to feel a bit like a human pin cushion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading-block article-body text-left"&gt;The Peptide bros&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="ImageBlock_ImageFigure__ZnquR grid-wide inset-image mobile-grid-full mobile-grid-full" data-align="wide"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="basis-full mt-[10px] text-xs text-gray-550 font-inter leading-[18px] "&gt;Marchione holding peptides from China he keeps in a fridge.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Max Marchione, the baby-faced 25-year-old cofounder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/11/04/new-tech-flex-longevity-concierge/" data-post-id="5fee25af-e32f-4d50-9448-6fcef0b4ab28"&gt;Superpower&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, a telehealth-for-longevity startup based in SoMa, isn’t fazed by the needles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Before the company moved offices in September, the communal fridge doubled as a pharmacy. Mornings began with a ritual: Marchione lifting his shirt to swab his abs, cofounder Jacob Peters dropping trou to swab his butt, and Shaun Miller, the vice president of medical operations, alternating between hip and backside. (“I didn’t know people injected anywhere else,” said Peters.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Marchione started with peptides a few months ago but is already an evangelist. “All that matters is if I increase performance, even if it introduces a bit of short-term risk,” he reasoned, focusing on improvements in sleep, muscle gain, cognition, and immunity. “If that improves performance, it justifies it long term.” What hooked him was the contrast with supplements, which he could swallow daily and still feel no shift in energy, focus, or recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;As none of his preferred peptides are approved by the FDA, Marchione buys products labeled “for research use only.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“I get them from a Chinese peptide dealer,” he said. He’d prefer to source them domestically. “When you make something that people want hard to get, you create a black market,” said Miller. “The sentiment went from ‘I have my favorite compounding pharmacy’ to ‘I have my Chinese peptide dealer.’ If the supply wasn’t restricted, people would still be going the legitimate path.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Miller’s $1,000-a-month peptide stack is small change next to Peters’ $5,000 (“It’s a lot of money, but it’s such a massive ROI,” said Peters.) and Miller’s $2,000. (Biohackers have a nickname for Miller’s four daily injections: the “Wolverine Stack.”) Marchione’s stack includes two shots in the morning and one at night, with others on an ad hoc basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="  "&gt;&lt;p class="flex justify-center "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;As the hype over peptide efficacy outruns the data, Marchione has become an unexpected source of info for the community. His phone pings at all hours with sourcing and dosing questions from founders and investors. While The Standard watched, he pulled up a photo of a New York friend’s freezer jammed with tiny, color-capped vials. “That’s probably $100,000 to $250,000 worth of peptides,” he said. “Maybe more, in retail value. You gotta get on the peptide train.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Hence the emergence of Superpower’s Peptide Friday. In June, the company began doling out syringes alongside coffee at its weekly all-hands breakfast for the 20 to 30 employees who work in the office. The lineup has included thymosin alpha-1 (often dubbed by fans as an “immune booster”) and NAD, a coenzyme known for supporting cellular repair. “It started as a joke,” said Marchione. But the company’s roughly 150 employees are into the free peptide shots, said VP of operations Adam Small, noting that it’s a good way to get more folks to come into the office to work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Many purchasers of gray-market Chinese peptides have complained about the wildly varying quality. This infuriated Michael Carter, the San Francisco-based founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://Play.co"&gt;Play.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, a mobile gaming startup. After he re-injured his back in 2024, friends suggested peptides. He felt a lot better but hated buying from a sketchy website. “I don’t want to inject some crazy thing,” he said. “You’re opting out of the FDA, but you don’t want to opt out of supply chain safety.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;In March, he launched &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.finnrick.com/"&gt;Finnrick,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; a peptide-testing platform backed by AngelList founder Naval Ravikant; Cameron Teitelman of StartX, Stanford University’s innovation accelerator; and Walter Kortschak, a venture capitalist and early investor in Lyft, Robinhood, and Palantir. “I made the investment in the belief this is a rapidly growing market,” said Kortschak. “Having more transparency [provides] great benefits to everyone.” Consumers mail in their vials, and the samples get sent to labs for free testing (similar labs &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://janoshik.com/pricing/"&gt;charge fees)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; of purity, quantity, and potency. Finnrick also buys batches itself, taking steps to conceal its identity from the sellers. For each sample, the verdict comes back — a grade of A through E, with A the best — and is published online. Paid subscribers get extra analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Finnrick has tested 2,378 samples (with another 1,500 in the queue) of 15 types of peptides from 122 vendors. The lab found zero semaglutide in five of the six vials tested from one vendor, and the sixth had 5% extra product, which could lead to accidental overdosing (earning that company an E grade).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="  "&gt;&lt;p class="flex justify-center "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“We get emails from vendors demanding we take the data down,” said Carter. He doesn’t. The project doesn’t make unapproved drugs safe, but it makes the risk more legible. “Everyone has a peptide guy,” he said. “What people need is transparent information so they can make their own decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="ImageBlock_ImageFigure__ZnquR grid-wide inset-image mobile-grid-full mobile-grid-full" data-align="wide"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Not everyone is sourcing their peptides themselves. Some concierge doctors offer non-FDA-approved peptides via overseas channels, domestic “research use only” sellers, or via the small number of compounding pharmacies allowed to serve licensed clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“I’m only as good as my compounder,” said Dr. Bronwyn Holmes, a San Francisco specialist  in anti-aging and pediatrics who sits on the medical advisory board at Eden Health, a telehealth platform. Holmes has prescribed peptides since 2018, often BPC-157 and thymosin for women recovering from cosmetic surgery and GLP-1s for weight loss. Around 20% of her weight-loss patients are on retatrutide, the investigational peptide. “I see an uptick in, ‘Hey, I saw this on a podcast. What do you think?’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Dr. &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://drmolly.co/"&gt;Molly Maloof&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, a Bay Area physician who has lectured at Stanford University and specializes in treating tech executives, is all in on mainstreaming peptides. “I’m bullish, because I believe peptides are medicine for health and not just disease,” she said. “We’re going to see a lot of the gray market become the white market in the next decade.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Maloof has a proactive approach to peptides: “I don’t recommend anything to patients I haven’t tested myself,” she said, describing four daily injections. The standout has been Selank, an &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5322660/"&gt;anti-anxiety peptide,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; designed to calm the nervous system without sedation while potentially boosting focus and memory.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“My god. You definitely notice a major shift — your brain just feels smooth,” she said. “It’s so nice.” To source quality peptides, Maloof visits labs, verifies supply chains, and pushes chemists for proof via batch numbers, test methods, and results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;But Maloof and Holmes are concierge doctors with concierge pricing. For people without sufficient money or connections, the fallback is usually a sketchy website they heard about on a podcast. A thirtysomething San Francisco-based engineer told me they flew to Mexico for injections “from a witch.” Another sourced a dealer via Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="  "&gt;&lt;p class="flex justify-center "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="floats"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;Ji, the retired poker player, doesn’t pretend peptides are risk-free. “I’m almost certain this is not a miracle drug that has zero long-term damage,” she said of microdosed retatrutide. She has also tried semaglutide and BPC-157. She worries friends are taking unnecessarily high doses. But for the most part, the curiosity outpaces the concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;“Under 20% of my friends do it,” she said. A higher number have pulled the trigger on peptide purchases, but not on the syringe. “They mentally put it on hold. They don’t really care, as they’re in pretty good shape. But they’re curious, so…” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left"&gt;So now they have a peptide guy, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div
