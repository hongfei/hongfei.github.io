      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"Antidepressants aren't cures for mental illnesses! They help, but you still need to do therapy in order to help with your mental health.

The same applies to the brain with mental illnesses."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Working in mental health, I often have people telling me that they're on medication for their mental health, so they don't need therapy (and vice versa) when &lt;b&gt;the most effective treatment for mental illnesses is a &lt;a href="https://bestmindbh.com/blog/how-do-medications-and-psychotherapy-work-together-the-life-changing-benefits-of-combining-medication-and-therapy/" target="_blank"&gt;combination&lt;/a&gt; of therapy and medication.&lt;/b&gt; For the bulk of people, they won't need to be on medication forever, either; it's just to help them through this tough stage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Anonymous, 31, Australia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;b&gt;Severe mental illness is unlikely to be 'cured.'&lt;/b&gt; Recovery is not a black and white thing. Recovery is a gradual thing that looks different for each person. It could be unrealistic to expect your loved one, or yourself, to live exactly the same life as before the onset. But it's also unrealistic to think life with a severe mental illness can't be active and rewarding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Anonymous, Early 30s, California&lt;/p&gt;

And that's why taking magnesium oxide supplements was found to have lots of benefits, according to the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;These included reducing lower tummy pain, bloating, straining - and making it easier to poo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Regarding probiotics, the guidelines suggest some types can improve some symptoms but there is also a lack of research on the impact of many different probiotic strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Up until now, guidance for doctors treating patients with constipation has been limited and outdated, and focused on advice to increase dietary fibre and water intake, say the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The new recommendations are based on evidence from 75 clinical trials - all those available - which have been analysed by a panel of experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Prof Kevin Whelan, senior research author and professor of dietetics at KCL, said the new guidance "marks a promising step towards empowering health professionals and their patients to manage constipation through diet". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He said this meant people suffering from constipation could now access up-to-date advice to help improve their symptoms, wellbeing and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The British Dietetic Association, which funded the project to produce the new guidelines, said they were an excellent resource for dietitians, doctors and nurses, and supported "a more diet-focused and evidence-based approach to the management of chronic constipation".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The research and the new guidelines are published in the Journal of Human Nutrition &amp;amp; Dietetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 16:24:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9iRUsyVkVYNnBRUFlTSjBWb3h4VHd5aWNWMHliNlhOUUhFVFlOTF9QWHlpajBCY0pna0FMRVh1SUJUNWFUU1QxYnBWb2xmRXNVODN4TVlYeGlDQdIBX0FVX3lxTE5MMVIySjNOVkRoYlU1MGZob0RxbzdaSXlwa3J1WDBDcEY5eVlMdGFnOWQtNEp0SE5SX09scGhLZ1F3eVktbGJSVjYzbFFiRU9oNDR3RmdWT0NhQ2JyallB</guid></item><item><title>与大麻使用相关的基因揭示了与心理健康的关系-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/genetics-cannabis-mental-health-29804/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers analyzing data from over 130,000 participants have identified specific genes associated with cannabis use and its frequency, revealing strong links to psychiatric, cognitive, and physical health traits. The genes CADM2 and GRM3, already known for roles in brain communication and impulsivity, appear central to how individuals initiate and sustain cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also uncovered dozens of other genes tied to risk-taking, schizophrenia, and chronic illnesses such as diabetes and coronary artery disease. These findings could lead to new prevention strategies and potential therapeutic targets for cannabis use disorder, which currently has no approved drug treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Key Genes:&lt;/strong&gt; Cannabis use is linked to CADM2 and GRM3, genes involved in brain signaling and impulsivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Health Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Genetic predisposition for cannabis use overlaps with over 100 psychiatric, cognitive, and physical traits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventive Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could inform personalized strategies to predict and prevent cannabis use disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University of California San Diego of Medicine researchers, in collaboration with the genetic testing company 23andMe, have identified regions of the human genome associated with cannabis use, uncovering new relationships with psychiatric, cognitive and physical health&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings may inform the development of prevention and treatment strategies for cannabis use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113344"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain, DNA, and leaves." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/cud-genetics-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;There are currently no FDA-approved drug therapies to treat cannabis use disorder. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published on October 13, 2025 in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis is widely used, but its long-term effects on health remain poorly characterized,” said Sandra Sanchez-Roige, Ph.D., associate professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were also interested in the relationship between genetics and traits that contribute to the development of cannabis use disorder, which can interfere with a person’s daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While most people who try cannabis do not go on to develop cannabis use disorder, some studies estimate that nearly 30% will,” said Sanchez-Roige.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding the genetics of early-stage behaviors may help clarify who is at greater risk, opening the door to prevention and intervention strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyzing relationships between cannabis use and genetic data provided by 131,895 23andMe research participants. They answered survey questions about whether or not they had ever used cannabis, and those who answered yes were also asked how frequently they used the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve known for decades that genetic factors influence whether or not people will try drugs, how frequently they use those drugs, and the risk that they will become addicted to them,” said Abraham A. Palmer, Ph.D., professor and vice chair for basic research in the department of psychiatry at UC San Diego School of Medicine and co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Genetic tools like GWAS help us identify the molecular systems that connect cannabis use to brain function and behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that lifetime cannabis use was associated with two genes. The first was Cell Adhesion Molecule 2 (&lt;em&gt;CADM2&lt;/em&gt;), a gene involved in cell assembly and in signaling between nerve cells, particularly in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have linked &lt;em&gt;CADM2&lt;/em&gt; to various traits and conditions, including impulsive personality, obesity and cancer metastasis. Frequency of cannabis use was also found to be associated with the &lt;em&gt;CADM2&lt;/em&gt; gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second gene was Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 3 (&lt;em&gt;GRM3&lt;/em&gt;), which is involved in communication between neurons and long-term brain plasticity. &lt;em&gt;GRM3&lt;/em&gt; has already been linked to psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We showed that the genetics of cannabis use — both trying it and using it more often — are tied to the genetics of other psychiatric traits, cognitive measures, and even physical health problems,” said Sanchez-Roige.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A secondary analysis revealed an additional 40 genes associated with lifetime cannabis use and four genes associated with frequency of cannabis use. Twenty-nine of these genes had not previously been associated with cannabis-related traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then analyzed which health conditions were correlated with a genetic predisposition for cannabis use. They analyzed thousands of traits in two large independent datasets from the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) &lt;em&gt;All of Us Research Program&lt;/em&gt; and Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s biobank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the genome, lifetime cannabis use and frequency of cannabis use were genetically correlated with more than 100 different traits including psychiatric conditions (e.g., schizophrenia, ADHD, anxiety and depression), cognitive traits (e.g., executive function and risk-taking) and physical health (e.g., diabetes, chronic pain and coronary artery disease).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were also associated with an increased risk for tobacco use, infectious diseases including HIV and viral hepatitis, and autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is one of the first genome-wide association studies to examine behaviors that precede cannabis use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis use exists on a continuum,” said first author Hayley Thorpe, Ph.D., a visiting scholar in Sanchez-Roige’s lab and postdoctoral researcher at Western University. “By studying these intermediate traits, we can begin to map how genetic risk unfolds before cannabis use disorder develops.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are currently no FDA-approved drug therapies to treat cannabis use disorder. The authors hope that the biological discoveries generated by GWAS will support future efforts to identify therapeutic targets and preventative interventions against the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional co-authors on the study include: John J. Meredith, Mariela V. Jennings, Renata B. Cupertino, Shreya Pakala, UC San Diego; Pierre Fontanillas, Sarah L. Elson and the 23andMe Research Team at 23andMe, Inc.; Jibran Y.

We performed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of lifetime (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 131,895) and frequency (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 73,374) of cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For lifetime cannabis use, we identified two loci, one near &lt;em&gt;CADM2&lt;/em&gt; (rs35827242, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 4.63E-12) and another near &lt;em&gt;GRM3&lt;/em&gt; (rs12673181, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 6.90E-09).

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are thousands of different types of chili peppers, with some estimates suggesting over 4,000 varieties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the 2020 study, the researchers noted that the type of chili pepper and amount consumed was variable among the studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research involved a meta‑analysis of four large observational studies comparing people who consumed chili pepper vs. those who rarely or never did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The individual studies were based on self‑reported diet and chili consumption (not controlled interventions), and the amount, type, or frequency of chili pepper use was not standardized across the studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This made it difficult to draw conclusions about exactly how much, how often and which type of chili pepper consumption may be associated with health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senior author Dr Bo Xu, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic's Heart, Vascular &amp;amp; Thoracic Institute in Cleveland, Ohio, said at the time that the findings highlighted that 'dietary factors may play an important role in overall health'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'The exact reasons and mechanisms that might explain our findings, though, are currently unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Therefore, it is impossible to conclusively say that eating more chili pepper can prolong life and reduce deaths, especially from cardiovascular factors or cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'More research, especially evidence from randomized controlled studies, is needed to confirm these preliminary findings.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research has suggested regularly eating chilis may protect against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Previous studies have found the food has an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer and blood-glucose regulating effect due to capsaicin, which gives chili pepper its characteristic spice (stock) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate 2020 study in mice by scientists in Canada found that feeding them treats made with capsaicin protected against the formation of amyloid plaques, the harmful deposits thought to be responsible for the symptoms of Alzheimer’s, including memory loss and mood swings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the journal Translational Psychiatry, the researchers said, as well as blocking plaque formation, capsaicin appeared to dampen down inflammation in the brain, also linked to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chili peppers aren't the first or only food Johnson promotes. He is also a big advocate of extra virgin olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He&lt;span&gt; has said he consumes a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil with every meal, every day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The 48-year-old (pictured, right, with his son) claims to be more than a decade younger biologically than his actual age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a YouTube video the health influencer listed what the criteria is to meet the standards for extra virgin olive oil to be beneficial for health, with it needing to be cold pressed, containing polyphenols, oleic acid, third-party testing, harvest date and UV protectant. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Healthline, extra virgin olive oil is nutritious and contains powerful antioxidants, as well as strong anti-inflammatory properties and may help reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and fight Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When you eat it causes damage in your body,' Johnson explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I recently learned it myself, and so EVOO is protective against that damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Studies show improvements in weight management, blood pressure, blood sugar levels, cholesterol, heart health, brain health and mood.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He claimed: 'The scientific evidence is compelling, [and] extra virgin olive oil is in an elite category.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 15:38:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOdUZUYXhOZWtYVDc1Qmljb0RUZmc4UFFxYjQzVXJmSzdia0VGY0RFQzF4aUVNSk9YVDNQTzdXV3AycWJTNThzVGVUS2JIbWhBNmppdl9ZeFI1amtpdURTeXlramFPMmFEcjB3dXI5X1NnZUFkQXR5N281djd0elpNb0VNS19hb2h1X1ZsYmUwYjlyekdvczJLOUJ3OEdLOHI3amRpMC04RdIBrAFBVV95cUxNWVhSSXJnbjJ0bWtsQ25YU25YcjRpdldpUEVTTklkNDJsYkQ5QUlRczh1THZZaE0yTVU4dnlIQmRLTFd5bldYNEJoRXhHbGhIdklzQnB0Vk1rWk9hM0o0MVdSZWhaQVZfVlo5Q1FLeng3enFIRDlBQ1Vwa3BoLU5zaU5FVjJHRXBRRFI3bDNwMUNkWm1vTTBMYWFwZ1ZMc1I5bDJDbktLTUpoWTND</guid></item><item><title>为什么人们使用大麻或对大麻上瘾？一项新的研究提供了线索。-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/10/13/cannabis-marijuana-addiction-genes-study/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7AD2W4E55NB2LFDDRAKNJOYWV4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The tendency to use cannabis is associated with genes linked to impulsive behavior, obesity, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, among other traits, according to a study released Monday by researchers at the University of California at San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 15:17:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQQTYtakE3U3Q1d2dFaXBQWG94Mjg0ZEt4Q1ptZlJZNkV5RVItT0VveGg0ZXYyWHg0bXVib3FyZ0x3M0p1RHBpQTdRTFBfNGdhSTZnYzRXNVhaRDBUQk9oZkgwb2d2OVZfZFl3eXdqX3VWV1pocWRRcWN5SUhGNjAwZWM1ZHJqYjEtVnJUZ0RwZXlmZUxI</guid></item><item><title>一项研究显示，使用社交媒体的孩子在阅读和记忆测试中的得分较低- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/13/nx-s1-5571050/social-media-teens-brains-reading-memory</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Preteens using increasing amounts of social media perform poorer in reading, vocabulary and memory tests in early adolescence compared with those who use no or little social media. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's according to a new study that suggests a link between social media use and poorer cognition in teens. The &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.16613?guestAccessKey=c8bce59a-f799-4c36-817e-dd2c05cf6ae4&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=101325" target="_blank"&gt;findings are published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is a really exciting study," says psychologist &lt;a href="https://mitch.web.unc.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Mitch Prinstein&lt;/a&gt; at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who wasn't involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"It confirms a lot of what we have been hearing about from schools all across the country, which is that kids are just having a really hard time focusing on being able to learn as well as they used to, because of the ways in which social media has changed their ability to process information, perhaps."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While most previous research has focused on the impact of social media use on kids' mental health, "it's critical to understand how social media use during school hours specifically affects learning, especially as so many schools are considering phone bans right now," says study author and pediatrician &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/jason.nagata" target="_blank"&gt;Jason Nagata&lt;/a&gt; of the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A look at reading and memory &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To understand that, Nagata and his colleagues used data from one of the largest ongoing studies on adolescents, called the &lt;a href="https://abcdstudy.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists have been following thousands of preteens as they go through adolescence to understand the development of their brains.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The ongoing study has been surveying kids about their social media use every year and giving them a range of tests for learning and memory every other year. Nagata and his colleagues used data on over 6,000 children, ages 9 to 10, as scientists followed them through early adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They classified the kids into three groups based on their evolving patterns of social media use. The biggest group, consisting of about 58% of the kids, used little or no social media over the next few years. The second-largest group, about 37% of kids, started out with low-level use of social media, but by the time they turned 13, they were spending about an hour each day on social media. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The remaining 6% of kids — called the "high increasing social media group" — were spending about three or more hours a day by age 13.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"The dosage effect"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;All the groups were given a range of tests to measure their cognitive functioning at the start of the study and in early adolescence. For example, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7659464/" target="_blank"&gt;oral reading recognition test&lt;/a&gt; examined their reading and vocabulary skills. Another test, called the &lt;a href="https://nihtoolbox.org/test/picture-vocabulary-test/" target="_blank"&gt;picture vocabulary test&lt;/a&gt;, had them match the right pictures to words they heard.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What was notable actually to me and perhaps surprising was that even the low [increasing] social media users, so those who had about one hour a day by age 13, did perform on average 1 to 2 points lower on the reading and memory tasks compared to the non-social media users," says Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And the high increasing group performed up to 4 to 5 points lower than the non-social media users.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So those who had the highest social media use have lower scores," notes Nagata, "but even the low users had smaller differences in their cognitive scores."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That really speaks to the dosage effect of these [apps]," says psychologist &lt;a href="https://madiganlab.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Sheri Madigan&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Calgary, who wrote an &lt;a href="https://media.jamanetwork.com/wp-content/handlers/downloader.php?a=119641" target="_blank"&gt;accompanying editorial &lt;/a&gt;for the study. "It's problematic at really high uses, but it's also problematic at even in small doses."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While a difference of a few points in test scores may seem insignificant, "it's important to understand that kids are a moving target," explains Prinstein, who is also &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/about/apa/senior-staff/prinstein-bio" target="_blank"&gt;chief of psychology strategy and integration&lt;/a&gt; at the American Psychological Association.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Even a slight change in what they look like after a short period of time means that they're kind of now pointed on a trajectory that is different from others. That means that two, three, five years from now, we might be talking about some very significant gaps between kids who might have been heavy users or not as heavy users."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/10/10-facts-about-teens-and-social-media/" target="_blank"&gt;other recent research&lt;/a&gt; shows that hours on social media increase later in adolescence, notes Nagata. "We would expect that when they hit age 15, 16, 17, their use will be much higher," which might lead to even larger gaps in cognition and learning in later years, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In earlier studies, Nagata's team has used the same data from the ABCD Study and found other disturbing trends among underage social media users.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They &lt;a href="https://www.academicpedsjnl.net/article/S1876-2859(25)00009-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;found that a majority of kids&lt;/a&gt; — nearly two-thirds — start using social media before they turn 13, with the average user having three social media accounts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They also found &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9243697/" target="_blank"&gt;high levels of addiction-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt; with smartphones among 10-to-14-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Half the kids who had smartphones said that they lose track of how much time they're using their phone," says Nagata. "A quarter who are using social media say they use social media to forget about their problems. And 11% say that social media use has negatively affected their schoolwork."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;An important time for brain development&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Adolescence is a critical period for brain development, notes Prinstein, when the brain is fine-tuning its architecture based on experiences.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"After the first year of life, the adolescent period is the time where we see the most growth and the biggest reorganization of the brain in our lifetimes," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2799812" target="_blank"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;, Prinstein and his colleagues found that teens who are heavy social media users have brains that are more attuned to an existence on social media, with its "rapid, constant feedback," says Prinstein. "What we're finding is that kids become hypersensitive to the kinds of likes, comments, feedback and rewards they might get from peers."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those findings help explain the results of the new studies, he adds. "It makes perfect sense that if their brain is growing to be optimized for social media activities, it might not be optimized for other things they need to do, like we saw in the [new] study."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The new study also "gives us good-enough evidence that we really need to create some policies that are really specific around creating age limits, for example, on social media apps," says Madigan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Denmark announced last week that it plans to enforce a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/08/tech/denmark-children-social-media-ban-scli-intl" target="_blank"&gt;social media ban for users under age 15&lt;/a&gt;, she notes. Australia is requiring social media companies to "take reasonable steps to prevent Australians under the age of 16 from creating or keeping an account" starting December 2025.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Madigan hopes other countries will take note. "I think that we'll see a trickle effect on that. That's going to be really beneficial for kids."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every dolphin studied from Florida’s Indian River Lagoon had a brain toxin called 2,4-DAB.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Toxin levels were roughly 3,000 times higher during summer algal bloom months.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Dolphins’ brains showed the same Alzheimer’s-related proteins and gene activity seen in humans.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Scientists say these animals may be warning us about neurotoxin risks in warming coastal waters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIAMI —&lt;/strong&gt; Less than 200 miles from Miami-Dade County, the place with the highest number of Alzheimer’s patients in America, dolphins are washing up dead with brains full of toxins and riddled with the same disease signatures. Scientists say these marine mammals may be sounding an alarm about coastal waters that millions of people depend on for food and recreation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Florida’s &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/dolphins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bottlenose dolphins&lt;/a&gt; have long been considered sentinels for environmental dangers that could affect people. As long-lived mammals at the top of the food chain, they accumulate toxins the same way humans do when eating seafood. Now, research published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-08796-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reveals that 20 dolphins stranded along Florida’s Indian River Lagoon between 2010 and 2019 all tested positive for a brain toxin called 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (2,4-DAB). Their brains showed the genetic and physical hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The proximity raises questions. Miami-Dade County recorded the highest prevalence of people living with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; in the United States in 2024. Whether there’s any connection between human cases and what’s happening to dolphins in nearby waters remains unknown, but the parallels are unsettling enough that researchers are calling for investigation into how harmful &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/toxic-algae-blooms-clilmate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;algal bloom&lt;/a&gt; toxins might be impacting human brain health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dolphins are particularly valuable for understanding Alzheimer’s risk because they naturally develop the disease’s two main brain changes as they age: &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/amyloid-beta/"&gt;amyloid-beta plaques&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/game-changing-blood-test-alzheimers-tau-tangles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tau tangles&lt;/a&gt;. When researchers examined dolphin brain tissue under a microscope, they found these same abnormalities. Amyloid-beta deposits scattered through the cortex. Neurons filled with abnormal tau protein. TDP-43 inclusions inside cells and around blood vessels. The physical evidence matched what pathologists see in human Alzheimer’s brains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Summer Blooms Bring Thousandfold Toxin Spike&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute, the University of Miami, and Brain Chemistry Labs examined dolphins that stranded along a 155-kilometer stretch of Florida’s east coast. When they measured brain concentrations of 2,4-DAB, the pattern was stark: during summer bloom months (June through November, when water is warmest), toxin levels were roughly three thousand times higher than during winter months when blooms are minimal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This neurotoxin comes from microscopic organisms that create harmful algal blooms, those thick mats of cyanobacteria that have plagued the Indian River Lagoon for 15 years. As &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; heats coastal waters, these blooms start earlier and last longer. Florida has recorded some of its warmest surface temperatures in modern history over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Toxins move up the food chain, concentrating in small fish that larger predators eat. A dolphin consuming many fish per day accumulates substantial amounts over time, and the toxins end up in brain tissue. Similar processes happen when people regularly &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/seafood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;eat seafood&lt;/a&gt; from bloom-affected waters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Genetic Changes Mirror Human Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When scientists analyzed the complete set of active genes in these dolphin brains, they identified 536 genes with significantly different expression levels between bloom and non-bloom seasons. Many were the same genes disrupted in human &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dolphins showed decreased activity in genes that produce glutamate decarboxylase, an enzyme responsible for making GABA (a neurotransmitter that helps calm brain activity). Meanwhile, 2,4-DAB appears to block the enzyme that breaks GABA down, creating a chemical imbalance. In human &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/pee-alzheimers-memory-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s patients&lt;/a&gt;, this same enzyme shows reduced function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found increased activity in genes related to laminin-3, a protein that helps maintain the blood-brain barrier. Elevated levels could signal that this protective shield (which keeps toxins out of neural tissue) is compromised. In human Alzheimer’s patients, the same protein shows up in disease-related plaques.&lt;/p&gt;

(Credit: David Davis)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Three genes particularly stood out. APP produces amyloid precursor protein, which breaks down into toxic peptides that form plaques. MAPT makes tau protein, which tangles in the neurons of dementia patients. TARDBP creates TDP-43, a protein that clumps abnormally in more than half of Alzheimer’s cases with rapid progression. All three showed increased expression in dolphins exposed to higher toxin levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most concerning was the temporal pattern. Researchers identified 15 genes whose expression correlated with both the amount of toxin in the brain and the year the dolphin stranded. Effects appeared to intensify with each subsequent &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/toxin-in-the-air-algae-blooms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bloom season&lt;/a&gt;, as if brains were accumulating damage over time. Among these genes were AGER (which encodes a receptor involved in Alzheimer’s disease) and ARHGEF19 (linked to neurological disorders).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dolphins also showed increased expression of the APOE gene, up to 6.5-fold in some animals. In humans, certain versions of APOE are the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why This Neurotoxin Matters&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Originally described decades ago, 2,4-DAB provokes tremors, convulsions, and hyperirritability within hours in animal studies. It’s a structural cousin of BMAA (beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine), another algal toxin detected in the brains of human Alzheimer’s patients. Scientists believe 2,4-DAB may be even more toxic than BMAA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers compared dolphin gene expression data with databases of genes affected by &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/vitamin-sea-scientists-create-way-to-supercharge-shellfish-with-nutrients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shellfish&lt;/a&gt; poisoning (caused by other algal toxins), they found that 98% of the dolphin genes overlapped with Alzheimer’s disease, while only 42% overlapped with both conditions. None overlapped exclusively with shellfish poisoning, which means the changes observed were more closely related to neurodegeneration than to acute toxic illness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Harmful algal blooms are not unique to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/florida/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;. As the planet warms, they’re increasing worldwide in both frequency and intensity. Coastal communities from &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/california/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/forever-chemicals-great-lakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Great Lakes&lt;/a&gt; to the Gulf Coast are dealing with blooms that once were rare or nonexistent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People who live near affected waters, who fish recreationally or commercially, or who eat seafood from bloom-affected areas could face exposures similar to what dolphins experience. Toxins accumulate in fish tissue. They can become aerosolized in sea spray. They persist in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Questions naturally follow. Could repeated exposure to algal neurotoxins over years or decades increase Alzheimer’s risk in people? Are certain populations at higher risk based on where they live and what they eat? Should public health officials be monitoring neurotoxin levels in seafood more closely?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Miami-Dade County’s high Alzheimer’s prevalence could reflect many factors: an aging population, genetic backgrounds, healthcare access, environmental exposures. But the county sits on the coast, near waters experiencing repeated harmful algal blooms and hosting dolphins with toxin-damaged brains showing &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s signatures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sentinel species exist for a reason. Canaries in coal mines died from carbon monoxide before miners felt the effects, providing a warning. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/dolphins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dolphins&lt;/a&gt; accumulating brain toxins and developing Alzheimer’s signatures in waters near major population centers may be offering a similar alert. As bloom seasons lengthen and intensify with climate change, these marine mammals are delivering a message from the warming water that coastal communities and public health officials need to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined 20 common bottlenose dolphins that stranded along Florida’s Indian River Lagoon between 2010 and 2019, classifying them by stranding date into non-bloom season (December–May, 11 dolphins) and bloom season (June–November, 9 dolphins). From each dolphin, they extracted brain tissue and tested it for neurotoxins using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, performed whole transcriptome sequencing to analyze gene expression differences, used quantitative PCR to measure seven Alzheimer’s-related genes, and prepared tissue slides to visualize Alzheimer’s-like protein changes under a microscope.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every dolphin tested positive for 2,4-DAB, with bloom-season dolphins showing median brain concentrations approximately 2,900 times higher than non-bloom dolphins. Transcriptome analysis identified 536 differentially expressed genes, with decreased glutamate decarboxylase activity (GABA production) and increased laminin-3 complex expression (blood-brain barrier components). Three key Alzheimer’s genes—APP, MAPT, and TARDBP—showed increased expression correlating with toxin levels, and microscopic examination revealed Alzheimer’s-like changes in all dolphins including amyloid-beta deposits, phosphorylated tau, and TDP-43 inclusions. Fifteen genes showed expression patterns correlating with both toxin concentration and stranding year, intensifying with each bloom season, while APOE gene expression increased up to 6.5-fold in some bloom-season dolphins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The small sample size of 20 dolphins collected opportunistically over nine years limited statistical power, and researchers could not control for all variables affecting brain health or assess neurological function in living animals. The study could not establish direct cause-and-effect relationships between toxin exposure and brain changes, only correlations, and not all samples included tissue from both brain regions. While dolphins serve as sentinel species for environmental health, differences between dolphin and human biology mean findings cannot be directly extrapolated to human health risks without additional research.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;New mothers who give birth via c-section are more likely to suffer severe pain and develop sleep disorders than those who have a vaginal birth &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that new mothers can also try implementing exercise, sleeping when their baby sleeps, avoiding caffeine and alcohol late in the day and practicing deep breathing exercises to help boost sleep at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around one third of births in the US are C-sections, whilst around one in four women in the UK has a caesarean birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But rates of the procedure are rising globally, with figures particularly stark in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2025, 42 per cent of women gave birth via C-section—with experts putting the upward trend down to obesity rates, more women having their babies later than previous generations, and obstetric norms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But experts are concerned that women are not being made aware of the risks that come with the procedure—which women can chose to have for non-medical reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Takenoshita cautioned: 'Those who are planning a C-section should understand that the procedure is linked to more severe pain after delivery and a higher risk of sleep disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Anyone having sleep problems during pregnancy or after childbirth should discuss their concerns with their physician, who can evaluate the issue, make recommendations and refer them to a specialist if necessary,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poor sleep has long been linked to a number of health problems, including cancer stroke and infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Poor sleep has long been linked to a number of health problems, including cancer stroke and infertility, with new mothers typically getting less sleep regardless of delivery method &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nearly a quarter of women require emergency Caesareans, according to NHS Digital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even sleep deprivation in the short-term has been shown to take its toll—from irritability and reduced focus, to increased risk of obesity, heart disease and diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A C-section is considered a major operation, which involves making a cut across a woman's stomach and womb, that carries a number of risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As such, the procedure is usually only carried out if it's considered the safest option for both the mother and child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It may be recommended as a planned procedure—where the risks have been identified and considered before 39 weeks—or carried out in an emergency if vaginal birth is deemed too risky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors may recommend this if the baby is in the breech position, the mother has a low-lying placenta or pregnancy-related high blood pressure, or the baby is not getting enough oxygen and nutrients meaning they need to be delivered immediately.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, women can also opt for a c-section for non medical reasons. If after discussing all the risks with a medical professional, if a woman feels that vaginal birth is still not a viable option for them, they should be offered a planned caesarean, the NHS website states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recovery also usually takes longer than recovering from a vaginal delivery and possible complications can arise including infection, blood clots, excessive bleeding, damage to surrounding tissue and organs, and temporary breathing difficulties for the baby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/viruses-parasites-bacterial-infections/measles-rubeola/2025" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; Friday, the health department warned the public that measles is "highly contagious," adding the virus can "linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves." The department also reiterated the measles vaccine — normally given as part of the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-measles-mmr-vaccine-symptoms/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;combination measles-mumps-rubella or MMR vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — is the "best way to protect yourself and others against measles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-measles-mmr-vaccine-symptoms/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Measles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; can cause &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/measles/symptoms/complications.html#" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;severe infections&lt;/a&gt; in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-texas-preventable-symptoms/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-measles-outbreak-what-to-know/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;highly safe and effective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak in South Carolina is part of a larger trend seen across the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minnesota-measles-cases-jump-to-20/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;health officials in Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reported two new measles cases this week, bringing the state's total number this year to 20. The Minnesota Department of Health said each of the new cases involves unvaccinated children who likely caught measles from an unvaccinated adult. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/measles-case-reported-minneapolis-school/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Eighteen out of the 20 measles cases are children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the health department added. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And earlier this year, the United States recorded the most &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-us-cases-record-high-since-1992/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;measles cases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in more than 30 years, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showed. A &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;large share of the infections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were connected to an outbreak in West Texas that led to &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-death-texas-outbreak/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;the deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/texas-measles-outbreak-second-child-death-unvaccinated/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;two children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreaks-schools-vaccination-rates-decline/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;down from 95.2%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; during the 2019-2020 school year — a critical threshold to keep people safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity)," &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the CDC states&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the latest South Carolina briefing, the upstate region has only about 90% immunity, leaving the community vulnerable to the virus spreading. &lt;/p&gt;

Depending on the cancer type, up to 88% of vaccinated mice stayed tumor-free (depending on the cancer), and the vaccine also reduced -- and in some cases completely prevented -- the spread of cancer throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By engineering these nanoparticles to activate the immune system via multi-pathway activation that combines with cancer-specific antigens, we can prevent tumor growth with remarkable survival rates," says Prabhani Atukorale, assistant professor of biomedical engineering in the Riccio College of Engineering at UMass Amherst and corresponding author on the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atukorale had previously shown that her nanoparticle-based drug design could shrink or eliminate tumors in mice. The new findings reveal that this approach can also prevent cancer from forming in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first experiment, her team combined the nanoparticle system with well-studied melanoma peptides (called an antigen, similar to how a flu shot typically contains parts of the inactivated flu virus). This formulation activated immune cells known as T cells, training them to detect and destroy melanoma cells. Three weeks later, the vaccinated mice were exposed to melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty percent of the mice that received the "super adjuvant" nanoparticle vaccine remained tumor-free and survived the entire study period (250 days). In contrast, all of the mice that received traditional vaccines, non-nanoparticle formulations, or no vaccine at all developed tumors and died within 35 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccine also stopped cancer from spreading to the lungs. When the mice were systemically exposed to melanoma cells to mimic metastasis, none of the nanoparticle-vaccinated mice developed lung tumors, while every other mouse did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Metastases across the board is the highest hurdle for cancer," says Atukorale. "The vast majority of tumor mortality is still due to metastases, and it almost trumps us working in difficult-to-reach cancers, such as melanoma and pancreatic cancer."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atukorale refers to this protection as "memory immunity." "That is a real advantage of immunotherapy, because memory is not only sustained locally," she explains. "We have memory systemically, which is very important. The immune system spans the entire geography of the body."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first phase of testing used a vaccine with known antigens designed for melanoma. However, creating antigens for each cancer type can require extensive genome sequencing or bioinformatics analysis. To simplify the process, the researchers tested a second version using killed tumor cells, called tumor lysate, derived directly from the cancer itself. Mice vaccinated with this nanoparticle lysate vaccine were later exposed to melanoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, or triple-negative breast cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were impressive: 88% of mice with pancreatic cancer, 75% with breast cancer, and 69% with melanoma rejected tumor formation. Furthermore, all mice that remained tumor-free after vaccination also resisted metastasis when exposed systemically to cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The tumor-specific T-cell responses that we are able to generate -- that is really the key behind the survival benefit," says Griffin Kane, postdoctoral research associate at UMass Amherst and first author on the paper. "There is really intense immune activation when you treat innate immune cells with this formulation, which triggers these cells to present antigens and prime tumor-killing T cells."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This robust T-cell response is possible because of the particular nanoparticle design of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccines -- regardless the target disease -- contain two primary components: The antigen and the adjuvant. The antigen is the piece of the disease-causing pathogen (in this study, cancer cells) that the immune system can be trained to target. The adjuvant is a substance that activates the immune system to recognize the antigen, treat it as a foreign intruder and eliminate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atukorale Lab draws inspiration from how pathogens naturally stimulate the immune system. To mount a strong immune response, the body requires multiple "danger" signals triggered through different pathways. "In recent years, we have come to understand how important the selection of the adjuvant is because it drives the second signal that is needed for the correct priming of T and B cells," says Atukorale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, just like oil and water, many of the most promising adjuvants for cancer immunotherapy do not mix well at the molecular level. To overcome this, the Atukorale Lab has engineered a lipid nanoparticle-based "super adjuvant" capable of stably encapsulating and co-delivering two distinct immune adjuvants that activate immunity in a coordinated, synergistic way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that their design offers a platform approach that could be used across multiple cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers envision that this platform can be applied to create both therapeutic and preventative regimens, particularly for individuals at high risk for cancer. This is an idea that Atukorale and Kane have turned into a startup called NanoVax Therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The real core technology that our company has been founded on is this nanoparticle and this treatment approach," says Kane. "This is a platform that Prabhani developed. The startup lets us pursue these translational efforts with the ultimate goal of improving patients' lives."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Atukorale and Kane plan to extend this technology to a therapeutic vaccine and have already taken the initial de-risking steps in translation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atukorale and Kane credit the Biomedical Engineering department and the Institute for Applied Life Sciences at UMass Amherst, UMass Chan Medical School, and funding from the National Institutes of Health for their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the October 9 edition of &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But now, scientists say there's another type of diabetes with a very different cause from the other kinds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(25)00263-3/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(25)00263-3/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;formally classified as "type 5 diabetes"&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; during an international meeting of experts in India earlier this year. (They chose the label "type 5" because other researchers have already proposed "type 3" and "type 4" for other forms of diabetes.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Type 5 diabetes is characterized by insufficient insulin secretion leading to elevated blood glucose levels, similar to other forms of diabetes," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uofmhealth.org/profile/1689085839/rachel-leigh-reinert" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.uofmhealth.org/profile/1689085839/rachel-leigh-reinert" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Rachel Reinert&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an endocrinologist and assistant professor at the University of Michigan, told Live Science in an email. "However, type 5 diabetes is not associated with autoimmunity (as in type 1 diabetes) nor insulin resistance (as is common in type 2 diabetes)." It also lacks the features of the more rare type 3 and type 4 diabetes, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Individuals with type 5 diabetes typically have low body weight and a history of undernutrition starting in early life," Reinert said. Doctors think that chronic undernutrition damages the pancreas early in life, leaving its insulin-producing cells permanently weakened. So the pancreas cannot make enough insulin, but if a patient is given insulin as treatment, their cells are able to respond to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZqrtXyRHbye7Ek9aFntv7e" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZqrtXyRHbye7Ek9aFntv7e slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment for type 5 diabetes needs to be managed carefully as too much insulin, coupled with too little food — a common reality in low-income countries — could result in dangerously low blood sugar. "It is important for all patients with diabetes to know which specific type of diabetes they have, so they can get the right treatment," Reinert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-84e61171-1d92-4ad0-8852-4a4f5f11dbc7" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-yoda-study-3"&gt;The YODA study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="0aa7b53d-1f5a-4a66-bbf9-90f889254d87"&gt;Earlier this year, the Young-Onset Diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa (YODA) study, published in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(25)00120-2/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(25)00120-2/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Lancet Diabetes &amp;amp; Endocrinology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, renewed interest in the condition. The team initially set out to investigate type 1 diabetes among nearly 900 young adults across Cameroon, Uganda and South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the researchers analyzed blood samples, they found that roughly two-thirds of participants lacked the autoimmune markers seen in type 1 diabetes. Further testing revealed that these individuals still produced small but measurable amounts of insulin, unlike classic type 1 cases. But their insulin levels were below the range typically seen in type 2 diabetes. These findings pointed to a distinct, non-autoimmune, insulin-deficient type of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was not the first time in history that the condition had been observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 1950s, British physician Philip Hugh-Jones encountered a group of 13 patients at his diabetes clinic near Kingston, Jamaica, whose symptoms did not fit type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Hugh-Jones called their condition "type J," for Jamaica, but the label was forgotten and the condition was overlooked for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-24336483-2111-4d30-902d-65c6d72b2bfe" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-s-in-a-name-3"&gt;What's in a name?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="f7759bfc-0e72-449f-bd7b-e36a6a0ae67a"&gt;Correctly naming a disease not only helps guide clinicians to the best treatment options, it can also help researchers to track its prevalence and identify which factors affect patients' outcomes, Reinert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="bf7b7bed-9a45-456b-a33c-3d7afce238ae"&gt;Although type 5 diabetes has likely existed for decades, a lack of research has kept it poorly understood.

    &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;On Nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One recurring (and vexing) problem with nutrition research is how inaccurately many studies are communicated. This is most likely to happen on social media and dubious online “media outlets,” but it can happen in reputable media outlets, too. The origins of the miscommunication often come from:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study abstracts (aka summaries) that overinflate the findings of the actual study&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;News releases from university press offices that overinflate or unreasonably extrapolate the findings to populations (based on gender, age, race or species) that weren’t actually studied&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Writers and social media posters who don’t know how to read and write about research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When all three are at play, it can end up a bit like a game of telephone, where what is said about a research study gets further from the truth with each step. One recent cringeworthy example generated headlines such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The hidden neurological war inside every fast-food meal.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;“Bingeing on junk food for just 4 days can damage your brain’s memory hub.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;“Your junk food craving might be harming your memory.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;“Junk food can scramble your brain in just four days.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;“Junk food might be quietly wrecking your memory.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That last headline came from the online version of a popular lifestyle magazine. A few key details in the article are, “junk food can cause the neurons in your brain to become overactive, leading to impaired memory in just four days,” “a special group of brain cells in the hippocampus often become overly active when introduced to a high-fat diet.” And “a high-fat diet typically includes foods like cheeseburgers and fries, or those that are ultraprocessed and typically drenched in saturated fat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on that brief excerpt, ask yourself: What kind of study was this (human or animal)? What were the subjects eating? What were the researchers measuring?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you answered “humans,” “junk food” and something like “a before-and-after test that assessed how ‘scrambled’ their memories were,” those are quite reasonable answers. But there’s one huge problem — the researchers didn’t study humans, or junk food, or scrambled memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was on mice. Not only are humans not mice, but four days is more significant in the short life of a mouse than it is in a long human life. Rather than the cheeseburgers and fries or the doughnuts and chips and pizza shown in the photos that accompany these articles, the mice got a diet of high-fat mouse pellet food. Finally, this study looked at mouse neurons — not human brain function. And while the neurons in the memory center of the brain did become overactive, there was no mention of “scrambled” brains or memories anywhere in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The articles written about this study look like examples of “creative” journalism, but the problem began with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250927031249.htm" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;the news release&lt;/a&gt; about the study, which led with the headline, “Junk food can scramble memory in just four days,” then doubled down by boldly making the unreasonable extrapolation from mouse to human and high-fat mouse chow to burgers and fries. While most of the reporting I saw on this study was just a minor rewrite of the news release, the excerpt I shared was from the worst of the articles — it failed to even mention that the study was done on mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was nothing at all wrong with &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(25)00622-1?" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;the actual study&lt;/a&gt; (from what I could tell). What was wrong was the spin, and as someone who supports nutrition science, that makes me sad, especially when that spin contributes to the Wild West of nutrition misinformation out there.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Then again, people are weird about money. Clearly, paying you fills some psychological need for her. You’ve already made your feelings clear and tried talking her out of it, so there’s no point going down that route again. Instead, why don’t you save up the money she gives you, and every few months donate it to a children’s charity? That seems like a win-win for everyone, especially the charity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It’s up to you whether to make the donation in her name or yours. If you do it in her name, she might appreciate your thoughtful attempt to honor your feelings and hers (and the tax deduction as well) or she might see it as a passive-aggressive maneuver. You know her and I don’t, so that’s your call to make.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;I work as a pediatric nurse with very sick children. When I tell people my occupation, they usually respond with “I don’t know how you deal with sick kids all day” or “How do you not go home and cry after work?” This makes me feel guilty that I can make it through a day without crying. I would hate sitting behind a desk all day. How do I get across to them without seeming insensitive that I love my job and that, although it can be depressing, I can’t imagine doing anything else? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;K.C.&lt;/b&gt; / Boston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;You think &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;feel guilty? Your job probably makes others feel guilty that they’re not contributing to the good of humanity in as direct a way as you are.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I’m a pediatric nurse in a critical-care unit. What do you do?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I’m, uh, the assistant regional manager of a paper-supply company.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Yeah, that guy’s feeling good about himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Joking aside, I don’t think people are saying these things to make you question yourself or out of insecurity and meanness. Rather, they truly don’t get it. It is very hard for folks outside the professions to understand the particular mix of empathy and detachment that enables people to do extraordinarily difficult jobs such as nursing or social work. Not everyone’s mind or heart is set up that way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Instead of trying to explain yourself, tell some stories about the kids you’ve worked with. People understand stories better than theories. Craft one or two anecdotes about people and situations you’ve encountered in your work, and when someone asks, “How can you do that?” say, “I’ve never been an office-y kind of person, and I get so much from it. There was this one time when . . .” Then the other person will have something to grab on to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;My mother is a volunteer with hospice, and I don’t understand, myself, how being with people who are going to die can fail to be depressing and awkward. I don’t understand how her mind works that she can do that. But she’ll tell me stories — sometimes surprisingly funny ones—about her clients, and I get it in a way that I don’t have to “understand.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of mystery surrounding &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/sex" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955843"&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt; in your 60s, 70s and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look online and you’ll find countless threads where curious younger people ask if &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-you-stop-having-sex-when-you-get-old" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955843" data-affiliate="true"&gt;older people are having sex at all,&lt;/a&gt; and if they are having it, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hzvnyg/what_is_sex_like_when_you_are_old_80/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955843"&gt;what it’s like&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskOldPeople/comments/ml9zzw/do_old_people_still_have_sex/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955843"&gt;“What does it feel like?”&lt;/a&gt; others wonder. (Good, we imagine? It’s still sex!) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mystery surrounding sex in older age stems from a combination of factors, according to &lt;a href="https://drshannonchavez.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955843" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Shannon Chavez&lt;/a&gt;, a licensed psychologist and sex therapist in  Beverly Hills, California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, societal taboos and ageist attitudes have led to a marginalization of older adults’ sexuality. No one wants to imagine people their grandparents’ or parents’ age having sex, so we cast out those thoughts. What we get as a result are limited discussions and representations of sex in later life; think of how few scenes we see of older people getting it on in movies and TV, and how often post-50 sex and Viagra are the butt of the joke for late-night comedians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re all going to get older eventually (hopefully, anyway) but because we’ve stigmatized post-50 sex so much, we’re ill-prepared for the realities of it, Chavez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lack of comprehensive sex education tailored to older age groups, leaving many individuals uninformed about the changes and challenges they may face regarding sexuality as they age,” she told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This all leads to misconceptions and curiosity about what sexual experiences are like in later life,” she said. “Overall, increased awareness, education, and open dialogue about sex and aging can help eliminate the mystery and promote healthier attitudes toward sexuality in older age groups.”&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that even a moderate dose of THC reduced internal connectivity in brain circuits responsible for emotional regulation, bodily awareness, sensory processing, and higher thinking. The findings help explain the mental and behavioral changes that many people experience when intoxicated with cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As cannabis use continues to rise among young adults, scientists are increasingly focused on how the drug affects the brain. In particular, THC, the main compound responsible for the “high,” is drawing attention because of its potential to interfere with how different parts of the brain work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research has shown that THC interacts with the brain’s natural cannabinoid system, a network that helps regulate mood, reward, attention, and sensory experiences. THC increases dopamine activity in this system, which can affect behavior and cognition. However, many earlier studies have only looked at specific brain circuits or have used small samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind this new study wanted to take a broader approach, examining THC’s effects across the entire brain. They used a type of brain imaging that measures how brain regions naturally coordinate with each other when a person is at rest, rather than performing a specific task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people use cannabis and we know little about how different cannabinoids like delta-9-THC impact the brain,” said study author Natania A. Crane, an assistant professor and director of the REWARD Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “Delta-9-THC is only one of the over 100 different cannabinoids that make up cannabis. Delta-9-THC is important because it is the main psychoactive compound of cannabis, linked to the addictive and rewarding properties of cannabis. We wanted to understand how delta-9-THC impacts communication between different areas of the brain compared to placebo.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 33 young adults between 18 and 25 years old who occasionally used cannabis but were otherwise healthy. To isolate the effects of THC, each participant took part in two sessions. In one session, they received a 7.5 milligram dose of oral THC. In the other, they received a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sessions were separated by several days, and participants did not know which substance they were receiving. About two hours after taking the pill — when THC’s effects are typically strongest — participants underwent a type of brain scan called resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the scan, participants stared at a fixed point while letting their thoughts wander. The researchers analyzed the brain data using a method that identifies patterns of activity across the whole brain. They examined both how well different parts of each network were working together (called “within-network connectivity”) and how well different networks were interacting with each other (“between-network connectivity”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After taking THC, participants reported stronger feelings of intoxication, as expected. But the brain data revealed more than just a general effect. THC reduced internal communication in several key networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most affected networks involved areas of the brain tied to memory, emotion, and motivation. These included regions like the hippocampus and basal ganglia. Other impacted networks were connected to sensory processing and spatial reasoning. For example, a network linking the parahippocampus and visual cortex showed weakened coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that THC disrupted communication between two networks that include the insula and anterior cingulate cortex — regions often associated with bodily awareness and emotional monitoring. Specifically, THC reduced the connection between the upper and lower parts of these networks, suggesting that these brain systems were not working together as smoothly when the participants were intoxicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the study did not find a link between the strength of these brain changes and how high the participants felt or how often they used cannabis in the past month. This suggests that the observed changes in brain communication happen regardless of how intense the intoxication feels or how frequently someone uses the drug, at least among people who use it occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at how brain activity varied across different frequency bands — essentially, the rhythm of brain signals. They found that THC changed the amount of activity in both low and high frequency bands in certain networks, including those involved in self-awareness and emotional regulation. These changes may reflect shifts in how information is processed throughout the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the findings suggest that THC has widespread effects on how brain systems function together, especially in areas related to thinking, feeling, and sensing. These disruptions could help explain why cannabis use is linked with changes in attention, working memory, and emotional experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Among healthy young adults who occasionally use cannabis, delta-9-THC reduces connections throughout the brain compared to placebo. Specifically, we found that delta-9-THC acutely reduces connections between brain areas involved in emotion, interoception (internal sense of what is happening in your body), processing sensory information, and executive functioning,” Crane told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This may help to explain why individuals who use cannabis often report that cannabis acutely decreases strong emotions, changes how they feel, and increases the intensity of perceptual experiences. It also helps to explain how cannabis acutely decreases attention, working memory, and other executive functioning measures- these networks aren’t communicating the way they usually do when someone is intoxicated with delta-9-THC.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study provides a broader look at how THC affects the brain, but some limitations should be considered. The sample size was relatively small and included only occasional cannabis users without major psychiatric conditions. As a result, the findings might not apply to people who use cannabis more heavily or who have mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a moderate dose of THC, which may be lower than the amount found in some recreational products. Because the drug was given in a controlled lab setting, the results might differ from what happens when cannabis is smoked or consumed in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the study relied on short brain scans taken during a single session. Longer or repeated scans could provide a more complete picture of how THC changes brain function over time. The researchers also note that their method, while sensitive, may not capture all aspects of how the brain responds to THC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies may want to examine different doses of THC, include people with anxiety or depression, or compare THC with other compounds in cannabis, such as cannabidiol (CBD). The researchers are also interested in tracking how repeated cannabis use over time affects brain networks, especially in people who use the drug to manage mood symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am really interested in understanding how different cannabinoids impact the brain among individuals with psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety, who have high rates of cannabis use. So many patients I see report that they use cannabis to help with depression and/or anxiety. The research tells us that cannabis can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety acutely, yet over time regular cannabis use, especially cannabis with high delta-9-THC content, actually increases symptoms of depression and anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This leads to a vicious cycle — using cannabis to relieve anxiety or depression, but these symptoms just get worse as use continues. I want to better understand the mechanisms of this—how cannabinoids like delta-9-THC act in the brain acutely and over time among individuals with psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2025.09.005" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol Alters Limbic and Frontal Functional Brain Connectomes Among Young Adult Cannabis Users&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Zachary Anderson, Matthew Gunn, Emily Jones, Olusola Ajilore, K.Luan Phan, Harriet de Wit, Heide Klumpp, Vince Calhoun, and Natania A.

&lt;p&gt;But can someone really be addicted to food in the same way they could be hooked on substances such as alcohol or nicotine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6LdTa5QAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;oi=ao"&gt;addiction psychiatrist and researcher&lt;/a&gt; with experience in treating eating disorders and obesity, I have been following the research in this field for the past few decades. I have written a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-83078-6"&gt;textbook on food addiction, obesity and overeating disorders&lt;/a&gt;, and, more recently, a self-help book for &lt;a href="https://www.newharbinger.com/9781648484681/rewire-your-food-addicted-brain/?srsltid=AfmBOooBA1XtZ9Uea0tv2baj9t8v7TXnaPW7WBf21RqvKUM-imc32kzO"&gt;people who have intense cravings and obsessions for some foods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is still some debate among psychologists and scientists, a consensus is emerging that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2007.04.019"&gt;food addiction is a real phenomenon&lt;/a&gt;. Hundreds of studies have confirmed that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.70338"&gt;certain foods – often those that are high in sugar and ultraprocessed&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7570/jomes25053"&gt;affect the brains and behavior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83116-0"&gt;of certain people&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2019.112574"&gt;similarly to other addictive substances&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16065"&gt;nicotine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, many questions remain about which foods are addictive, which people are most susceptible to this addiction and why. There are also questions as to how this condition compares to other substance addictions and whether the same treatments could work for patients struggling with any kind of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does addiction work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK597351/"&gt;neurobiological mechanisms of addiction&lt;/a&gt; have been mapped out through decades of laboratory-based research using neuroimaging and cognitive neuroscience approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies show that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2018.09.010"&gt;preexisting genetic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/adb0000870"&gt;environmental factors&lt;/a&gt; set the stage for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-023-00034-y"&gt;developing an addiction&lt;/a&gt;. Regularly consuming an addictive substance then causes a rewiring of several &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.10.024"&gt;important brain systems&lt;/a&gt;, leading the person to crave more and more of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This rewiring takes place in &lt;a href="https://www.newharbinger.com/9781648484681/rewire-your-food-addicted-brain/?srsltid=AfmBOopjx6BZgKuKhvAdGDFBjZPHVbZiJSDRThQXyEsSsw4nYc1i8iV7"&gt;three key brain networks&lt;/a&gt; that correspond to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2015.10.024"&gt;key functional domains&lt;/a&gt;, often referred to as the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.06.011"&gt;reward system&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2009.03.038"&gt;the stress response system&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/revneuro-2013-0054"&gt;the system in charge of executive control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, using an addictive substance causes the release of a chemical messenger &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22581-dopamine"&gt;called dopamine&lt;/a&gt; in the reward network, which makes the user feel good. Dopamine release also facilitates a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-018-0191-4"&gt;neurobiological process called conditioning&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically a neural learning process that gives rise to habit formation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the conditioning process, sensory cues associated with the substance start to have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00264"&gt;increasing influence over decision-making and behavior&lt;/a&gt;, often leading to a craving. For instance, because of conditioning, the sight of a needle can drive a person to set aside their commitment to quit using an injectable drug and return to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, continued use of an addictive substance over time affects the brain’s emotional or stress response network. The user’s body and mind build up a tolerance, meaning they need increasing amounts of the substance to feel its effect. The neurochemicals involved in this process are different than those mediating habit formation and include a chemical messenger called noradrenaline and internally produced opioids such as endorphins. If they quit using the substance, they experience &lt;a href="https://americanaddictioncenters.org/withdrawal-timelines-treatments"&gt;symptoms of withdrawal&lt;/a&gt;, which can range from irritability and nausea to paranoia and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/7854_2021_288"&gt;negative reinforcement kicks in&lt;/a&gt;. This is the process by which a person keeps going back to a substance because they’ve learned that using the substance doesn’t just feel good, but it also relieves negative emotions. During withdrawal from a substance, people feel profound emotional discomfort, including sadness and irritability. Negative reinforcement is why someone who is trying to quit smoking, for instance, will be at highest risk of relapse in the week just after stopping and during times of stress, because in the past they’d normally turn to cigarettes for relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, overuse of most addictive substances progressively damages the brain’s executive control network, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/prefrontal-cortex"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;, and other key parts of the brain &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1010654108"&gt;involved in impulse control and self-regulation&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, the damage to these areas makes it more and more difficult for the user to control their behavior around these substances. This is why it is so hard for long-term users of many addictive substances to quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p class="youtube-classic-embed"&gt;&lt;span class="w-full flex justify-center !m-0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Scientists have learned more about what’s happening in a person’s brain when they become addicted to a substance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What evidence is there that food is addictive?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many studies over the past 25 years have shown that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22639"&gt;high-sugar and other highly pleasurable foods&lt;/a&gt; – often foods &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980018003762"&gt;that are ultraprocessed&lt;/a&gt; – act on these brain networks in ways that are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/foods-high-in-added-fats-and-refined-carbs-are-like-cigarettes-addictive-and-unhealthy-165441"&gt;similar to other addictive substances&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting changes in the brain &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.05.008"&gt;fuel further craving for and overuse of the substance&lt;/a&gt; – in this case, highly rewarding food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical studies have demonstrated that people with an addictive relationship to food demonstrate the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/add.16065"&gt;hallmark signs of a substance use disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies also indicate that for some people, cravings for highly palatable foods go well beyond just a normal hankering for a snack and are, in fact, signs of addictive behavior. One study found that cues associated with highly pleasurable foods activate the reward centers in the brain, and the degree of activation &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.10.071"&gt;predicts weight gain&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, the more power the food cue has to capture a person’s attention, the more likely they are to succumb to cravings for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple studies have also found that suddenly ending a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.13507"&gt;diet that’s high in sugar can cause withdrawal&lt;/a&gt;, similar to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2007.04.019"&gt;when people quit opioids&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2018.09.013"&gt;nicotine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excessive exposure to high-sugar foods has also been found to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/lm.038000.114"&gt;reduce cognitive function and cause damage&lt;/a&gt; to the prefrontal cortex and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/hippocampus"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;, the parts of the brain that mediate executive control and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another study, when obese people were exposed to food and told to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41366-019-0484-z"&gt;resist their craving for it&lt;/a&gt; by ignoring it or thinking about something else, their prefrontal cortexes were more active compared with nonobese individuals. This indicates that it was more difficult for the obese group to fight their cravings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/thoughts-about-food-cause-fear-and-panic-in-royalty-free-illustration/2173543908?phrase=food%20addiction&amp;amp;searchscope=image,film&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;Viktar Sarkisian/iStock via Getty Images Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding safe treatments for patients struggling with food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addiction recovery is often centered on the idea that the fastest way to get well is to abstain from the problem substance. But unlike nicotine or narcotics, food is something that all people need to survive, so quitting cold turkey isn’t an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, eating disorders such as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bulimia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353615"&gt;bulimia nervosa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/binge-eating-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353627"&gt;binge-eating disorder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40429-022-00411-0"&gt;often occur alongside addictive eating&lt;/a&gt;. Most psychologists and psychiatrists believe these illnesses have their root cause in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12102937"&gt;excessive dietary restriction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, many eating disorder treatment professionals balk at the idea of labeling some foods as addictive. They are concerned that encouraging abstinence from particular foods could trigger &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12102937"&gt;binge eating and extreme dieting to compensate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A way forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But others argue that, with care, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu16132019"&gt;integrating food addiction approaches into eating disorders treatment&lt;/a&gt; is feasible and could be lifesaving for some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emerging consensus around this link is moving researchers and those who treat eating disorders to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-024-01017-9"&gt;consider food addiction in their treatment models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such approach might look like &lt;a href="https://www.newharbinger.com/9781648484681/rewire-your-food-addicted-brain/?srsltid=AfmBOooIfW4_BgKGysr2y90Cts7qyqjoKdpF5HIxXAiNMPY7rRHDYKI3"&gt;the one described to me&lt;/a&gt; by addiction psychiatrist and eating disorders specialist Dr. Kim Dennis. In line with traditional eating disorder treatment, nutritionists at her residential clinic strongly discourage their patients from restricting calories. At the same time, in line with traditional addiction treatment, they help their patients to consider significantly reducing or completely abstaining from particular foods to which they have developed an addictive relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1556988"&gt;clinical studies&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2024.107211"&gt;already being carried out&lt;/a&gt;. But going forward, more studies are needed to help clinicians find the most effective treatments for people with an addictive relationship with food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1542905"&gt;are underway&lt;/a&gt; by groups of psychologists, psychiatrists, neuroscientists and mental health providers to get “ultraprocessed food use disorder,” also known as food addiction, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000527322"&gt;into future editions of diagnostic manuals&lt;/a&gt; such as the &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm"&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/classification-of-diseases"&gt;World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond acknowledging what those treating food addiction are already seeing in the field, this would help researchers get funding for additional studies of treating food addiction. With more information about what treatments will work best for whom, those who have these problems will no longer have to suffer in silence, and providers will be better equipped to help them.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Before the pandemic helped fuel the growth of vaccine politicization across the country, less than 1% of Austin school district’s kindergarteners in the fall of 2019 failed to comply with the state’s vaccine reporting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Five years later, Austin ISD had some of the state’s highest number of kindergarteners who neglected those state requirements — about 1 in 5 kindergarteners had not proven they were fully vaccinated against measles and did not file an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;A Texas Tribune analysis has found that this explosion of vaccine non-compliance has played out across many school districts in the state in recent years, helping to push Texas’ measles vaccine coverage to the lowest it’s been since at least 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We definitely were on a better trajectory [before the pandemic],” said Alana Bejarano, executive director of health services and nursing for the Austin school district, which reported a 23% delinquency rate for the measles vaccines among their kindergarteners.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I don't know that I can pinpoint the concrete answer, except [preschool and kindergarteners] were born at a time where everything kind of went off track and getting them back into that, you know, that's been difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Tribune examined kindergarten measles vaccination compliance because it’s the earliest the state documents school vaccination rates and measles can be especially deadly for young children. The state’s two measles deaths this year were girls ages 6 and 8. Under Texas vaccine requirements, most kindergarteners must show they are fully vaccinated against measles or file an exemption to enroll in school; most who are not fully vaccinated have an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;During the pandemic, the statewide measles vaccine delinquency rate — a term the Texas Department of State Health Services uses to track students not compliant with those requirements — more than doubled.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Tribune estimated the number of vaccine-delinquent kindergarteners in each district by comparing delinquency rates and enrollment totals.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In school districts with the most delinquent kindergarteners in the 2024-25 school year, the latest data available from the state, as much as 44% of their kindergarteners were delinquent in the measles vaccines, and their delinquencies also outnumbered exemptions, which was not the case at the state level. Those school districts had vaccine delinquency rates as small as a fraction of a percent just five years prior.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The five other vaccinations required for kindergarten followed similar increases in delinquency rates during the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The pandemic is the driving force behind the increase in vaccine delinquency, school district officials say. Many children are entering school after falling behind on their immunizations during the pandemic, making it an untenable task for resource-strapped school districts to chase after parents to vaccinate their children or submit an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Meanwhile, access to vaccines, especially free and low-cost doses, have also dwindled over the last several years amid funding cuts and the politicization of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;State laws and rules don't dictate who has to enforce vaccine compliance, although the Texas Department of State Health Services administers the law and school districts have traditionally been among the first line of enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;While school districts acknowledge they are enrolling students not compliant with state vaccine requirements, district officials say they are caught in a no-win situation. Pushing vaccines too hard could lead to retaliation from groups and politicians opposed to vaccine mandates, and district officials don’t want to disenroll students — public schools have a responsibility to educate all children and so much of their funding is tied to attendance, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We encourage our school nurses to advocate strongly to promote and protect public health at their campus,” Becca Harkleroad, executive director of the Texas School Nurse Organization. “But ultimately it’s up to the superintendent and the principal to decide how strictly they are going to enforce it or if they are going to enforce it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


  
  

  





    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Statewide, the percentage of kindergarteners who were delinquent in getting the measles vaccine more than doubled to 2.68% between 2019-20 and 2024-25, the latest data available. The delinquency rate jumped to 3.1% in 2021-22, surpassing the number of students who had an exemption. Those rates have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, although the exemption rate has returned to exceeding the delinquency rate.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that a year ago 25,000 Texas kindergarteners were not fully vaccinated against measles. Of those, more than 16,000 had an exemption, and about 9,000 did not have an exemption and under the state’s definition, were vaccine delinquent.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The overall vaccine delinquency rates may be small, but anything that causes vaccination levels to fall means more children are vulnerable. Ideally, schools try to keep their vaccination levels at 95% to help protect those children with compromised immune systems or medical conditions that keep them from being vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In addition to vaccine delinquency, the state also tracks the percentage of students who are vaccinated, formally exempt from vaccinations, and provisionally enrolled because of vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Most unvaccinated students in Texas are permitted to enroll because they have an exemption form or a note from a doctor. They can also provisionally enroll without proving vaccination status if they are homeless, military dependents or in foster care and their records cannot be obtained by the start of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Texas measles kindergarten vaccination rate of 93% is the lowest it's been since at least 2011, ranking the state 18th nationally.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The decrease in vaccination rates overall is certainly a concern because it leaves our population vulnerable to different infections,” said Dr. Erin Nicholson, a pediatric infection physician at Texas Children’s Hospital and an assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine. “And we saw that front and center with the measles outbreak that recently happened.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="9772a9c8-bc90-434e-961a-35f2985af4e1" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Schools: A first line of defense against infectious disease&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;By the time most children enter kindergarten, they have received two MMR vaccination doses, &lt;a href="https://www.bswhealth.com/conditions/measles-rubeola/mmr-vaccine"&gt;which will provide lifelong protection&lt;/a&gt; against measles, as well as mumps and rubella for most people. The MMR vaccination for kindergarteners is considered one of the &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/vaccination/maintain-vaccination-coverage-level-2-doses-mmr-vaccine-children-kindergarten-iid-04"&gt;most important immunization targets by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;State health officials audit school vaccination records each year for accuracy, by sampling school district records, explains Chris Van Deusen, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services. But there is nothing in state rules that requires DSHS to enforce the vaccination requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As a result, the de facto enforcement has traditionally fallen to school districts.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Some of the state’s highest kindergarten measles delinquency rates were in larger school districts and charter networks: KIPP Texas Public Schools (44%), Spring ISD (30%), Austin ISD (23%), Dallas ISD (20%), and Houston ISD (7%).&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The five public school systems with the highest counts made up more than half of all delinquent kindergartners in the state, despite enrolling less than 10% of the state’s public school kindergarteners.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


  
  

  





    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Some district officials, including Dallas, say they try to follow state requirements by sending home students who do not have completed vaccination requirements or an exemption. But, they enroll those students, contributing to the district’s vaccine delinquency rate.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Austin school district will also enroll the students who don’t meet vaccine requirements, but they wait to send those students home until their parents have been notified of their vaccine delinquency three times, Bejarano said. They can return once they have proof of vaccination or the exemption form.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;State data doesn’t track how many vaccine-delinquent students school districts send home. It also doesn't reflect changes to vaccine delinquency later in the year because the data is based on surveys school districts submit in the first half of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;While some school districts say they try to send home students who don’t meet vaccine requirements, Houston ISD officials said they are keeping those students in the classroom. They, too, dedicate time and resources to track all students’ vaccination status and try to communicate information with parents about the need for staying up to date on the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But, they are “not excluding students from learning based on vaccine status,” according to a statement to the Tribune.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Chanthini Thomas, a school nurse who retired from her job at Houston ISD’s Bellaire High School last summer, said the conflicting messages from the district, resource reductions and the yearlong chase to get vaccine paperwork in was frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“You have little support,” she said. “Why would you say…that’s a requirement to any school for the state of Texas but then you put out a mandate from the district to say, don’t let immunizations prevent enrollment? And the reason is because they need the numbers, because the numbers were dwindling.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Like many other urban school districts, HISD is battling &lt;a href="https://perc.tamu.edu/blog/2025/06/texas-enrollment.html?utm"&gt;declining enrollment&lt;/a&gt; — and the funding that comes with it — as more families move toward better job opportunities and lower housing costs in the suburbs or choose charter and private schools.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As school nurses have told the Tribune over the summer, school districts choose to enroll unvaccinated children so they can keep “butts in the seats” and the base amount of money they receive from state and local sources to educate each student — &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/28/texas-school-funding-explainer/#:~:text=When%20Texas%20school%20districts%20talk,meet%20each%20student%27s%20educational%20needs."&gt;about $6,160&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I see the school as being in a tough spot,” said Melissa Gilkey, a University of North Carolina professor who studies vaccine efforts at schools. “We work so hard to minimize absenteeism…that I do have some sympathy for that idea that it's hard to exclude them for one health service.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;KIPP Texas Public Schools, a charter network with campuses across the state, declined an interview but insisted it was following the state immunization requirements. Its kindergarten measles vaccine delinquency rate was less than 1% in 2019 compared to 44% last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Spring ISD, north of Houston, reported last year that more than 30% of its kindergarteners were measles vaccine delinquent. The district informed the Tribune it also follows state rules closely but said its high MMR delinquency rate was evidence of “enrollment and access issues” and that Spring ISD was “actively working to strengthen this process.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Spring district cited family’s frequent moves in the area, limited access to health care and language barriers as reasons there’s a delay in getting student shot records updated in time for school.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We are committed to improving compliance rates and ensuring our students are protected against preventable diseases,” said Shane Strubhart, the Spring ISD spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="b42ef658-3def-4a92-9836-45bc5d4f7878" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Access to vaccines has dwindled&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The pandemic disrupted preventive health care, becoming most apparent in some of the most recent kindergarten classes, filled with students born around the first COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic not only interrupted home and school life, experts say, it upended regular health checkups younger children typically receive before they start school and that impact continues to be felt today.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Families “going to see the doctors got off track for everyone during the pandemic,” Austin ISD’s Bejarano said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;For low-income and immigrant families who already found health care access a challenge, more are struggling to find what Bejarano calls their “medical” home, a regular primary care doctor who can either vaccinate their children or answer concerns and perhaps direct them to the state’s exemption process if they feel strong enough to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“COVID didn't do vaccination or education and many other things as a whole, any favors,” said Jennifer Finley, executive director of health services for Dallas ISD. The district’s kindergarten measles delinquency rate jumped to 20% last school year compared to 1% during the 2019-20 school year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Diminished vaccine access is also a factor. Up until the early aughts, public health departments, churches and even lawmakers would hold free or low-cost immunization clinics over the summer for families.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In 2004, the Dallas school district turned away hundreds of students, who walked and drove to nearby clinics for free or low-cost vaccines, according to a Dallas Morning News article.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;After the pandemic, those resources are even fewer.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It really stopped during the pandemic,” Finley said. “Some of the folks lost their funding.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Schools rely heavily on local public health departments to help them with vaccination clinics. Once the threat of COVID lessened, public health departments used those funds to add more staff and hold more vaccination clinics.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But two things began &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/08/18/texas-school-vaccination-budget-cuts/"&gt;impacting vaccination efforts&lt;/a&gt; by local health departments. First, those leftover funds were clawed back early by the Trump administration this year, prompting some staff to look for other jobs, thereby causing staff shortages in public health vaccination departments. And second, public health officials suspect more immigrant families are shying away from vaccination because of stepped-up immigration efforts and deportations.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Texas, there are an &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/01/18/texas-border-schools-donald-trump-mass-deportations/"&gt;estimated 111,000 undocumented children&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom do not qualify for state Medicaid health insurance coverage, attending school.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We typically have big lines and the waiting room is packed. Our whole lobby is packed,” Dr. Phil Huang, the director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department, told the Tribune in August. “This year it has not been that way.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="5f7520ac-9c03-4c5f-80ee-dfb644eed4b2" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Vaccine hesitancy changing school messaging&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;After the pandemic, many parents watched as debates raged over the safety of the quickly-developed COVID-19 vaccine. As a result, they are asking more questions about all childhood vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In many cases, parents are spreading MMR doses out and that, too, could be the reason for more kindergartners showing up with an incomplete vaccination status, Bejarano said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The main concern [among parents] is basically, ‘Am I doing the right thing for my child, that is in their best interest and help me understand what the risks are of these infectious diseases that vaccines are trying to prevent,’” Nicholson, the Texas Children’s physician, said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Before COVID, many doctors adopted an imperial tone — “you should do this because I’m the expert,” she said. That changed after the pandemic. “We are looking at how we talk to these parents, because the last thing that we want to do is come across as condescending.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;School nurses have also worked tirelessly to try to find a winning formula to reach families of vaccine-delinquent kids. At a national school nurse conference in Austin this summer, an entire session was devoted to teaching nurses how to have tension-free conversations with parents who are skeptical of vaccine requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Ultimately, school nurses just want to inform parents of their two options to stay compliant with state rules: either provide proof of vaccination or an exemption, Bejarano said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We’ve made these large campaigns and we are really kind when they register, letting them know what is the law, what the exemptions [are],” Bejarano said. “I just think the district in general is understanding we need to do better when it comes to public health and getting these rates up.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The good news, she says, is that the greater efforts made by school nurses in the fall to try to help parents become vaccine compliant tends to push down the high delinquency rates by the end of the school year. Data provided to the Tribune by Austin ISD proved that out. That 23% delinquency rate for kindergartners recorded in the fall of 2024 fell drastically to 6% by May 2025 possibly due to the fear produced by the measles outbreak in the months prior.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I do think that everybody came together in the Austin community and really did try to push for that” compliance, Bejarano said. “And I think that’s why it helped the rate last year.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Finley points to other lesser-known reasons complicating the back-to-school vaccination picture. Among them, an influx of students came to Texas from other states, many already armed with vaccination exemptions or with incomplete vaccination histories who are having to be re-educated about Texas requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Starting Sept. 1, Texas parents can more easily obtain a vaccine exemption form by downloading it off the state’s website, but how that will impact the delinquency gap won’t be seen until data is released next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Nicholson, Finley, Bejarano and others say they would like to see more data that clearly explains the rising delinquency rate and how many students who were once marked delinquent end up becoming fully vaccinated or obtaining an exemption by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Does it mean, you know, people are just struggling with paperwork?” Nicholson said. “Or does it mean that really those vaccinations are falling?”&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="113" data-end="465"&gt;When you don’t have a romantic partner to come home to, you start engineering your own safety net. And no, that doesn’t mean “being tougher” or pretending you don’t need anyone. It means building habits that make you emotionally steady, day in and day out—habits that psychology consistently links to resilience, wellbeing, and long-term mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="467" data-end="629"&gt;Below are seven evidence-backed habits I keep seeing in people who stand strong without a life partner. Each habit is practical, humane, and—crucially—repeatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="636" data-end="707"&gt;1) They build a &lt;strong data-start="655" data-end="672"&gt;constellation&lt;/strong&gt; of support (not just one “person”)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="709" data-end="1048"&gt;People who thrive solo don’t try to replace a partner with a single best friend. They diversify. They maintain a few close confidants, keep up with family, and nurture “weak-tie” connections—baristas, gym acquaintances, neighbors. This web of ties spreads emotional load and increases the odds that someone is available when you need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1050" data-end="1418"&gt;It isn’t soft science: large meta-analyses show that strong social relationships predict better health and even lower mortality risk; quantity &lt;strong data-start="1193" data-end="1200"&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; quality matter. And &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2910600/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on “weak ties” finds that even brief, friendly exchanges boost belonging and mood—especially useful when you’re not returning to a partner each night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1420" data-end="1663"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1420" data-end="1433"&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep a “social portfolio.” Each week: one deeper catch-up (walk or call), one casual touchpoint (DM or voice note), one weak-tie micro-interaction (ask the barista’s name, chat your building’s guard). These tiny touches compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1670" data-end="1734"&gt;2) They regulate mood &lt;strong data-start="1695" data-end="1715"&gt;through the body&lt;/strong&gt; (movement + sleep)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1736" data-end="1907"&gt;When you live alone, your nervous system doesn’t automatically co-regulate with a partner’s presence. So the disciplined soloist uses body-based levers to steady emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1909" data-end="1932"&gt;Two high-impact levers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="1934" data-end="2414"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="1934" data-end="2209"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1936" data-end="2209"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1936" data-end="1959"&gt;Steps, not heroics.&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2828073"&gt;2024 systematic review/meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; (33 studies; 96k adults) linked higher daily step counts to fewer depressive symptoms; ≥7,000 steps/day was associated with lower depression risk in prospective analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="2210" data-end="2414"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2212" data-end="2414"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2212" data-end="2228"&gt;Sleep first.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7181893/"&gt;Reviews&lt;/a&gt; connecting sleep and emotion show that poor sleep impairs emotion regulation; better sleep quality supports stability and healthier coping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2416" data-end="2586"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2416" data-end="2429"&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; Put a non-negotiable floor (e.g., 7,000–8,000 steps) and a sleep window (e.g., lights out by 11 p.m., devices parked). Treat these like meds you take daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2593" data-end="2674"&gt;3) They practice &lt;strong data-start="2613" data-end="2645"&gt;self-compassionate self-talk&lt;/strong&gt; (not pep-talks, &lt;em data-start="2662" data-end="2668"&gt;safe&lt;/em&gt; talk)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2676" data-end="3067"&gt;Without a partner saying “hey, you did your best,” emotionally independent people learn to say it to themselves—and it’s more than a feel-good slogan. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22796446/"&gt;Meta-analyses&lt;/a&gt; show self-compassion is robustly associated with less depression/anxiety and greater wellbeing. You’re not lowering standards; you’re lowering &lt;em data-start="2984" data-end="2997"&gt;self-attack&lt;/em&gt;, which frees energy for action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3069" data-end="3097"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3069" data-end="3095"&gt;Try this (30 seconds):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol data-start="3098" data-end="3288"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="3098" data-end="3138"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3101" data-end="3138"&gt;&lt;em data-start="3101" data-end="3109"&gt;Notice&lt;/em&gt; the pain (“This is hard”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="3139" data-end="3181"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3142" data-end="3181"&gt;&lt;em data-start="3142" data-end="3153"&gt;Normalize&lt;/em&gt; it (“Struggle is human”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="3182" data-end="3288"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3185" data-end="3288"&gt;&lt;em data-start="3185" data-end="3194"&gt;Nurture&lt;/em&gt; yourself (“What’s one kind thing I can do next?”).&lt;br data-start="3245" data-end="3248"&gt;Repeat often, especially after mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3295" data-end="3352"&gt;4) They &lt;strong data-start="3306" data-end="3333"&gt;write their way through&lt;/strong&gt; difficult emotions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3354" data-end="3830"&gt;When you don’t have a built-in listener at home, a blank page can be one.&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-psychiatric-treatment/article/emotional-and-physical-health-benefits-of-expressive-writing/ED2976A61F5DE56B46F07A1CE9EA9F9F"&gt; Classic “expressive writing” protocols&lt;/a&gt;—15–20 minutes/day for 3–5 days about a stressful topic—show small but reliable benefits for physical and psychological health across many studies. Later work refines the picture (e.g., some populations benefit more; positive writing can also help), but the core idea holds: making meaning on the page helps metabolize stress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3832" data-end="4011"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3832" data-end="3845"&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; Set a 15-minute timer. Write your “deepest thoughts and feelings” about what’s hard—no grammar, no audience. End with two sentences about “what I control this week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4018" data-end="4091"&gt;5) They use &lt;strong data-start="4033" data-end="4063"&gt;smarter emotion regulation&lt;/strong&gt; (reappraisal &amp;gt; suppression)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4093" data-end="4664"&gt;Alone doesn’t mean armored. People who cope well solo don’t bottle feelings—they &lt;em data-start="4174" data-end="4183"&gt;reframe&lt;/em&gt; them. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12212647/"&gt;Foundational work&lt;/a&gt; on emotion regulation shows &lt;strong data-start="4236" data-end="4261"&gt;cognitive reappraisal&lt;/strong&gt; (changing how you interpret a situation) reliably reduces negative emotion and is generally more adaptive than suppression. Mindfulness programs (e.g., MBSR) also produce small-to-moderate reductions in stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in rigorous reviews. Together, these skills become your internal thermostat when nobody’s at home to help turn the dial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4666" data-end="4902"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4666" data-end="4679"&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; When a thought spikes (“I’m failing at this”), ask: &lt;em data-start="4732" data-end="4764"&gt;What’s another accurate story?&lt;/em&gt; (“I’m early in the curve; effort is data.”) If the mind won’t budge, sit for 60 seconds, eyes soft, counting breaths to 10 and back down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4909" data-end="4985"&gt;6) They &lt;strong data-start="4920" data-end="4949"&gt;ask for help like a skill&lt;/strong&gt; (therapy, groups, guided self-help)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4987" data-end="5470"&gt;Emotionally independent doesn’t mean emotionally isolated. People who last without a partner tend to be &lt;strong data-start="5091" data-end="5104"&gt;proactive&lt;/strong&gt; about professional and peer support: therapy, skills groups, or guided online programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4987" data-end="5470"&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23870719/"&gt;cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)&lt;/a&gt; remains a well-supported treatment for depression; network meta-analyses suggest multiple delivery formats (individual, group, phone, guided self-help) can be effective—use what’s accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5472" data-end="5536"&gt;Two upgrades that help when you don’t have a built-in confidant:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="5538" data-end="5770"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5538" data-end="5652"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5540" data-end="5652"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5540" data-end="5561"&gt;Ask specifically.&lt;/strong&gt; Replace “Can we talk?” with “Do you have 15 minutes tonight to help me think through X?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5653" data-end="5770"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5655" data-end="5770"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5655" data-end="5673"&gt;Set a cadence.&lt;/strong&gt; A monthly “maintenance” session (therapist or support group) prevents problems from stockpiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5777" data-end="5831"&gt;7) They &lt;strong data-start="5788" data-end="5831"&gt;anchor life in purpose and contribution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5833" data-end="6300"&gt;A partner often supplies daily meaning: shared goals, routines, mirrors. Solo, you manufacture meaning—through mastery, service, community. Observational syntheses link &lt;strong data-start="6002" data-end="6018"&gt;volunteering&lt;/strong&gt; with better mental health and even survival (with the usual caveat that causality is complex).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5833" data-end="6300"&gt;More broadly, the &lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-13-773"&gt;friendship literature&lt;/a&gt; shows that investing in supportive friendships—alongside purposeful activities—tracks with higher wellbeing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6302" data-end="6483"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6302" data-end="6315"&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; Pair one &lt;em data-start="6325" data-end="6334"&gt;mastery&lt;/em&gt; block (learning a skill 2–3 hours/week) with one &lt;em data-start="6384" data-end="6393"&gt;service&lt;/em&gt; block (a weekly shift, call tree, or mentoring slot). Purpose sticks when it’s scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8411" data-end="8426"&gt;A final word&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8428" data-end="8787"&gt;If you’ve been navigating life without a partner’s shoulder to lean on, you’ve probably built more strength than you give yourself credit for. The point isn’t to prove you don’t need people—it’s to create a life where support is &lt;strong data-start="8657" data-end="8672"&gt;distributed&lt;/strong&gt;: some from the body, some from the mind, some from friends and community, and some from professionals when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8789" data-end="9106"&gt;Psychology’s message is surprisingly hopeful here: you can &lt;em data-start="8848" data-end="8855"&gt;train&lt;/em&gt; resilience. Steps and sleep steady the system. Self-compassion softens the blow. Journaling creates coherence. Reappraisal and mindfulness give you levers. Help-seeking becomes a skill. Friendship and contribution make life larger than your problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9108" data-end="9342"&gt;Do a little, daily. Let the habits carry the weight that a single person might once have carried. Over time, you’ll feel something sturdy forming under your feet—a kind of quiet confidence that doesn’t depend on who’s waiting at home.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Geneva -- &lt;/em&gt;The World Health Organization sounded the alarm Monday over soaring numbers of drug-resistant bacterial infections, compromising the effectiveness of life-saving treatments and rendering minor injuries and common infections potentially deadly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations' health agency warned that one in six laboratory-confirmed bacterial infections worldwide in 2023 showed resistance to antibiotic treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings are deeply concerning," Yvan J-F. Hutin, head of the WHO's antimicrobial resistance department, told reporters. "As antibiotic resistance continues to rise, we're running out of treatment options and we're putting lives at risk." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria have long developed resistance against medicines designed to fight them, rendering many drugs useless. And that's been accelerated by the massive use of antibiotics to treat humans, animals and food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) superbugs directly cause over a million deaths and contribute to nearly five million every year, according to the WHO. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a report on AMR surveillance, the WHO examined resistance prevalence estimates for 22 antibiotics used to treat infections of the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts, the bloodstream and those used to treat gonorrhoea.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the five years leading to up 2023, antibiotic resistance increased in over 40 percent of the monitored antibiotics, with an average annual rise of between five and 15 percent, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For urinary tract infections, resistance to commonly-used antibiotics was typically higher than 30 percent globally, it showed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report looked at eight common bacteria pathogens, including E. coli and K. pneumoniae, which can lead to severe bloodstream infections that frequently result in sepsis, organ failure and death. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO warned that more than 40 percent of E. coli infections and 55 percent of K. pneumoniae infections globally are now resistant to third-generation cephalosporins -- the first-choice treatment for these infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Antimicrobial resistance is outpacing advances in modern medicine, threatening the health of families worldwide," WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nightmare-bacteria-drug-resistant-cases-increase-cdc-report/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;said last month that&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; infection rates from drug-resistant "nightmare bacteria" jumped almost 70% between 2019 and 2023.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Flying blind"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO hailed improvements in surveillance but warned that 48 percent of countries still weren't reporting any AMR data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are definitely flying blind in a number of countries and regions that have insufficient surveillance systems for antimicrobial resistance," Hutin acknowledged.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judging from the available data, most resistance was found in places with weaker health systems and less surveillance, the WHO said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highest resistance was found in the Southeast Asian and Eastern Mediterranean regions, where one-in-three reported infections were resistant. In the African region, one-in-five infections were resistant. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silvia Bertagnolio, who heads the WHO unit for antimicrobial resistance surveillance, told reporters it wasn't surprising that resistance would be higher in places with weaker health systems, since they may lack the capacity to diagnose or treat pathogens effectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differences could also be linked to the fact that countries with less surveillance may test and provide data on fewer patients and only those with the most serious infections, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO has warned that there are not enough new tests and treatments in the pipeline to tackle the growing spread of drug-resistant bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is creating a significant "future threat," Hutin cautioned, adding that "the increasing antibiotic use, the increasing resistance and the reduction of the pipeline is a very dangerous combination."&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/section&gt;

The condition arises when the arteries located in the heart begin to narrow, making it more difficult for oxygen-rich blood to reach the heart muscle.

But in the world of prevention, there are a number of modifiable lifestyle and health factors where you make adjustments to reduce your risk for heart disease, says &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/karol-watson" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Karol Watson;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Karol Watson&lt;/a&gt;, the co-director of the UCLA Program in Preventive Cardiology and director of the UCLA Women's Cardiovascular Health Center. A few long-established modifiable risk factors for coronary heart disease include high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes and &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/11/19/surgeon-general-smoking-disparities-persist/76408802007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:smoking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In many past studies, the parameters that researchers used to define whether someone had a risk factor for heart disease was a clinical diagnosis, but it’s likely not that simple. Rather, risk factors operate on a more linear scale, says &lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=11644" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Philip Greenland;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Philip Greenland&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of cardiology at Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;New research reveals that the modifiable risk factors for coronary heart disease, even “at relatively low levels, can still convey risk,” says Greenland. According to a new study published in the &lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.07.014" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of the American College of Cardiology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Journal of the American College of Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;, 99% of the people who experienced a heart attack, stroke or heart failure had been exposed to at least one of the four risk factors – blood cholesterol, blood pressure, blood glucose or smoking — above an acceptable level. Greenland, who is one of the senior authors of the study, says it was important for researchers to evaluate multiple measurements, “because risk factors tend to fluctuate a little bit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study in JACC didn't depend on clinical diagnoses to determine one’s risk for high cholesterol, diabetes and high blood pressure. Instead, researchers repeatedly measured populations in both Korea and the U.S. to determine whether someone had a modest risk elevation for those factors. The results solidified the importance of recognizing these risk factors, even if they present at a relatively modest level, Greenland says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span class="exclude-from-newsgate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does a heart attack feel like? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/does-heart-attack-feel-heres-090052039.html" data-ylk="slk:Here's when to visit the ER.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Here's when to visit the ER.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Is heart disease preventable?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Health experts often estimate heart disease is &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2023/numbers-know-healthy-heart" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:at least 80% preventable;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;at least 80% preventable&lt;/a&gt;, Watson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People aren’t always aware of their risk for heart disease, especially if they haven’t “had their blood pressure checked in a while, or they don't know their cholesterol,” says Watson. But, if it’s detected that someone has an elevated cholesterol level, “then we are much more aggressive about treating their cholesterol, their blood pressure, their weight, diabetes, etc., in order to try to prevent them from having a heart attack down the road,” says Yang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The American Heart Association’s &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Life’s Essential 8;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Life’s Essential 8&lt;/a&gt; is a framework that details eight facets of cardiovascular health to consider: &lt;a href="https://health.yahoo.com/wellness/nutrition/diet-types/articles/could-mediterranean-diet-decrease-risk-090447548.html" data-ylk="slk:following a healthy dietary pattern;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;following a healthy dietary pattern&lt;/a&gt;, incorporating regular physician activity, quitting smoking, practicing good sleep hygiene, weight management and keeping an eye on your blood cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure levels.

On this day, someone to remember is Rudolf Virchow [1821-1902], a German physician, pathologist and politician, referred by his colleagues as the “Pope of Medicine.” His famous postulate: that for blood to clot, three factors are needed -- stagnation, injury to vessel wall and abnormalities in clotting mechanism -- remains unchallenged to this day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Understanding clotting&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clotting is important because it can be symptomless and yet cause sudden death. Clotting in the veins of the legs - &lt;a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/need-for-awareness-of-dvt/article257669.ece" target="_self"&gt;acute deep vein thrombosis&lt;/a&gt; in medical terms - which sometimes floats its way to the lungs (&lt;a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/prevent-the-preventable/article67551384.ece" target="_self"&gt;pulmonary embolism&lt;/a&gt;) is the most preventable cause of hospital deaths and a source of substantial long-term morbidity. About 120 of every 1 lakh persons are affected by this malady. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common causes of thrombosis are prolonged immobility due to trauma, spinal cord injuries resulting in paralysis, major neurosurgery, pelvic surgery or orthopaedic surgery, especially hip and knee replacement surgeries, and extended stays in intensive medical care units. Some diseases such as cancers and certain viral infections also interfere with the coagulation cascade and can promote a clot. The common viral infection H1N1, causes a 23.3-fold higher incidence of pulmonary embolisms and 19.9-fold higher incidence of deep vein thrombosis. A number of patients recovering from chicken pox, a viral disease, also present with clots in their legs. Drugs including oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies and some cancer drugs also promote clots in the veins.  Catheters left in the central veins for a prolonged period also promote clots. Physiological stagnation and clotting can also occur during pregnancy and the early postpartum period. Smoking is a definite cause for atherosclerosis as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;How clotting occurs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a person is immobile, blood stagnates in the veins of the legs, the soleal veins, and promotes clot formation in the valves present in those veins. This is worsened by inactivity of the calf muscles. Calf muscles act as a pump, pushing the blood upwards to the heart. They are considered the peripheral heart or second heart. Any form of mobility such as walking, climbing stairs, running or cycling pumps venous blood from the lower limbs towards the heart, and hence should be vigorously encouraged in normal populations as well as those convalescing from various diseases or recovering from major surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why clots in the legs are bad: first such a clot can detach itself from the walls of the leg veins, move all the way to the lungs, choke them and cause sudden death. Most often this is so sudden that there is no time to even plan a definite treatment to save these patients. Second, these clots can recanalise but also cause narrowing of the blood vessels of the lung. They may not end in sudden death but can cause severe breathlessness even with minimal exertion leading to pulmonary hypertension. And lastly, the leg veins and the valves where the clots form, can be permanently damaged.  They lose their capacity to pump blood upwards to the heart, leading to constant pooling of blood in these veins. The ‘second heart’ therefore is damaged forever. Rarely, massive thrombosis in leg veins can result in gangrene of the limb and even death. Hence prevention is the best primary choice, and in cases where a clot has occurred, very early diagnosis and prompt treatment to prevent the growth and migration of the clots and prevent vein valve damage is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Prevention and treatment&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does one prevent these dreadful clots? While prevention of vessel wall injury or inherent defects in the clotting mechanism may not be possible, stagnation can certainly be avoided through the aggressive promotion of physical exercises and adequate hydration to keep the blood optimally diluted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any exercise, starting from the simple tiptoe exercise to running, helps prevent stagnation. Prolonged immobility in any long-distance journey predisposes an individual to venous stagnation. Walking inside an aircraft especially in long-haul flights is a proven way to prevent clots, as is good hydration. Avoid alcohol on long flights because inebriation adds to immobility. If it is a car journey, break the journey every three or four hours get out and walk around a little, and stay hydrated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a surgery is planned, especially a knee or hip replacement, a discussion should be had with the surgeon about anti-clot protocols and early ambulation. Similarly, for those who are bed ridden for a long time, compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression devices are available. A doctor will be able to guide patients as to which one would be appropriate. In some instances, filters placed in the great vein, inferior vena cava, can prevent the migration of clots from the legs to the heart. There are very specific indications for such procedures and the treating doctor would be the best person to decide that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a clot in the leg veins is detected, prompt treatment is needed. In select cases, clot dissolving chemicals commonly known as clot busters, can prevent damage to the veins and vein valves. In severe cases, surgical removal of the clots from the lower limbs or from the pulmonary blood vessels may be lifesaving. A specialist is best placed to decide on treatment, depending on the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Move your limbs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all diseases and disorders, prevention is the best strategy. Stay hydrated, stay mobile and those who have inherent abnormalities in clotting factors should continue clot preventing medications unless specifically stopped by the treating doctor. Smoking and consumption of alcohol promote arterial thrombosis and are best avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(Dr. J.

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their research reveals why the first movements of electrons, which are crucial for transferring energy, occur through only one side of a key protein-pigment structure. The findings were published in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photosynthesis is a sequence of reactions in which electrons pass between multiple pigment molecules. Although it has been examined for decades, the process remains difficult to fully explain because it involves numerous intricate components, operates at extremely fast timescales, and varies slightly across different species. Gaining a deeper understanding of these steps could help scientists develop efficient artificial systems, such as synthetic leaves and solar-based fuel technologies, that replicate nature's design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most life forms that use photosynthesis, the process begins with a protein-pigment complex known as Photosystem II (PSII). This complex captures sunlight and splits water molecules, releasing oxygen and sending electrons onward to other molecules in the chain of energy transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PSII contains two nearly identical branches, known as D1 and D2, surrounded by four chlorophyll molecules and two related pigments called pheophytins. These are symmetrically arranged and connected to electron carriers known as plastoquinones. In theory, electrons should move from chlorophyll to pheophytin and then to plastoquinone along both branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, experiments have consistently shown that electrons move only through the D1 branch -- a finding that has baffled scientists for years. "Despite the structural symmetry between the D1 and D2 protein branches in PSII, only the D1 branch is functionally active," explains Aditya Kumar Mandal, the study's first author and a PhD student in the Department of Physics at IISc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate this imbalance, the team combined molecular dynamics simulations, quantum mechanical analyses, and Marcus theory (a Nobel Prize-winning model that describes how electrons are transferred) to chart the energy patterns in both pathways. "We assessed the electron transfer efficiency step-by-step through both D1 and D2 branches," says Shubham Basera, PhD student in the Department of Physics and one of the authors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that the D2 branch has a much higher energy barrier, which makes electron transport energetically unfavourable. Specifically, the transfer of electrons from pheophytin to plastoquinone in D2 requires twice as much activation energy as D1 -- a barrier that electrons seem unable to overcome, preventing energy from flowing forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also simulated the current-voltage characteristics of both branches and found that the resistance against electron movement in D2 was two orders of magnitude higher than that in D1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asymmetry in electron flow may also be influenced by subtle differences in the protein environment around the PSII and how the pigments are embedded in it, the researchers suggest. For example, the chlorophyll pigment in D1 has an excitation state at a lower energy than its D2 counterpart, suggesting that the D1 pigment has a better chance of attracting and transferring electrons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also suggest that tweaking some of these components can boost or rewire electron flow across PSII. For example, swapping chlorophyll and pheophytin in D2 could overcome the electron block, because chlorophyll needs lower activation energy than pheophytin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our research presents a significant step forward in understanding natural photosynthesis," says Prabal K Maiti, Professor at the Department of Physics and one of the corresponding authors of the study. "These findings may help design efficient artificial photosynthetic systems capable of converting solar energy into chemical fuels, contributing to innovative and sustainable renewable energy solutions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a beautiful combination of theory at various levels to address a long-standing problem culminating in a new level of understanding, but still leaving mysteries to be challenged, says Bill Goddard, Professor at Caltech and one of the corresponding authors.&lt;/p&gt;

Many fitness experts believe heavy lifting delivers faster results. However, a shocking warning by a CMC Vellore trained physician and top neurologist Dr. Sudhir Kumar, has cautioned everyone. Dr. Sudhir warned that during maximal weight lifting, blood pressure can rise to extremely high levels and can even surpass beyond 300 mmHg, especially when techniques like the Valsalva maneuver are used. Even though this is a temporary spike, the effects of this surge can lead to different consequences for different individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sudhir Kumar also mentioned that controlled studies with experienced bodybuilders have documented average peak systolic pressures of 320 mmHg during double-leg press exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Natural Ways to Control High Blood Pressure Effectively&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3980383/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;1985 study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;found that during maximal double-leg press exercise, the mean peak systolic blood pressure was 320 mmHg, with one subject's reading exceeding 480 mmHg. The researchers noted that these extreme elevations were transient and returned to baseline levels shortly after the exercise concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.asep.org/asep/asep/Gotshall.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;1999 research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; observed that blood pressure increased progressively with each subsequent set of heavy resistance exercises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peak systolic blood pressures were recorded as 238 mmHg in the first set, escalating to 293 mmHg by the third set, highlighting the cumulative cardiovascular stress during intense lifting sessions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies also demonstrate that heavy resistance exercises, particularly those involving large muscle groups like the double-leg press, can induce significant and transient elevations in systolic blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why blood pressure spikes during heavy lifting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;During heavy resistance training, particularly maximal lifts, the body undergoes significant cardiovascular stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcsportsscimedrehabil.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13102-025-01097-3" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;As per studies,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; one of the primary contributors to sudden spikes in blood pressure during such exercises is the Valsalva maneuver. When performing the Valsalva maneuver, intra-abdominal and intrathoracic pressures increase sharply, which helps stabilize the spine and provides a solid base for lifting heavy weights. However, this same pressure compresses major blood vessels, temporarily reducing venous return to the heart. As a result, the heart must work harder to pump blood through a partially restricted circulatory system, causing systolic blood pressure to spike dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who might face serious risks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his post, neurologist Dr. Sudhir adds, in a healthy person, with normal heart functions, this transient rise in BP does not lead to any adverse health issues. BP returns to normal levels soon after the exercise is over. However, the combination of high intrathoracic pressure and elevated BP means that individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, uncontrolled hypertension, or vascular abnormalities may face higher risks during these maneuvers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individuals with hypertension:&lt;/strong&gt; Those with pre-existing high blood pressure may experience exaggerated BP responses during intense lifting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Older adults:&lt;/strong&gt; Age-related changes in vascular elasticity can increase the risk of complications during heavy lifting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individuals with heart conditions:&lt;/strong&gt; Conditions like arrhythmias or heart disease can be exacerbated by significant BP fluctuations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Untrained individuals: &lt;/strong&gt;Lack of conditioning can lead to improper technique and increased cardiovascular strain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for healthy individuals, it is essential to practice proper breathing techniques and avoid breath-holding to minimize unnecessary strain on the cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transient warning signs of high blood pressure may include sudden or severe headaches, dizziness or lightheadedness, blurred vision, shortness of breath, chest pain or tightness, and even unexplained nosebleeds. Regular blood pressure monitoring, both at rest and during exercise when advised, is important to detect dangerous elevations early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Some recommendations for safe lifting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use controlled breathing techniques, exhaling during the exertion phase of the lift.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increase weights incrementally to allow the body to adapt to higher intensities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engage in light aerobic exercises and dynamic stretches before lifting to prepare the cardiovascular system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Individuals with known cardiovascular issues should regularly check their BP and consult healthcare providers before engaging in intense lifting sessions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For individuals at risk of extreme surge in blood pressure, there are several safer alternatives that can still build strength, improve fitness, and support overall health without the extreme BP spikes.

The findings, presented at the ECNP congress in Amsterdam, mark the first study to explain how ADHD and creativity are connected.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Han Fang (from the Radboud University Medical Centre, the Netherlands) explained:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Previous research pointed to mind wandering as a possible factor linking ADHD and creativity, but until now no study has directly examined this connection. We conducted two studies, utilizing 2 different groups of ADHD patients and healthy controls, one from a European group curated by the ECNP, and a second study from a UK group. In total there were 750 participants. Separately analyzing results from 2 independent groups means that we can have greater confidence in the results."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team explored how ADHD traits, creativity, and functional challenges interact, focusing on the influence of mind wandering. Both groups displayed typical ADHD traits, including inattention, impulsivity, and frequent shifts in focus away from the task at hand. In both studies, participants with more pronounced ADHD symptoms also reported higher levels of mind wandering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind wandering refers to moments when attention drifts away from what a person is doing and turns inward to self-generated thoughts. Everyone experiences this to some extent, but it occurs more frequently in individuals with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Han Fang added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Previous researchers have been able to distinguish two different types of mind wandering. It can be a loss of concentration, where your mind may drift from subject to subject. This is 'spontaneous mind-wandering'. Another type is 'deliberate mind wandering', where people give themselves the freedom to drift off-subject, where they 'allow their thoughts to take a different course'. Psychiatrists have developed ways of measuring how much people are subject to these different tendencies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also measured creativity in both groups (there are standards ways of measuring this, for example by asking people to find a creative use for an everyday object). They then looked at how creativity was associated with the different types of mind wandering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Han Fang said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that people with more ADHD traits such as lack of attention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity, score higher on creative achievements in both studies. This supports previous research. Additionally, we found that mind wandering, particularly deliberate mind wandering, where people allow their "thoughts to wander on purpose," was associated with greater creativity in people with ADHD. This suggests that mind wandering may be an underlying factor connecting ADHD and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may have practical implications, for both psychoeducation and treatment. For psychoeducation, specially designed programs or courses that teach individuals how to utilize their spontaneous ideas, for example turning them into creative outputs, could help individuals with ADHD traits harness the benefits of mind wandering. For treatment, ADHD-tailored mindfulness-based interventions that seek to decrease spontaneous mind wandering or transform it into more deliberate forms may reduce functional impairments and enhance treatment outcomes. This is the first time this link has been investigated, so we need to see more studies which confirm the findings."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commenting, K.P. Lesch (Professor of Molecular Psychiatry, University of Würzburg, Germany) said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Mind wandering is one of the critical resources on which the remarkable creativity of high-functioning ADHD individuals is based. This makes them such an incredibly valuable asset for our society and the future of our planet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The rate now mirrors that seen in younger adults, according to findings presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY® 2025 annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research is one of the first to use Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data to reveal that older adults -- often left out of overdose analyses -- are increasingly part of the national surge in fentanyl-stimulant deaths. People in this age group face higher risks of overdose because many manage chronic illnesses, take multiple medications, and metabolize drugs more slowly as they age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts describe the opioid epidemic as unfolding in four distinct "waves," each tied to a different drug driving fatal overdoses: prescription opioids in the 1990s, heroin beginning around 2010, fentanyl taking hold in 2013, and a combination of fentanyl and stimulants emerging in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A common misconception is that opioid overdoses primarily affect younger people," said Gab Pasia, M.A., lead author of the study and a medical student at the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine. "Our analysis shows that older adults are also impacted by fentanyl-related deaths and that stimulant involvement has become much more common in this group. This suggests older adults are affected by the current fourth wave of the opioid crisis, following similar patterns seen in younger populations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conduct the study, researchers examined 404,964 death certificates listing fentanyl as a cause of death from 1999 to 2023, using data from the CDC Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) system. Of those deaths, 17,040 involved adults 65 and older, while 387,924 were among adults aged 25 to 64.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 2015 and 2023, fentanyl-related deaths rose from 264 to 4,144 among older adults (a 1,470% increase) and from 8,513 to 64,694 among younger adults (a 660% increase). Within the older population, deaths involving both fentanyl and stimulants grew from 8.7% (23 of 264 fentanyl deaths) in 2015 to 49.9% (2,070 of 4,144) in 2023 -- a staggering 9,000% rise. In comparison, among younger adults, fentanyl-stimulant deaths rose from 21.3% (1,812 of 8,513) to 59.3% (38,333 of 64,694) over the same period, a 2,115% increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers chose to highlight 2015 and 2023 in their analysis because 2015 marked the beginning of the epidemic's fourth wave, when fentanyl-stimulant deaths among older adults were at their lowest, and 2023 represented the most recent year of CDC data available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that the rise in fentanyl deaths involving stimulants in older adults began to sharply rise in 2020, while deaths linked to other substances stayed the same or declined. Cocaine and methamphetamines were the most common stimulants paired with fentanyl among the older adults studied, surpassing alcohol, heroin, and benzodiazepines such as Xanax and Valium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"National data have shown rising fentanyl-stimulant use among all adults," said Mr. Pasia. "Because our analysis was a national, cross-sectional study, we were only able to describe patterns over time -- not determine the underlying reasons why they are occurring. However, the findings underscore that fentanyl overdoses in older adults are often multi-substance deaths -- not due to fentanyl alone -- and the importance of sharing drug misuse prevention strategies to older patients."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors noted anesthesiologists and other pain medicine specialists should:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Recognize that polysubstance use can occur in all age groups, not only in young adults.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Be cautious when prescribing opioids to adults 65 or older by carefully assessing medication history, closely monitoring patients prescribed opioids who may have a history of stimulant use for potential side effects, and considering non-opioid options when possible.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Use harm-reduction approaches such as involving caregivers in naloxone education, simplifying medication routines, using clear labeling and safe storage instructions and making sure instructions are easy to understand for those with memory or vision challenges.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Screen older patients for a broad range of substance exposures, beyond prescribed opioids, to better anticipate complications and adjust perioperative planning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Older adults who are prescribed opioids, or their caregivers, should ask their clinicians about overdose prevention strategies, such as having naloxone available and knowing the signs of an overdose," said Richard Wang, M.D., an anesthesiology resident at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago and co-author of the study. "With these trends in mind, it is more important than ever to minimize opioid use in this vulnerable group and use other pain control methods when appropriate. Proper patient education and regularly reviewing medication lists could help to flatten this terrible trend."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The arteries, that carry oxygen, promote blood circulation, can accumulate plaque over time, known as atherosclerosis. The accumulation of this cholesterol, fat or calcium, can clog the arteries, elevate blood pressure, can lead to a heart stroke or disease. While no "one drink" can help improve the build up of plaque, there are several that ensure a healthy blood flow to the arteries. This is done by reducing inflammation, lowering bad cholesterol and circulating more efficiently. It is to be noted that making plaque disappear is not possible, but with lifestyle changes it may can shrink and stabilize- (Harvard health)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Green Tea&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9871939/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Green tea &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;has been highly prized in conventional medicine for centuries, and most research confirms its excellent reputation for heart health. Its active ingredients, or catechins, are potent antioxidants that reduce LDL cholesterol and oxidative stress, two prime players in keeping plaque buildup to a minimum. Daily use of green tea also enhances endothelial function, or how the inner blood vessel wall functions. Endothelial function helps blood flow smoothly and makes arteries flexible. Research indicates that consuming two to three cups of freshly brewed green tea daily might reduce coronary artery disease risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packaged green tea is to be avoided since it contains added sugars, which will neutralize its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pomegranate Juice&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most potent natural antioxidants, like punicalagins and anthocyanins, that combat inflammation and oxidative stress in the arteries, is present in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3678830/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;pomegranate juice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. In a study conducted by National Library of Medicine, daily consumption of pomegranate juice was found to decrease the progression of plaque in carotid arteries and enhanced circulation.

Tuckey who is a tick-born disease specialist and clinician in Worthing said: "We have a particular way of understanding symptom presentation...that's what we're looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"And that isn't looked for generally in the context of NHS investigations," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;There are around 1,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of Lyme disease in England and Wales each year, although it is estimated that there are 3,000 to 4,000 patients treated by doctors without a confirmed diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Mrs Tuckey believes by only using 'laboratory-confirmed' data it "doesn't support investing" in Lyme research or training because the actual number of cases "should be much higher".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The UKHSA said: "We know that there are many more cases diagnosed on clinical grounds that receive treatment without testing… &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Further work is being carried out by UKHSA to get recent, updated data to gain further understanding of the incidence of Lyme

what is and isn't potentially associated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But Ella Haig who is a professor in Artificial Intelligence at Portsmouth University is more hesitant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;She said the only two things we can really control when looking for answers from AI is how much detail we put in, and asking the tool to restrict sources of information to official healthcare providers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"So yes we could use these tools, but would we really trust what they give us without a

laboratory-confirmed cases of Lyme disease in England and Wales each year, although it is estimated that there are 3,000 to 4,000 patients treated by doctors without a confirmed diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Mrs Tuckey believes by only using 'laboratory-confirmed' data it "doesn't support investing" in Lyme research or training because the actual number of cases "should be much higher".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The UKHSA said: "We know that there are many more cases diagnosed on clinical grounds that receive treatment without testing… &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Further work is being carried out by UKHSA to get recent, updated data to gain further understanding of the incidence of Lyme

what is and isn't potentially associated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But Ella Haig who is a professor in Artificial Intelligence at Portsmouth University is more hesitant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;She said the only two things we can really control when looking for answers from AI is how much detail we put in, and asking the tool to restrict

That is the key finding of PREDIMED-Plus, a large clinical trial led in Spain by the University of Navarra together with more than 200 researchers from 22 universities, hospitals, and research institutes. The project was carried out in over 100 primary care centers within Spain's National Health System.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched in 2013 after the University of Navarra received an Advanced Grant of over €2 million from the European Research Council (ERC), PREDIMED-Plus is the largest nutrition trial ever conducted in Europe. Between 2014 and 2016, additional institutions joined the effort, bringing total funding above 15 million euros. Most of the support came from the Carlos III Health Institute (ISCIII) and the Center for Biomedical Research Network (CIBER), through its divisions on Physiopathology of Obesity and Nutrition (CIBEROBN), Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP), and Diabetes and Associated Metabolic Diseases (CIBERDEM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, followed 4,746 adults between the ages of 55 and 75 who were overweight or obese and had metabolic syndrome but no prior history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Over six years, researchers compared two groups. One group adopted a calorie-reduced Mediterranean diet (about 600 fewer kilocalories per day), engaged in moderate exercise such as brisk walking and strength and balance training, and received professional counseling. The other group continued a traditional Mediterranean diet without calorie limits or exercise advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results revealed that the participants who followed the calorie-reduced diet and exercise plan not only reduced their diabetes risk but also lost more weight and trimmed more from their waistlines. On average, they lost 3.3 kg and 3.6 cm from their waist, compared to 0.6 kg and 0.3 cm in the control group. This translated to preventing about three new cases of type 2 diabetes for every 100 participants -- a meaningful benefit for public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Diabetes is the first solid clinical outcome for which we have shown -- using the strongest available evidence -- that the Mediterranean diet with calorie reduction, physical activity and weight loss is a highly effective preventive tool," said Miguel Ángel Martínez-González, Professor of Preventive Medicine and Public Health at the University of Navarra, Adjunct Professor of Nutrition at Harvard University, and one of the principal investigators of the project. "Applied at scale in at-risk populations, these modest and sustained lifestyle changes could prevent thousands of new diagnoses every year. We hope soon to show similar evidence for other major public health challenges."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type 2 Diabetes: A Preventable Global Epidemic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the International Diabetes Federation, type 2 diabetes now affects over 530 million people around the world. Its rise is fueled by urbanization (unhealthy diets, sedentary lifestyles, reduced physical activity), an aging population, and increasing rates of overweight and obesity. In Spain, an estimated 4.7 million adults live with diabetes -- mostly type 2 -- giving the country one of the highest rates in Europe, where total cases exceed 65 million. In the United States, roughly 38.5 million people have diabetes, and the disease carries some of the highest per-patient healthcare costs worldwide. Experts emphasize that prevention is crucial to slow this escalating crisis, which greatly increases the risk of heart, kidney, and metabolic complications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Mediterranean diet acts synergistically to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation. With PREDIMED-Plus, we demonstrate that combining calorie control and physical activity enhances these benefits," explained Miguel Ruiz-Canela, Professor and Chair of Preventive Medicine and Public Health Department at the University of Navarra's School of Medicine and first author of the study. "It is a tasty, sustainable and culturally accepted approach that offers a practical and effective way to prevent type 2 diabetes -- a global disease that is, to a large extent, avoidable."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International Relevance and Support for a Realistic and Scalable Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine accompanied the publication with an editorial by Sharon J. Herring and Gina L. Tripicchio, nutrition and public health experts at Temple University (Philadelphia, USA). They praised the intervention's clinical relevance and its potential as a preventive model for type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, they warn that replicating similar strategies outside the Mediterranean context -- such as in the U.S. -- requires overcoming structural barriers, including unequal access to healthy foods, the limitations of the urban environment, and the lack of professional guidance. In this scenario, they advocate strengthening public policies that promote more nutritious and more equitable environments. At a time when new drugs against obesity and diabetes are grabbing headlines, PREDIMED-Plus demonstrates that modest, sustained lifestyle changes can still deliver powerful health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PREDIMED-Plus project (2013-2024), which involves different patients, is a continuation of the PREDIMED study (2003-2010). This study demonstrated that following a Mediterranean diet enriched with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease by 30%. Researchers emphasize that primary care providers can integrate the new intervention as a sustainable, cost-efficient strategy to prevent type 2 diabetes on a large scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participating Institutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PREDIMED-Plus trial has assembled a broad network of investigators from across Spain. In order of the number of participants, the study included researchers from the following institutions: the University of Navarra and the Navarra Health Service (2 centers), Hospital Clínic de Barcelona (2 centers), University of Valencia, Rovira i Virgili University (Reus), IMIM-Hospital del Mar, Miguel Hernández University (Alicante), Son Espases Hospital (Palma de Mallorca), University of Malaga, Reina Sofía Hospital (Córdoba) and University of Granada.

New research suggests microplastic pollution may play a startling role in increasing women's reproductive cancer risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Scientists have been increasingly concerned that microplastics — tiny particles resulting from plastic degradation — pose &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2025/01/microplastics-in-body-polluted-tiny-plastic-fragments.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:serious risks to human health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;serious risks to human health&lt;/a&gt;. These microscopic particles have been detected all over the human body, including in reproductive tissue, raising alarm about their health impacts. While their widespread presence is undeniable, the full extent of their impact on human health is still being uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, a team of researchers in China recently published the "first systematic profiling of microplastics in endometrial cancer tissues." According to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749125013788" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/endometrium" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:endometrium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;endometrium&lt;/a&gt; — the lining of the uterus — may be more likely to trap microplastics because of its constant "remodeling" and many blood vessels. And that could have devastating impacts on women's reproductive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For the study, scientists analyzed 32 endometrial tissue samples from cancer and cancer-free patients. Microplastics were found in every sample, showing how common the pollutant is in human reproductive tissue. But notably, the endometrial cancer tissues contained significantly higher levels of microplastics than normal — or non-cancerous — endometrial tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The researchers also discovered that increased microplastic presence was strongly correlated with disruptions in "cancer-related metabolic pathways." In other words, high concentrations of microplastics appeared to change the way &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/metabolic-pathways-metabolic-conditioning" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cells use and process;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;cells use and process&lt;/a&gt; nutrients and energy. These shifts can make cells behave abnormally — growing faster, surviving longer, or evading immune defenses. All these behavior changes are &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12194-cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hallmarks of cancer development;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;hallmarks of cancer development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Especially impacted were pathways regulating tumor proliferation and immune function, per the study. This suggests that microplastics may not only accumulate in endometrial tissues but could also contribute to processes that drive cancer progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this finding important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This new study suggests that microplastics could play a concerning role in the development of endometrial cancer, which is a big deal for understanding reproductive health risks. By showing how microplastics accumulate in endometrial cancer tissues and alter cell behavior, the study raises urgent questions about the broader impacts of microplastic pollution on women's reproductive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The scale of human exposure to microplastics is startling. A 2020 study found that humans inhale approximately &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/humans-inhale-the-equivalent-of-a-credit-card-in-microplastics-each-week/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:16.2 bits of microplastics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;16.2 bits of microplastics&lt;/a&gt; every hour. That's the equivalent of a credit card per week. According to the &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/01/what-s-the-deal-with-microplastics-the-material-that-never-goes-away#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20European%20Union,change%20things%2C%E2%80%9D%20she%20said." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stanford Report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Stanford Report&lt;/a&gt;, 10 to 40 million metric tons of microplastics are released into the environment every year. Microplastics never truly disappear, polluting water, soil, air — everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While scientists are still piecing together the full impact of microplastics, it's clear these particles cause lasting harm. &lt;a href="https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/microplastics-everywhere" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Harvard Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Harvard Medicine&lt;/a&gt; highlights that microplastic exposure has been linked to a range of human health impacts, including cancer, inflammation, lung and liver problems, hormone disruptions, and changes to gut microbiomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With new evidence connecting microplastics to reproductive cancers, the need to confront global reliance on plastics continues to increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about microplastic exposure?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The researchers hope their findings can be a basis for future research into microplastics as emerging risk factors for women's reproductive health. Right now, it's clear more research is needed to understand the link between microplastics and reproductive cancers — along with continued research into the health implications of plastic pollution in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As scientists work to understand the health implications of microplastic exposure, there are already global efforts to &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduce plastic usage;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;reduce plastic usage&lt;/a&gt;. But given how deeply plastic is woven into daily lives, avoiding microplastics altogether isn't realistic. The pervasive particles are everywhere — in food, water, air, and even clothes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, there are simple ways to reduce your microplastic exposure. Choose clothing made from &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/support-eco-friendly-clothing-brands/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:natural fibers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;natural fibers&lt;/a&gt;, skip &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/ditch-plastic-food-containers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plastic food packaging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;plastic food packaging&lt;/a&gt;, and bring &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/ditch-plastic-grocery-bags/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reusable bags;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;reusable bags&lt;/a&gt; to the store instead of relying on single-use plastic bags.

Researchers describe the trend as “very marked increases” in death rates for some countries. The worrying sign: in many countries, death rates for young people are not falling as fast as for older groups — and in some places, they are rising. While Regional causes differ, some patterns stand out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;North America and parts of Latin America:&lt;/strong&gt; In these parts of the world, rising deaths are linked with mental health issues, especially among young women. Suicide, drug overdoses, alcohol misuse, and self-harm are key drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sub-Saharan Africa:&lt;/strong&gt; The leading causes of death in this region include preventable infectious diseases, unintentional injuries, maternal risks (for women), and gaps in health systems (e.g., vaccine access, emergency care).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infectious and injury causes:&lt;/strong&gt; In low-income settings, factors like road traffic accidents, lack of access to care for infections (HIV, malaria, tuberculosis), and maternal health issues are prominent and contributing factors to the death rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previously undercounted mortality:&lt;/strong&gt; The new modeling suggests that previous estimates of deaths in ages 5-14 were underestimated, meaning the trend is steeper than known. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These trends are especially alarming because the young have traditionally seen the fastest declines in mortality over decades. In richer nations, mental health struggles are seen playing an outsized role. Meanwhile, in lower-income settings, limited access to health care, weak health systems, road safety issues, and persistent infectious disease burdens continue to kill young people prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 02:41:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>新的慢性疲劳综合征“血液测试”提高了希望和怀疑- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/new-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-blood-test-raises-hope-and-skepticism</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

For the first time, we have a simple blood test that can reliably identify ME/CFS – potentially transforming how we diagnose and manage this complex disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-blood-test-for-chronic-fatigue-looks-promising-but-it-s-too-early-to-be-certain"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Chronic Fatigue Blood Test Looks Increasingly Promising, But It's Still Early Days&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings raise hope for those seeking answers to their chronic pain, dizziness, and flu-like symptoms, but several independent experts and organizations remain wary of those numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alastair Miller, a retired physician not involved in the study, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-of-blood-based-diagnostic-biomarkers-for-me-cfs/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that level of accuracy is "almost unheard of for this sort of test, so this is quite a remarkable claim."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My worry is that it will prove to be yet another false dawn, launched with a huge amount of hype and will raise patients' expectations unrealistically," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-of-blood-based-diagnostic-biomarkers-for-me-cfs/"&gt;adds&lt;/a&gt; Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176975" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176975" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/438164955_463339799575976_6465903014215761153_n-642x642.jpg" alt="ME Research UK" class="size-medium wp-image-176975" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/438164955_463339799575976_6465903014215761153_n-642x642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/438164955_463339799575976_6465903014215761153_n-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/438164955_463339799575976_6465903014215761153_n-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/438164955_463339799575976_6465903014215761153_n-600x600.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/438164955_463339799575976_6465903014215761153_n.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-176975" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;ME/CFS symptoms.

Still, the "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-025-07203-w"&gt;strong systemic&lt;/a&gt;" signal found in severely affected patients was only 'strong' when compared against healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study did not analyze the blood of those with moderate or mild CFS/ME, or patients with other conditions that can cause similar symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are both necessary steps to a proper diagnostic test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applied statistician Kevin McConway, who was not involved in the study, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-of-blood-based-diagnostic-biomarkers-for-me-cfs/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; that "there's no guarantee" as to how the test would work for people with other chronic illnesses, like cancers or autoimmune conditions.&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_astro"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Astronaut in space, with text overlay" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-177074" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, scientists &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-025-06146-6"&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; the current research on CFS/ME blood biomarkers, concluded that while no practical test yet exists, emerging results show promise for future clinical use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When that day will come is unknown. For years now, scientists around the world have tested &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-blood-test-for-chronic-fatigue-looks-promising-but-it-s-too-early-to-be-certain"&gt;different approaches&lt;/a&gt; to diagnosing CFS/ME with varying levels of success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent research from UEA and Oxford Biodynamics relies on  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/epigenetic-changes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73027" data-postid="176963" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epigenetic changes&lt;/a&gt;, which occur when our environment or behavior alters the way our genes are expressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an existing platform called Episwitch®, the team tested epigenetic regulators in 47 patients with severe CFS/ME and 61 healthy individuals of the same age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using 200 of these markers, tests could correctly pick the person with CFS/ME 96 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EpiSwitch® has already been used to create clinical tests for prostate  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="176963" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, using this same logic. But one of the reasons CFS/ME is so difficult to diagnose is that its symptoms are highly variable in just about every way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, it's unknown whether all patients are suffering from the same underlying cause or if a variety of causes are contributing to the same pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also numerous crossovers with other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://meassociation.org.uk/2025/10/blood-test-can-detect-me-cfs-uea-researchers-claim/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on the recent research, officials at the ME Association UK say that epigenetic profiling is "an important step forward in the search for a diagnostic blood test."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, an effective diagnostic test should be highly sensitive and specific to that condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this case, we therefore need to know whether the abnormality is consistently present in the very early stages of ME/CFS as well as in people with longstanding disease who have mild or moderate ME/CFS," they &lt;a href="https://meassociation.org.uk/2025/10/blood-test-can-detect-me-cfs-uea-researchers-claim/"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consequently, further research needs to be carried out to properly validate and repeat these findings before concluding that we do now have a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic blood test for ME/CFS."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-025-07203-w"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journal of Translational Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet millions of people unknowingly sabotage their sleep through subtle habits. Longevity enthusiast and tech entrepreneur &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/bryan-johnson" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Bryan Johnson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; recently outlined six habits that can significantly interfere with sleep. Learning about these habits can encourage gradual changes that lead to better nights and brighter mornings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Late eating interferes with the &lt;keyword id="20016193" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="circadian-rhythm" source="keywords"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you eat just before going to bed, your body struggles to shift into sleep mode. Digestion is metabolically demanding and uses a lot of energy, which can make it difficult to fall asleep or result in a restless night. Eating several hours before bedtime allows your body to focus on repair instead of digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Missing a calming pre-sleep ritual&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going straight from a busy day to bed without any time to unwind can leave your mind active and restless. Bryan emphasizes the importance of having a relaxing routine before sleep. This could include reading a book, practicing mindfulness, or doing light stretches. A consistent wind-down routine helps signal to the brain that it is time to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Drinking stimulants too close to bedtime&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine and other stimulants can make it harder to fall asleep. Even if you do not feel jittery, these substances stay in the body for several hours and may disrupt deeper stages of sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing caffeine intake in the late afternoon and evening increases the likelihood of falling asleep more easily and sleeping more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exposure to bright light at night interferes with sleep&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light exposure in the evening, especially from TVs, computers, and phones, can suppress melatonin, the hormone that helps you sleep. Bryan recommends dimming lights in the evening and avoiding screens at least one hour before bed. Using warmer-colored lights also helps your body prepare for sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Temperature plays a vital role in sleep quality&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your sleep environment greatly affects how well you rest. A room that is too hot or too cold can cause frequent awakenings and make it harder to stay asleep. Johnson suggests keeping your bedroom cool and comfortable to allow for uninterrupted, restorative sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Noise disruptions break the sleep cycle&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loud or sudden noises, such as traffic or noisy neighbors, can disturb deep sleep even if you do not fully wake up. Creating a quiet sleep environment by using earplugs, white noise machines, or soundproofing can help protect your sleep and improve overall rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can we do instead?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve sleep, try finishing your dinner at least two to three hours before going to bed. This gives your body enough time to digest and settle. Before sleep, include a calming activity like reading, meditation, or gentle stretching. These small lifestyle adjustments can lead to better quality sleep and more refreshed mornings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7AFBVV95cUxPNVhLVVVMUVBHQ01BM0RMcklqcmRvRXlmbWhQbm9yVmNZTHh5aTdXeUZVbGtZcE9XR0Z5b0xpTjdBakgtZjBPVnlPU0FoQzBFR3ZNRzNUQUFxLU9oOEtESFd6V3NrU2xNU2YwSmp6LUdxampULUtYOVM2WDZVTHV4MXZ5VUlGRE54dGdSZWc4M2dDdU5UbFplMk1sQkJ1c3ZwMGgxWWF2LW9jRGJ0QkZkMUVHNUlROVY0WEg2MkRJLU5FXzRFVjVzaXMxS0IzTTJqcmY2WWVOeDRmYTZndjJxdW43eGRqc2FWYkhPSA</guid></item><item><title>南卡罗来纳州150多名未接种疫苗的学生在麻疹暴露后进行隔离- ABC新闻-突发新闻、最新新闻和视频</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/US/150-unvaccinated-students-south-carolina-quarantining-after-measles/story?id=126459506</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside class="InlineElement InlineElement--content-width InlineElement--desktop InlineVideo FeaturedVideo" aria-label="Video"&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU eEzcu lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Boxes and vials of the Measles, Mumps, Rubella Virus Vaccine at a vaccine clinic put on by Lubbock Public Health Department, March 1, 2025, in Lubbock, Texas. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh YxlyB "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News - Breaking News, Latest News and Videos</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 01:18:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQNndxZGsxYTRCaVlSQ1lmRGZIZ3ZiNjJLWGxwUllENUdWQi0ySE0weGViMk9fajVYNWlORlNWWE9YSTBvR1lPY2p4WU5LbDMzdmE1VXpSVEZLNUt6SWtKZTFFVFVHdF9EV2VHcGpDQmp3ZVpDd0luU1dRQkNRVWNLNDRwbUw0TlRWU3ppaWFWUlJmb3ptWXF3d1JLcGRDYUhJM25qcGtMbk0tYndPdTJsVjJB0gG3AUFVX3lxTFAweERMVkJDVXM0eHI4TmhkWWlONGJ0Y3dMeWN3TDlmNmJ3M3NYelRlamwtZTZzTWtoUlk3bk4zTlpXX2hkaGJlTU91N05Ndy1RMGtHYnd3dXBZTU9QTW9IZWR0eDRsZ3Y3WDg2OU02NGRhdTZkRVpHaHl1b0Z4ZWdlTGx3WloyZ0h2S0F1OF82ak1Ec0J3YXZ6dDNZc2FJSERqWkJYWnEteUhsQlRNWm1OcGhMNW5Xcw</guid></item><item><title>美国麻疹病例继续攀升，全国各地爆发- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/10/12/nx-s1-5572507/us-measles-outbreaks-texas-south-carolina-utah-minnesota</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Nearly two months after a deadly, massive measles outbreak in Texas was &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;declared over,&lt;/a&gt; the highly contagious disease continues to spread across the country. The U.S. has now confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;1,563 cases&lt;/a&gt; this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the highest annual number &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5461155/measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccination-health" target="_blank"&gt;in more than three decades&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the true total could be even higher, says &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Paul Offit&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you talk to people on the ground, including not only in Texas, but other states, they all say the same thing, which is that the numbers are much worse than that. Probably closer to 5,000 cases," Offit says. "And it's not done."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;He points to the current outbreak in South Carolina, where more than 150 unvaccinated schoolchildren at two schools are now subject to a 21-day quarantine after being exposed to measles. The state Department of Public Health this past week &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/dph-confirms-states-11th-measles-case-greenville-county-eighth-related-current-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;reported the eighth confirmed measles&lt;/a&gt; case since Sept. 25. Public health officials say it's not clear if that new case, in Greenville County, is linked to seven cases that are part of a current outbreak in neighboring Spartanburg County, S.C.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"What this new case tells us is that there is active, unrecognized community transmission of measles occurring," &lt;a href="https://studysc.org/sc-people/linda-bell" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Linda Bell&lt;/a&gt;, South Carolina's state epidemiologist, told reporters during a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baOoDM-Bn2g" target="_blank"&gt;briefing&lt;/a&gt; Thursday. She said that makes it vital that the public receive the recommended measles vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a large measles outbreak along the border areas of Arizona and southwestern Utah continues to grow, with Utah now &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" target="_blank"&gt;reporting 55 cases&lt;/a&gt; this year as of Friday. Nearly all of the cases occurred in people who were unvaccinated. Six people required hospitalization. According to the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, wastewater testing shows that the measles virus is more widespread in the state than previously known. In neighboring Arizona, officials have reported &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;63 cases&lt;/a&gt; so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And in Minnesota, officials last week reported that a small, recent surge in measles cases there has brought the state's &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/measles/stats.html" target="_blank"&gt;total for the year to 20&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;All told, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;has confirmed&lt;/a&gt; 44 measles outbreaks in 41 states this year. The agency defines an outbreak as three or more cases that are linked.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The vast majority of cases were in people who were unvaccinated; 27% percent have been in children under the age of 5. About 1 in 8 measles cases have resulted in hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Widespread vaccination in the U.S. has saved hundreds of lives each year&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312088/measles-texas-outbreak-contagious-spread" target="_blank"&gt;contagious diseases&lt;/a&gt; known to humans. On average, an infected person will infect as many as 18 other unvaccinated people. A person with measles can emit infectious particles that linger in the air for up to two hours, long after they've left a room. That's why it's so highly transmissible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Before widespread vaccination, pretty much everyone got measles in childhood. And 400-500 people in the U.S. used to die from it each year.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The disease was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000. To protect communities against outbreaks, they need a vaccination rate of 95%, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nationwide, measles vaccination rates have been slipping for years — &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;they're currently at 92.5%&lt;/a&gt;. The trend predates the current administration, but Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease specialist in New York City, says it doesn't help that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has a long history of criticizing vaccines. Ratner notes that acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill has suggested breaking up the standard measles, mumps and rubella vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5563869/cdc-covid-vaccine-recommendation" target="_blank"&gt;into three separate shots&lt;/a&gt;, which Ratner says is neither feasible nor is it backed by data.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's no wonder that parents are, you know, confused and frightened," says Ratner, the author of &lt;em&gt;Booster Shots&lt;/em&gt;, a history of the fight against measles and its recent resurgence.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In some communities, kindergarten vaccination rates are much lower than the national average. That's created pockets of opportunity for measles to spread, Ratner says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If a measles case comes into a place with a low vaccination rate, it can really take off," Ratner says. "That's what we saw in Gaines County" — the epicenter of the Texas outbreak that saw &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;762 cases and two deaths&lt;/a&gt; — "and that's what we're seeing in lots of places."&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, according to a study published in the May 2025 edition of the American Journal of Emergency Medicine this is true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study examined 22 studies that analysed 54 cases of "beauty parlor stroke syndrome" across five decades, and determined that the cause of this was the Beauty parlor stroke syndrome (BPSS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Beauty parlor stroke syndrome?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

This causes the vertebral arteries in the neck that supply blood to the brain, to compress or tear.

According to Smith, the stroke led her vertebrae to "cut her vertebral artery" which has caused "unsteady gait and loss of motor skills in her left hand" along with an impairment in the left eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is advised to ask for salons to provide and clients to ask for neck support in the form of rolled towels or cushions to help clients sit more upright during washes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 00:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>曼彻斯特和其他地方的歌唱假牙- Hackaday</title><link>https://hackaday.com/2025/10/12/the-singing-dentures-of-manchester-and-other-places/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" id="post-864784" class="post-864784 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-radio-hacks tag-radio tag-radio-receiver tag-teeth"&gt;
    

    &lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Any radio amateur will tell you about the spectre of TVI, of their transmissions being inadvertently demodulated by the smallest of non-linearity in the neighbouring antenna systems, and spewing forth from the speakers of all and sundry. It’s very much a thing that the most unlikely of circuits can function as radio receivers, but… teeth? [Ringway Manchester] &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0zrGnlrm-s" target="_blank"&gt;investigates tales of musical dental work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going through a series of news reports over the decades, including one of Lucille Ball uncovering a hidden Japanese spy transmitter, it’s something all experts who have looked at the issue have concluded there is little evidence for. It was also investigated by Mythbusters. But it’s an alluring tale, so is it entirely fabricated? What we can say is that teeth are sensitive to sound, not in themselves, but because the jaw provides a good path bringing vibrations to the region of the ear. And it’s certainly possible that the active chemical environment surrounding a metal filling in a patient’s mouth could give rise to electrical non-linearities. But could a human body in an ordinary RF environment act as a good enough antenna to provide enough energy for something to happen? We have our doubts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a perennial story (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGBla6TAH7o" target="_blank"&gt;even in fiction&lt;/a&gt;), though, and we’re guessing that proof will come over the coming decades. If the tales of dental music and DJs continue after AM (or Long Wave in Europe) transmissions &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/06/07/am-the-original-speech-transmission-mode/"&gt;have been turned off&lt;/a&gt;, then it’s likely they’re more in the mind than in the mouth. If not, then we might have missed a radio phenomenon. The video is below the break.&lt;/p&gt;

Ischemic stroke, which makes up about 87 percent of all strokes, results from a clot that blocks a blood vessel supplying the brain, starving brain cells of oxygen and nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hemorrhagic Stroke accounts for the other 13 percent of strokes, occurring when a weakened blood vessel ruptures and bleeds into the surrounding brain. The leading culprit for both types is high blood pressure, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13992723/Half-Americans-silent-killer-condition-CDC-warns.html"&gt;the 'silent killer&lt;/a&gt;.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While strokes can seem to appear suddenly, many of the risks that lead to them are built by the decisions people make every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon at &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/massachusetts/index.html" id="mol-2c6fec40-a612-11f0-b94b-535ba609e711"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; General Hospital, told the Daily Mail: ‘[Younger people seeing rising rates of stroke] is because people are overall, especially with the western diet, sedentary lifestyle and some of the diseases that we know plague our society, unfortunately getting sicker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We also know that access to health care is difficult, especially for the population that's working in the gig economy, because they don't get health insurance from employers. So what that means is, if something's wrong with them, usually starting in their 30s, 40s, 50s, they pay for it in their 60s and 70s.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That extended time at one’s desk, the convenience of processed meals and putting off preventive care are active contributors to stroke risk. But by making targeted, manageable adjustments to these common areas, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14563743/Siobhan-Mclernon-nurse-five-habits-brain-stroke.html"&gt;people can actively shield&lt;/a&gt; their health and dramatically improve their long-term outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A sedentary desk life, a processed food diet, and skipped doctors appointments are active drivers of stroke risk (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Incidence of stroke had been on a steady decline among over-50s since the 1990s before plateauing and then rising in recent years, according to American Heart Association data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite a 20 to 30 percent drop in individual risk for older adults since 1990, the total number of strokes in this group has risen sharply due to an ever-growing senior population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Younger adults, meanwhile, are seeing a grim rise. While stroke incidence has fallen for those over 50, it is moving in the opposite direction for adults aged 15 to 49, particularly in specific states across the South and Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The alarming shift suggests that modern risk factors, such as rising rates of obesity, hypertension and diabetes in younger populations, are now outpacing the medical advances that have protected older generations, signaling a new and urgent public health challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prolonged sitting disrupts the metabolism, raising blood sugar and triglycerides (fat in the blood) while lowering good cholesterol, damaging blood vessels and promoting the accumulation of artery-clogging plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, stagnant blood flow in the legs increases the risk of clots, which can travel to the brain and cause a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dua said: ‘Our jobs are pretty sedentary, and that leads to other problems, like diabetes, high blood pressure, of course, and smoking; and while it is overall decreasing, is still very, very prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And these three risk factors, the diabetes, the smoking and the high blood pressure, specifically the high blood pressure, are the primary causes of damage to the inside lining of blood vessels.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Dr Anahita Dua, a prominent vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital, told the Daily Mail that sedentary jobs contribute directly to major health issues like diabetes and high blood pressure, noting that smoking also remains a widespread problem. These factors are primary culprits that damage the inner lining of blood vessels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A diet heavy in processed and fast foods launches continuous assaults on the cardiovascular system, primarily through a massive sodium load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dua said: ‘Certain processed foods that are high, not only in sodium, which causes high blood pressure, but also saturated fat, for example, bacon, really have a serious impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Now, anything in moderation is fine, but obviously, if you couple that with a genetic predisposition to having these diseases, you have a problem, right?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excess salt raises blood pressure by increasing blood volume, which over time damages arteries and makes them prone to rupture or clots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Salty, processed foods are often loaded with unhealthy saturated and trans fats, which contribute to the buildup of atherosclerotic plaque. This narrows the arteries and forces the heart to work even harder, further elevating blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The combination of hardened, narrowed arteries and chronically high pressure creates a prime environment for ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Ignoring hypertension (high blood pressure) allows it to damage the arteries, compounding the damage exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dua said: ‘[Young people] who are not necessarily in a steady, run-of-the-mill job that's 40 hours a week that's giving them health insurance, couple that with the money that they probably make on and off on in the gig economy… that's not somebody that's going to be buying fresh fruits and vegetables and preparing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So what are they eating? They're eating the hardcore processed meals, high in all these things, the sodium, the fat … and unfortunately, that translates to high blood pressure.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoking is another daily habit that, over time, drastically increases one’s risk of suffering a stroke. Neurologists reported in 2011 that current smokers have at least a two- to four-fold increased risk of stroke compared with lifelong nonsmokers or individuals who had quit smoking more than 10 years prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;From 2001 until the early 2010s, stroke death rates fell significantly across all US regions. But this graph shows that progress has stalled and reversed. After 2020, stroke death rates began to rise again in every region&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The chemicals in tobacco smoke directly impact the cardiovascular system by damaging vessel walls, thickening the blood and speeding up plaque accumulation, creating a triple threat for triggering a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Consistently sleeping fewer than six hours also significantly increases stroke risk. One major study of 90,000 older women found that short sleepers had a 22 percent higher risk of ischemic stroke, a link that was strongest in those who were otherwise healthy, indicating poor sleep is an independent risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This pattern held across demographics, with other large studies confirming that short sleep can more than double stroke risk in both men and women of various ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Sleep is directly associated with regeneration of your body,’ Dr Dua said. ‘In these people that have injury to the blood vessel for whatever the reason may be, if they're not getting appropriate sleep, they're not able to regenerate and heal whatever injury they initially sustained. That translates to continuing the process that ultimately leads to stroke.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Skipping routine health screenings is another dangerous gamble with one’s long-term health, Dr Dua added. Regular check-ups are the most crucial line of defense and act as an early warning system for silent but deadly conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time symptoms finally appear, the underlying disease may already be in an advanced stage. Early detection allows for timely intervention through lifestyle changes or medication, which can stop the progression of vascular disease and dramatically reduce the risk of a future heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Early detection allows for timely intervention through lifestyle changes or medication, which can stop the progression of vascular disease and dramatically reduce the risk of a future heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Added sugar pushes blood pressure higher, drives visceral fat, and nudges blood glucose past healthy limits. For most people, swapping table sugar for something less taxing could be a small shift with outsized benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that the switch might already be sitting on the breakfast table. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers looked at what happens when adults trade two tablespoons of refined sugar for an equal amount of pure maple syrup, and the results point to improvements in several early warning signs of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/strawberries-promote-cardiometabolic-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiometabolic&lt;/a&gt; trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sugar-has-invaded-our-lives"&gt;Sugar has invaded our lives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans swallow about 17 teaspoons of added sugar each day, roughly two to three times the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;’s recommended cap for men and women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health guidelines urge keeping added sugars below ten percent of daily calories and, ideally, closer to six percent for better heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting back is easier when the replacement tastes familiar. Maple syrup fits the bill but offers more than sweetness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have cataloged more than 67 &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-polyphenols-promote-heart-health-youthful-skin-and-a-healthy-waistline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polyphenols&lt;/a&gt; in the amber liquid alongside minerals, vitamins, and amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-maple-syrup-vs-sugar-the-test"&gt;Maple syrup vs. sugar – the test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest work, led by Dr. André Marette at Laval University’s &lt;a href="https://www.iucpq.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Quebec Heart and Lung Institute&lt;/a&gt; and Dr. Marie-Claude Vohl at the Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods (&lt;a href="https://www.inaf.ulaval.ca/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;INAF&lt;/a&gt;), enrolled 42 volunteers aged 18 to 75 with body mass index values between 23 and 40. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each person replaced five percent of daily calories – about two tablespoons – with either Canadian maple syrup or a flavored sucrose syrup for eight weeks. After a four-week washout, the groups switched syrups so every participant served as their own control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know from decades of research that maple syrup is more than just sugar. It contains over 100 natural compounds, including polyphenols, that are known to prevent disease in part through their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/coffee-with-milk-has-powerful-anti-inflammatory-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anti-inflammatory effects&lt;/a&gt;,” remarked Dr. Marette. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the fundamental chemistry of maple syrup is unique, they wondered if ingesting maple syrup instead of an equivalent amount of refined sugar would differently impact cardiometabolic health and the intestinal microbiota in humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Marette, “The results were extremely encouraging. I did not expect to see so many improvements of risk factors within a relatively short treatment period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-surprising-shifts-in-key-markers"&gt;Surprising shifts in key markers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eight weeks on maple syrup, participants handled an &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/meal-time-has-a-major-influence-on-our-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oral glucose&lt;/a&gt; tolerance test far better than when they consumed the sucrose syrup, showing a change of -50.59 versus +29.93. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systolic blood pressure edged down by -2.72 millimeters of mercury, while it crept up +0.87 millimeters on the sucrose phase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Android fat mass – deep abdominal fat linked to heart disease – dropped -7.83 grams on maple syrup but rose +67.61 grams with refined sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Both individually and collectively, the study findings are quite significant. The combined decrease of such key risk factors may help to reduce the risk of diabetes and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/a-century-of-progress-in-the-fight-against-cardiovascular-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Marette enthused. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Making a commitment to lifestyle changes and small adjustments to our everyday diets is important and can be a powerful tool in preventing future diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-maple-syrup-is-different"&gt;Why maple syrup is different&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood tests were only half the story. Stool samples showed fewer Klebsiella species and &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides pectinophilus&lt;/em&gt; – microbes tied to inflammation – after maple syrup consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, &lt;em&gt;Lactocaseibacillus casei&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Clostridium beijerinckii&lt;/em&gt; flourished. These shifts hint that maple’s natural compounds may influence metabolism partly through the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pure maple syrup brings trace nutrients along for the ride. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two tablespoons supply about 35 percent of a day’s manganese, 15 percent of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/low-carb-diets-have-more-nutritional-value-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;riboflavin&lt;/a&gt;, eight percent of copper, and small but measurable amounts of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/amaranth-seeds-rich-in-calcium-and-iron-prevents-tumors-and-keeps-bones-strong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt;, thiamin, and potassium, all while carrying roughly twelve percent fewer calories than light corn syrup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refined sugar, in contrast, arrives stripped of such extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With each new study, we learn more about the benefits that natural products from &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/many-plant-species-show-great-promise-in-fight-against-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;medicinal plants&lt;/a&gt; and functional foods, like maple syrup, provide,” noted Dr. Navindra Seeram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The promising results of this first human trial provide more reasons to educate consumers about maple syrup’s many health benefits. It is truly a ‘smarter sweetener’ and a healthier alternative to refined sugar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-maple-syrup-data-is-needed"&gt;More maple syrup data is needed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample size was modest, and the trial lasted just eight weeks. Even so, the consistency across multiple risk factors stands out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this study was limited to a relatively small sample size (42 men and women) and took place during a relatively short period, the results are still significant,” Dr. Marette remarked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now have human evidence to support replacing refined sugars with maple syrup, a natural sweetener, for preventing &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/christensenella-minuta-gut-bacteria-linked-obesity-different-men-women/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolic diseases&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists’ next goal is to conduct larger studies with other populations to explore how replacing refined sugars with maple syrup might impact their unique health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-make-the-swap"&gt;How to make the swap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swapping maple syrup for sugar in your diet is as simple as it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before the study, I would consume pure maple products regularly but not consistently,” one study participant shared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have always enjoyed it. Today my routine is to replace refined sugars with two tablespoons of pure Canadian maple syrup daily.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small swaps add up. Cutting just two tablespoons of refined sugar trims roughly 96 calories and more than 24 grams of straight sucrose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By choosing pure maple syrup in place of refined sugar, you enact a modest dietary change backed by evidence of healthier glucose responses, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-foods-might-work-like-medicines-to-lower-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, diminished visceral fat, and a more favorable gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While larger studies will refine these insights, the present trial already encourages individuals, clinicians, and food producers to rethink sweetening habits and embrace this nutrient-rich natural syrup as a wiser everyday indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone edging toward metabolic trouble, that simple switch may be one easy step toward better numbers at the next check-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jn.nutrition.org/article/S0022-3166(24)00465-6/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 22:27:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNVms4UGoxekNoY1ZuRVNjVDZBcWZWSTc1WDB2bTdxcWs4NEN6NDdMYUc0RmJKWlBieGpjeE9IUll5cTFnZTExczBhZWdUMnQwcktSRDJIQURDcnpYZnZaM1lFRjhjbFJSeXRiNUlOVDUwY19MMTBHMWFNaXRKRm8wQlFzQXNXSlp3ZTg1VllLVzlWdzhDSzBsZWJndkZPSEZG</guid></item><item><title>大脑测试可能有助于预测抗抑郁药使用者的性副作用，研究发现- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/12/health/antidepressant-sexual-dysfunction-brain-test-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Going on antidepressants can give many people their life back, but for some there is a catch.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;About &lt;a href="https://rxisk.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSM-PSSD.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;25%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-025-06751-1" target="_blank"&gt; to 80%&lt;/a&gt; of people who take antidepressants experience sexual side effects to some degree during treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgnopckt00023b6ntkodh8k9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, a tool may one day help patients both feel better and keep their sex life intact, early research suggests.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0be00063b6n38f1kri8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even though cases of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction have been&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0141076819899299#bibr3-0141076819899299" target="_blank"&gt;documented since 1960&lt;/a&gt;, there has never been a way to predict the odds of problems with libido, arousal, orgasm, erectile function or other sexual functions before someone starts taking an antidepressant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf00073b6n61jpy94j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That uncertainty eventually may change with the new use of a brain test that indirectly measures levels of the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/24795-ssri" target="_blank"&gt;critical neurotransmitter serotonin&lt;/a&gt; — which is involved in libido, arousal, mood, appetite, sleep, memory and social behavior.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgnoq70s00043b6nq8rak8jt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The novel application of the existing test is described in preliminary, first-of-its-kind research to be presented Tuesday at the 38th ECNP (European College of Neuropsychopharmacology) Congress in Amsterdam. The research is currently an abstract, so it’s still under peer review before it will be published in a journal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf00083b6n2rhy7s01@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If the findings are replicated in studies with more participants, they “could enable a more precise approach to depression treatment,” lead researcher Dr. Kristian Jensen said in a news release.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf00093b6nj720jc2d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Such testing could help doctors select medications to minimize risk of sexual side effects in patients most likely to experience them, said Jensen, a physician and postdoctoral researcher at the neurobiological research unit of Copenhagen University Hospital and Mental Health Services Centre Copenhagen.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000a3b6nyhozj78h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The noninvasive test is an electroencephalogram, or EEG, which involves &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/eeg/about/pac-20393875" target="_blank"&gt;placing small electrodes&lt;/a&gt; on the scalp to record electrical activity in the brain.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000b3b6n2wv3et8x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The test captures a specific biomarker called Loudness Dependence of Auditory Evoked Potentials, or LDAEP, which measures the brain’s electrical activity in response to sound. Auditory perception is dependent upon the brain’s serotonin levels since the neurotransmitter regulates the processing of sensory information including sound, Jensen told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000c3b6npqprgllv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The lower the LDAEP level, the greater the serotonin activity.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;After serotonin does its job in the brain, nerve cells reabsorb it. The common antidepressant escitalopram and others that are selective serotonin reuptake-inhibitors, or SSRIs, work by limiting the brain’s reuptake, making more serotonin available for use in regulating mood. Though this increase can be beneficial for mood, it’s also one of the mechanisms thought to cause antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000d3b6ncrflght2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Previous studies have suggested the LDAEP marker may be worth investigating in people with mental health conditions such as depression, bipolar disorder and anxiety, in that LDAEP levels may help predict how well a patient will respond to different psychiatric medications.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000e3b6nr6mh8w6w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers behind the latest science studied 90 participants with major depressive disorder and found lower LDAEP measures (which means higher serotonin levels) predicted orgasmic dysfunction from eight weeks of treatment with escitalopram with 87% accuracy.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000f3b6n36b7k7bt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Jensen and others are currently working on a similar study with 600 participants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000g3b6n1g9ijy21@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The measure didn’t significantly predict reduced libido but was slightly associated with the severity of antidepressant-related decreased libido. And regardless of what participants’ LDAEP measures were, they didn’t translate to differences in baseline sexual function before antidepressant treatment, further suggesting the medication caused the sexual dysfunction.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000h3b6nt43b73ws@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The precise treatment approach Jensen and his colleagues described “could help treatment adherence and overall quality of life and generally give better treatment options for depression,” he added. “We need a bigger study, with more men, to get an accurate figure for erectile dysfunction.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000i3b6nftjtvhut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The participants were unmedicated prior to treatment, age 27 on average and mostly female. To measure LDAEP, the researchers played “sounds at different volumes through headphones while measuring brain waves,” Jensen said in the news release. “It takes about 30 minutes and is non-invasive. It’s not generally available at the moment, but that may change if this test lives up to expectations.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000j3b6nj7sd6spx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Though early, the research is promising and could be quite useful, said Dr. Josef Witt-Doerring, a psychiatrist and CEO and medical director of TaperClinic, who wasn’t involved in the study. He and other clinicians help patients experiencing complex withdrawal syndromes and tapering off psychiatric drugs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000k3b6n5qwe51fg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, “there are clear caveats,” said psychiatrist Dr. Sameer Jauhar, a clinical associate professor in affective disorders and psychosis at Imperial College London, in a written statement provided by the Science Media Centre. Jauhar wasn’t involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000l3b6n2t0v7pmw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The LDAEP measure “is not a direct measure of serotonin activity,” Jauhar said. “It is not measuring it in the way we generally measure neurotransmitters in the brain, i.e. through molecular imaging, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7385290/" target="_blank"&gt;such as PET&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000m3b6ncgm0cqjl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But PET scans are invasive, costly and time-consuming, Jensen told CNN. “Nonetheless, our research unit has used PET to demonstrate that LDAEP is associated with serotonin levels,” he added. “The relationship between LDAEP and serotonin goes back several decades of human and animal research. It’s rare to find a biomarker that is both scientifically robust and practically accessible.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000n3b6n5revea4q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, the predictive accuracy requires clarification in a peer-reviewed publication, Jauhar added. “Sometimes smaller sample sizes can inflate this, and it needs validation in another dataset.” A placebo-controlled study would also be ideal, both Jauhar and Jensen said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            At least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db528.htm" target="_blank"&gt;11.4% of adults&lt;/a&gt; in the United States took antidepressants in 2023 for depression alone. Millions more take them for other mental health issues including anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, some eating disorders, substance use disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. (Information on global estimates of antidepressant use is lacking.)&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

            The science behind antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction boils down to neurotransmitters, blood flow and the muscular system, all of which are controlled by the brain, experts told CNN &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/21/health/antidepressants-sexual-side-effects-tips-wellness"&gt;in a 2024 report&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000q3b6ns77rfzzf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What’s necessary for physical arousal and orgasm is increased blood flow to the genitalia, which makes nerve endings in these organs more sensitive, Dr. Lauren Streicher, founding medical director of the Northwestern Medicine Center for Sexual Medicine and Menopause, told CNN in 2024. These factors send signals to the brain that result in the muscle contractions accompanied by orgasm.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000r3b6nnjcmnsbu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Higher levels of serotonin in the brain and other areas involved in sex can inhibit those functions, said Streicher — since SSRIs potentially restrict blood flow by binding to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, which are found in blood vessels in the skin, brain and more. The receptors control constriction and dilation in the smooth muscle fibers in the walls of these blood vessels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000s3b6nlfdw5504@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since not everyone taking these medications experiences sexual dysfunction even with higher levels of serotonin in the body, there may be underlying factors — such as genetics — making some people more prone to being negatively affected, Streicher said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000t3b6nwh7jzcrm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Of the large percentage of antidepressant takers who experience sexual side effects, there is a small percentage for whom those effects persist, or begin upon quitting the drug, for several years to decades after treatment — a condition known as post-SSRI sexual dysfunction, or PSSD. Despite its name, the condition, which has yet to be formally recognized, is often also paired with emotional, cognitive and physical dysfunction.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000u3b6n3lu17x1v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We don’t really know what this (research) means in terms of predicting people who will develop PSSD,” Witt-Doerring said, but “it makes sense that it could decrease the chance that someone gets PSSD.”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000v3b6n2jyrxt6v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The historical inability to predict antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction isn’t the result of dashed efforts, but of a general lack of scientific inquiry, Witt-Doerring said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000w3b6nplxiqvs5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was just surprised to see that someone was even looking at that,” he added. “There’s obviously a really good public health incentive to do it, but that’s not always what really motivates people.” &lt;s&gt; &lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000x3b6nu9o0muex@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings of the latest research “should encourage people to study this important side effect in more detail,” Jauhar said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf000y3b6nq3a54yfv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With the prevalence of antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction and patients who &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35918097/" target="_blank"&gt;don’t respond well&lt;/a&gt; or at all to antidepressants, the latest science adds to a body of research that may advance the development of methods for predicting both effectiveness and harms of different drugs for the individual, Witt-Doerring said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            To avoid antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction, many people opt for or switch to bupropion, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, or NDRI, Dr. Jonathan Alpert, the Dorothy and Marty Silverman Chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/21/health/antidepressants-sexual-side-effects-tips-wellness"&gt;told CNN in 2024&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of increasing serotonin, bupropion ups the amount of ﻿the neurotransmitter&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;dopamine, which supports sexual desire and response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf00103b6n0g5mpl4i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you’re already on an antidepressant causing sexual problems, work with your prescribing clinician to troubleshoot the issue and avoid potentially exacerbating it, Streicher said. They might wait and see if your body adjusts within a few months, but many people switch medications if they don’t want to wait or if side effects don’t alleviate, Alpert said.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgn7e0bf00113b6nx0ld66re@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other times, to better manage or alleviate dysfunction, doctors may add another medication to a patient’s current routine. Medications for general sexual dysfunction, such as sildenafil or phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, are sometimes prescribed to promote better blood flow and muscle relaxation in genital areas, counteracting the blood vessel constriction caused by high levels of serotonin, experts said.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
