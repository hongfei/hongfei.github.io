&lt;p&gt;In case you’ve been living under a rock and missed the hype, Ozempic is an injectable diabetes drug that’s become popular as an off-label medication for weight loss. It mimics GLP-1, a naturally occurring hormone, to suppress appetite and delay the passage of food in the stomach, making many feel fuller after eating less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if I wanted to, I couldn’t take drugs like Ozempic because I have a stomach condition called gastroparesis, also known as paralysis of the stomach. Recently, media outlets have reported that in rare instances, taking &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/25/health/weight-loss-diabetes-drugs-gastroparesis/index.html" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7941202" data-affiliate="true"&gt;these drugs might be linked&lt;/a&gt; to the development of gastroparesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re related to me, you’ve probably never heard of the condition, but gastroparesis is thought to affect about &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/gastroparesis/definition-facts#:~:text=symptoms%20and%20complications.-,How%20common%20is%20gastroparesis%3F,the%20United%20States2%2C%203." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7941202" data-affiliate="true"&gt;10 men and 40 women&lt;/a&gt; out of 100,000 people. In addition to nausea and vomiting, the condition also causes gas, acid reflux, distension and other equally fun symptoms. As my gastroenterologist explained it to me, the muscles in the stomach react too slowly in people with gastroparesis, causing food to sit there until it starts to ferment. The resulting symptoms, particularly the severe nausea and vomiting, mean that eating will be the last thing on your mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no matter how much weight you may lose, you do not want gastroparesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My condition is officially listed as idiopathic — that is, it has no known cause. In the spring of 2015, I started to feel nauseous all the time. After months of morning sickness-like nausea and vomiting, followed by a misdiagnosis and an unnecessary surgery to remove my gallbladder, my gastroenterologist mentioned an unusual medical condition that could only be diagnosed with a special test at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the radioisotope gastric-emptying test, I had to ingest egg salad containing a small amount of tasteless radioactive material that allowed a mini camera to follow the food through my digestive system. Scans of my stomach were then taken over several hours. Afterward, it was official: I was diagnosed with gastroparesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason why you don’t want gastroparesis? There is no cure. Ondansetron, the drug of choice for the nausea, does nothing for me. The preferred drug for delayed stomach emptying, domperidone, was available in the U.S. when I first developed the condition but I now have to get it from Canada. And the cost of domperidone, about $1,000 annually, is not picked up by insurance. I also have to take pantoprazole and sucralfate, twice a day each, to prevent painful acid reflux and ulcers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are surgical treatments like one I had last year at a gastroparesis clinic in Ohio to help manage symptoms, but again, they are not a cure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though some cases of gastroparesis do go away on their own, the longer you’ve had the condition, the greater the likelihood that it won’t. Gastroparesis is not life-threatening, but it has definitely been life-altering for me, as any chronic medical condition can be. It literally affects every aspect of my life; I never know when I will wake up feeling nauseous, so having to cancel plans is an unfortunate side effect of gastroparesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way for me to manage the condition is by being hypervigilant about what I eat and drastically limiting fiber and fats. No meat, no more fresh veggies or most fruits, no lettuce, and no oil or fried foods that slow down digestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I eat lots of small, bland meals and I am constantly monitoring my symptoms. If I don’t eat enough, I get nauseous. If I eat too much, I get nauseous. If I eat something that actually tastes good, I will probably get nauseous. I am afraid to try a dish when when I don’t know exactly what’s in it, since accidentally eating a food that’s isn’t “safe” can lead to extreme nausea that has me curled up in the fetal position for days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I often bring my own food when I travel, even for a day, and I am always thinking ahead about my meal options. I always carry my meds, as well as snacks that don’t require refrigeration, like oyster crackers, saltines and mints. Big events like weddings can be particularly challenging; I’ve had to sneak away to eat my yogurt or plain turkey wrap, which I bring in an insulated lunch bag. I carry a plastic bowl in my car, just like I did when I was pregnant, in case I have to vomit. In short, I am never not thinking about gastroparesis or worrying about its potential symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A panel of vaccine advisers to the federal government debated several changes to COVID-19 vaccine access in a chaotic meeting Friday, marked by confusion over processes, technical difficulties and passionate disagreement among members and other experts in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the committee backed away from its most controversial proposal that called for states to require those who want a COVID-19 vaccine to get a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The committee voted to recommend vaccination for adults 65 and older and younger people subject to a process called shared decision making. Their recommendations would not prohibit anyone over six months from getting the shot, but they do call for patients to speak with a clinician about the risks and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For people 64 and younger the conversation should emphasize that benefits are greatest for people with the most risk of serious disease and lowest for people without increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The advisers also voted that the CDC should add information about the possible risks and uncertainties related to COVID vaccine effectiveness to information sheets about the shots. Many of the risks were speculative or already known to be unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the CDC generally adopts the recommendations of the panel, the votes are not final until acting CDC director Jim O'Neill signs off on them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The gathering underscored the turbulent and highly politicized nature of vaccine policy under the leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which is now at odds with positions held by major medical organizations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the course of the meeting, many clinicians in attendance raised concerns about how ACIP had sidelined expert input, elevated questionable or preliminary data, and broken from the established process for developing these recommendations, which influence insurance coverage.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's troubling to see the erosion of the committee's integrity," said Dr. Sandra Fryhofer, who spoke on behalf of the American Medical Association on Friday, "We're concerned about how vaccine recommendations are being developed by this new panel, data is being selectively used to justify specific conclusions&lt;em&gt;." &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The recommendations on COVID-19 come on the heels of Thursday's vote to restrict access to the MMRV vaccine in children under 4, and represent the latest push in Kennedy's ongoing campaign to reshape vaccine policy in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, some proposals that would have more dramatically reshaped the vaccine schedule did not make it through. A vote to remove the recommendations that infants get the hepatitis B vaccine at birth failed to pass on Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And the recommendation that a prescription be required for anyone to get a COVID vaccine – which could have been a new hurdle in many places, if states adopted the recommendation – ended in a tie. ACIP chairman Martin Kulldorff voted no, breaking the tie. The motion failed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This was the second meeting of the vaccine panel since Kennedy fired &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5428533/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisory-committee-acip" target="_blank"&gt;the existing roster&lt;/a&gt;, chosen during the Biden administration, and installed his own choices. Some on the panel have a history of criticizing vaccines, particularly the COVID-19 shots which have been an animating force for many of Kennedy's supporters.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One member, Retsef Levi, an MIT professor of operations management, drove much of the discussion leading up the votes on COVID-19, which were not shared publicly until Levi presented them at the end of the meeting. Several outside medical groups in attendance requested that the voting topics be shared to have transparency.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In his comments, Levi emphasized safety concerns about the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I don't think that the public currently believes the narrative of safe and effective," he told the panel.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There has been considerable confusion around the availability of COVID-19 shots since late August when the Food and Drug Administration only &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5515503/fda-covid-vaccines-restricted" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;approved&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the fall boosters for people who are 65 and up, or have high risk medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;You may have heard lately that tattoos can potentially raise your risk of skin cancer. Recent research might complicate that narrative, however, suggesting that tattoos aren’t as harmful to our skin as assumed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of Utah led the study, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jnci/djaf235/8239343?login=false"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last month in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Contrary to their expectations, they found that people who had multiple tattoos actually had a lower associated risk of melanoma. That said, the findings don’t provide conclusive proof that tattoos can prevent skin cancer, the researchers caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Further investigation is warranted to clarify these relationships,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;An unexpected finding&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several recent studies have indicated that tattoos could pose a unique cancer risk. Just this March, for instance, a study of twins living in Denmark &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/tattoos-could-be-a-hidden-cancer-risk-study-of-twins-finds-2000578684"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that people with a tattoo had greater odds of being diagnosed with skin cancer (and lymphoma) than their non-inked siblings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tattoo ink can contain &lt;a href="https://tattoo.iarc.who.int/background/"&gt;potential carcinogens&lt;/a&gt;, such as certain metals, and some researchers have speculated that the ink can agitate our body’s cells in harmful ways, causing inflammation or other changes that fuel cancer formation. By that logic, people with large or multiple tattoos should have a greater risk of skin cancer. And indeed, the Danish study did find that people with a larger tattoo had a higher risk than others.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the help of cancer registry data, the researchers behind the new study attempted to survey as many Utah residents as possible who had been diagnosed with melanoma between January 2020 and June 2021, conducting the surveys by phone. All told, they obtained responses from 1,167 melanoma cases. They then compared these cases to controls matched in age, ethnicity, and other factors (this data was collected from a representative survey of Utah residents regularly conducted by the state health department).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As with the earlier Danish study, the researchers expected that the more tattoos someone had, the greater their odds of having skin cancer would be. But to their great surprise, they found otherwise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with two or more tattoos had a lower associated risk of both invasive and localized (also called &lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt;) melanoma, the results showed. The most apparent lower risk was seen in people who had four or more tattoos and in people with three or more large tattoos.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;What to think about your tattoos&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers certainly aren’t ready to declare that tattoos will keep people safe from skin cancer just yet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In their paper, they argue the lower observed risk in people with multiple tattoos is likely a sign of “unmeasured confounding”—meaning they might have failed to control for other important risk factors that could differ between people who get tattooed a lot compared to people who don’t. People who get multiple tattoos may be more vigilant about their skin care in general, for instance, and opt to wear sunscreen or stay out of the sun more often.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers also point out that they still observed a small increased risk of skin cancer associated with only having one tattoo, further muddying the implications of their work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“This isn’t a black and white case of ‘get more tattoos, and you could lower your risk of melanoma,’” said lead study author &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1 s3"&gt;Rachel McCarty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;, a former doctoral student at the University of Utah’s Huntsman Cancer Institute, in a &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/huntsmancancerinstitute/press-releases/2025/09/study-finds-melanoma-less-common-individuals-several-tattoos"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the institute. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“Instead, we need to do more research to understand what we are seeing and if this decreased risk is simply due to behavioral or physical factors, or if there could be beneficial immune responses associated with tattooing which lower melanoma risk.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting at least one other recent study &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-abstract/29/10/2093/124436/Tattoos-and-Hematologic-Malignancies-in-British?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt; to find a link between potentially relevant cancers like lymphoma and tattooing. So at least for the time being, the jury is still out on whether people should be concerned about their tattoos and to what extent.&lt;/p&gt;

Most of those cases – 85% – involved wounds being exposed to seawater, and 92% of the infected had one underlying health condition, the health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Over the previous decade, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/louisiana" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; has registered an average of 10 Vibrio infections and a single death, state health department officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The higher numbers in Louisiana come after scientific researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-28247-2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; of evidence that Vibrio infections are becoming more common amid rising sea surface temperatures associated with the climate crisis – which has primarily been spurred by human emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vibrio bacteria flourish in warm coastal waters and proliferate between May and October. Infections can result from exposing an open wound to seawater or from consuming seafood that is either raw or undercooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;About one in five people who contract Vibrio vulnificus in particular die – occasionally within two days of feeling sick from the infection. Those who do survive such an infection on occasion require limb amputation or intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The story of one man who grew up in New Orleans, and died after contracting Vibrio vulnificus in July in nearby Bay St Louis, Mississippi, vividly illustrated the dangers of the bacterium to the public in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Basil Kennedy, 77, evidently contracted the bacterium after scraping his leg on a boat trailer, his daughter told the Louisiana news station &lt;a href="https://www.fox8live.com/2025/08/12/mississippi-man-with-new-orleans-ties-dead-flesh-eating-bacteria/?fbclid=IwY2xjawMIJmBleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFiWHRIU0s4a3JKSzlEVnF4AR4JF8LK9Y54BiehiI1D2POkhtUW-W1YaB6A7tX7tTSHMpz-UqfKNzquUUcBFA_aem_Jlk9wK-fDHfZz4cxZ-24MA" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;WVUE&lt;/a&gt;. Kennedy reportedly cleaned and bandaged the wound, and he avoided getting into the water, thinking nothing more of it. But in about three days, his health sharply declined, and he died, his daughter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kay Kennedy Regimbal told the station “there doesn’t need to be fear of the water” despite her father’s death – but she added that “there really needs to be an education and an understanding of how to be prepared for a situation where you may be exposed or there is a potential risk”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Symptoms of Vibrio infection can include gastrointestinal illness, an unusually severe wound or – as associated with bloodstream infection – fever, blistering and dangerously low blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The US usually reports about 150 to 200 cases of Vibrio vulnificus a year. About half of those cases occur in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Louisiana officials said the most cases and deaths have been in their state and Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 18:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOOGJoRUk3N0lPam9lUDV4NXdUWEduN0F4ODVuMVc4dGhoak9qeW9Yb1JxN0tjUjBIS2VsLTB2eGZESkJuZUpCUjk0VE1IcVJNWGRFdFNoV3B4SEw2UWhHQTNqSG9haVI3WVViV2RwbERmemF5Tm8yX0VrbkREYzIxOW1BTlhJaWVtVkxhYVRVOA</guid></item><item><title>密歇根州的顶级文档提供新冠肺炎疫苗资格说明- MLive.com</title><link>https://www.mlive.com/news/2025/09/michigans-top-doc-offers-covid-19-vaccine-eligibility-clarification.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GXOI6EIDS5BT3KYL6SAIX2KI2A"&gt;Michigan’s chief medical executive has issued guidance to clear up confusion for vaccine providers and residents alike regarding this year’s COVID-19 booster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="M4NZWKAIHVH7VLA4X6RGZH5F5Y"&gt;Anyone older than 6 months and without contraindication, who has not yet received the 2025-2026 vaccine, can be considered to have an underlying condition that makes them eligible to be vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4UH2R5A3J5HB3NGXTRDDAFL76I"&gt;Not being vaccinated in and of itself is an underlying condition, explained Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, citing studies that found last year’s booster reduced risk of severe illness leading to emergency room visits by 33% and hospitalization risk by 45%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QWRZQJBCZVH43OWFBPCW4ZSIW4"&gt;“National medical organizations and scientific experts continue to recommend routine COVID-19 vaccination for those at high risk, but also recommend vaccines be made available for all those who want them, ages six months and older,” Bagdasarian said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VDCNOUFZ2VHR7AKXIL6HQALKMI"&gt;“As the state’s chief medical executive, it is my duty to protect and promote public health, and everyone deserves the opportunity to access COVID-19 vaccine if they desire one.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="H64CD5XN4RBXZOUMNW2WCZFFQU"&gt;Bagdasarian issued a “&lt;a href="https://links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.michigan.gov%2Fmdhhs%2F-%2Fmedia%2FProject%2FWebsites%2Fmdhhs%2FCME-Standing-Recommendation-Regarding-2025-COVID-19-Vaccines-FINAL-436pm_09182025.pdf%3Futm_campaign=%26utm_medium=email%26utm_source=govdelivery/1/0100019962494de1-47cbff9c-7d68-4ef1-96f2-f947163035e4-000000/mLX4bn_G0H3VQAxu2OE4ZINzsfAerHgwn9hFw9a5PnY=423" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flinks-1.govdelivery.com%2FCL0%2Fhttps%3A%252F%252Fwww.michigan.gov%252Fmdhhs%252F-%252Fmedia%252FProject%252FWebsites%252Fmdhhs%252FCME-Standing-Recommendation-Regarding-2025-COVID-19-Vaccines-FINAL-436pm_09182025.pdf%253Futm_campaign%3D%2526utm_medium%3Demail%2526utm_source%3Dgovdelivery%2F1%2F0100019962494de1-47cbff9c-7d68-4ef1-96f2-f947163035e4-000000%2FmLX4bn_G0H3VQAxu2OE4ZINzsfAerHgwn9hFw9a5PnY%3D423&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjhicks3%40mlive.com%7C42522d753d4c45f3731108ddf78547de%7C1fe6294574e64203848fb9b82929f9d4%7C0%7C0%7C638938874327223509%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=VfgYs%2Fnl4aw1jfyHz%2Bqt6im%2BvquOOP44Zh6VoUc71M8%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0"&gt;standing recommendation&lt;/a&gt;” on the vaccine Friday, Sept. 19.

Legionella can survive in airborne water droplets for several hours, although this timespan is highly dependent on factors such as relative humidity and the specific bacterial strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease causes &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-7a9abbe0-9562-11f0-93eb-5da462fdacf7"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, a severe lung infection that often begins with a high fever that can rocket past 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius). A relentless, dry cough and profound shortness of breath quickly follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The illness wages a full-body attack, bringing muscle aches, headache and a confused mental state as well as severe gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. In some of the most severe cases, the infection can even lead to coughing up blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sydney Grewell, the county's health department director, said the scale of the outbreak is unlike anything the community or the state has experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The recent outbreaks mirror a major incident in Manhattan, where tainted cooling towers sickened 114 people and resulted in seven fatalities throughout Harlem and Morningside Heights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this month, it was announced that a deadly outbreak of Legionnaires' disease, which first tore through New York City neighborhoods, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14954791/Legionnaires-disease-death-Michigan-cases.html"&gt;has now spread&lt;/a&gt; to the city's northern suburbs, claiming new lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials in Westchester County announced two fatalities, one in White Plains and another in New Rochelle, and confirmed 35 additional cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The outbreak echoes a recent crisis in Manhattan, where 114 people were sickened across Harlem and Morningside Heights, leading to seven deaths traced to contaminated cooling towers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the source of the Westchester cluster remains under investigation, Health Commissioner Dr Sherlita Amler pointed to the summer's prolonged stretch of 90-degree days as a key factor, creating the warm, stagnant water conditions in which the lethal Legionella bacteria thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, in Michigan, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14954791/Legionnaires-disease-death-Michigan-cases.html"&gt;a deadly outbreak&lt;/a&gt; of Legionnaires' disease at a retirement community claimed the lives of two residents this summer, prompting an urgent investigation by health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The deceased, both residents of Allegria Village in Dearborn, contracted bacterial pneumonia in June and July. While their identities have not been released, officials confirmed they had recently moved into separate units within the continuing care facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Wayne County Health, Human and Veterans Services department is leading the investigation, which is still in its early stages, to determine the source of the contamination and ensure the safety of other residents and staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Up to 18,000 people are hospitalized with Legionnaires’ disease each year in the US, and about one in 10 die. It’s more common between June and October, in part because air conditioners run more than any other time of year and cooling towers are typically the cause of outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The number of Legionnaires' disease cases in Marshall County, Iowa, has surged to 68, doubling the total in just over a week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Despite launching an investigation, health officials in Iowa have not yet identified the source of the outbreak in the county, which has a population of approximately 40,000 people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Legionella bacteria thrive in warm water. Summer weather creates ideal conditions for it to multiply to dangerous levels in human-made water systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iowa health officials have not said how many of the 68 patients in that state have been hospitalized. In Marshall County, one death has been recorded: Father Bernard ‘Bernie’ Charles Grady, 82.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The retired Catholic priest, described by his brother Peter as a ‘remarkable’ and ‘incredible’ man, became the outbreak's first and, so far, only fatality according to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.siouxlandproud.com/news/iowa-news/legionnaires-cases-in-iowa-community-grow-as-one-family-grieves/"&gt;SiouxLand Proud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specialized testing confirmed he had been infected by the bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His illness began suddenly with dizziness during dinner on August 22nd. A week later, after suffering from congestive heart failure, he passed away in a Waterloo hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The extremely high fevers associated with Legionnaires' disease drastically increase the body's metabolic rate. This means the heart has to work much harder and faster to deliver oxygen and nutrients to fight the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infections are more likely to be severe in seniors, who have weaker immune systems than younger populations.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases, the bacterial infection can spread to the bloodstream, leading to sepsis, which in turn can cause a dramatic drop in blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;in Michigan, a deadly outbreak of Legionnaires' disease at a retirement community has claimed the lives of two residents this summer, prompting an urgent investigation by health officials&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To compensate, the heart must pump even more vigorously, which can overwhelm a heart that is already weakened or has pre-existing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, an estimated 250 to 800 people die from Legionnaires' disease each year, based on reported case data, which represents only a fraction of actual cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The symptoms of Legionnaires' disease are indistinguishable from those of many other types of pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without a specific reason to suspect Legionella, a doctor will often diagnose and treat it as community-acquired pneumonia, without ever identifying the exact cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health department director Grewell said: ‘This is something I’ve never experienced. I don’t think this is something that Marshall County has experienced, and I don’t think this is something the state has experienced as well, especially of this magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We have seen some trends in the patients that we are seeing, which is why we narrowed the focus to northcentral Marshalltown. Those people have visited the area, traveled to the area, and that’s where our cooling towers are primarily located.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 18:31:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOd1FDbHZ5T2d0azFNamJBRkkzZVBOYVhnRjlzby1nYWd3UldRR0pxWlVIRTFpMXpPUXU0VHRNQUFqSDVOZnB6M3p0OEl0c05PbzdaVWxZaktXdmVZdVFETVpOanRpOXUyRl8wRXBLYXBhU3FsQnkzTVczOGJsOGF1dGt5clpEOTB6X0NwbVBoUzRpNm9IZzRWVDh3Rll6a0pEWXBpRkNNUdIBrAFBVV95cUxNWGp6OWxyRmNwWjZLRng5aHBMQjB5YzBYLWhDOVk4LXR5czlVdHVnTndOdDRVU3dHUHJMYTRMS1ducUxVV3VfRjdzRmhyRGw3d09jMHI0bHF0N3hCdmlYT3ZEa2RER3FmdTRrMTdTMXJ0dGxVWkRqbE41R2hTajBnZ1U4RmRtQkdnbVZzUUR1TTZlX1hwQmwzRHV6S0tGaVhscEt6azF1WTg2ZURU</guid></item><item><title>每年对数百万人进行的“过度使用”医学检查使癌症风险增加三倍-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15115371/overused-medical-test-triples-children-cancer-risk-ct-scan.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiation exposure from 'overused' medical scans may triple the risk of cancer in children, a government-funded study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every year, about 18 percent of Americans, 61million, undergo imaging tests like CT scans, which use radiation to create detailed pictures from inside the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the tests are crucial for detecting injuries, chronic diseases and cancer, repeated scans can cause &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14482065/Over-used-medical-test-given-millions-year-causing-explosion-tumors.html"&gt;small amounts of radiation&lt;/a&gt;, a known carcinogen, to accumulate in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With these risks in mind, researchers in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-250d97a0-9577-11f0-a15e-b9099f259218"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; examined data from nearly four million children in the US and Canada to examine radiation's effect on cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found about one in 10, adding up to 3,000, cases of blood cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma in children could be attributed to radiation exposure from tests like CT scans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, getting just one or two head CT scans was linked to nearly twice the risk of developing cancer. But as children got more scans over time, they were over three times more likely to be diagnosed than children who didn't have the tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers suggest about one in 10 blood cancers in children and teens could be prevented entirely by cutting out unnecessary imaging tests and lowering radiation doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using other methods like ultrasound or MRI, they said, could provide a feasible alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A new study from researchers in California found regular scans using radiation could increase a child's risk of cancer by 3.5 times (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rebecca Smith-Bindman, first study author and radiologist at the University of California San Francisco, said: 'Children are particularly vulnerable to radiation-induced cancer due to their heightened radiosensitivity and longer life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While medical imaging can be lifesaving, our findings underscore the critical need to carefully evaluate and minimize radiation exposure during pediatric imaging to safeguard children’s long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This involves ensuring that imaging is performed only when it provides essential information for the child’s care and, in cases such as CT scans, using the lowest possible radiation doses.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 15,000 children in the US are diagnosed with cancer every year, with the most common form being leukemia, accounting for around 30 percent of US diagnoses per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly 1,600 American children die of cancer each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent research also shows childhood cancers have &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14267083/doctors-warning-toxic-chemicals-cause-childhood-cancers.html"&gt;increased by about 35 percent&lt;/a&gt; over the last half-century, which experts have suggested could be due not only to better diagnostic tools but also increased environmental exposures like radiation and pollution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published Wednesday in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2502098"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, followed a cohort of 3.7million children born between 1996 and 2016 across six US healthcare systems and Ontario, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/canada/index.html" id="mol-151c01a0-9573-11f0-a15e-b9099f259218"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants were followed from birth until they either: were diagnosed with &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-151990a0-9573-11f0-a15e-b9099f259218"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; or a benign tumor, ended healthcare coverage, turned 21 or until the study's end date of December 31, 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the relative risks for blood cancers in children according to cumulative radiation exposure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Half of the participants were male, and the largest group (43 percent) were born between 1996 and 2004, and 4,916 (0.1 percent) died before the end of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the participants, 2,961 were diagnosed with blood cancer during the study period. Eight in 10 cases were lymphoma, while leukemia and bone marrow cancer accounted for 15.5 percent. The remainder were rare cancers of the white blood and immune cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 58 percent of cancer patients were males, and just over half the cancers were diagnosed in children under five years old.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found for children who underwent a head CT, about 25 percent of their cancers could be attributed to radiation exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, getting one or two CT scans of the head was associated with a 1.8-fold increased risk of blood cancer, and receiving repeated scans increased the risk 3.5 times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'In our cohort of children and adolescents, we estimated that medical imaging was associated with 10.1 percent of hematologic cancers.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk comes from the unregulated radiation exposure that varies widely machine-to-machine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CT scans can be life-saving tests, catching disease or bleeding early enough to be treated. They also used to diagnose and monitor diseases like cancer and bone injuries, as well as to assist in surgeries and evaluate efficacy of certain treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, experts say they are sometimes overprescribed and performed unnecessarily, potentially because of the money-making opportunities for the hospitals, as the tests are very expensive, or out of doctors' fears of missing a diagnosis and being sued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the risk of blood cancers after exposure to radiation &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiation is a known carcinogen found to damage the DNA molecules within cells, causing them to multiple out of control and form cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also generates free radicals, toxic molecules that attack DNA and other compounds within cells, and induces inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiation from tests like CT scans is easily absorbed by the bones, where it travels to bone marrow and increases the risk of blood and bone marrow cancers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers urgently urged clinicians to only use scans with radiations when necessary instead for an MRI or ultrasound, neither of which use radiation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Diana Miglioretti, study author and professor at UC Davis Health and chief of the Division of Biostatistics, said: 'This study provides robust, directly observed evidence of a clear dose-response relationship between radiation from medical imaging and hematologic malignancy risk in children and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings align with international research highlighting that children are especially radiosensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It’s crucial for clinicians to weigh the immediate benefits of imaging against potential long-term health risks and to optimize imaging protocols to minimize radiation exposure.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research was funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and grants from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research from Dr Smith-Bindman estimated that more than 100,000 new cancers will have been caused by CT scans from exams done in 2023 alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research, published in April, estimated 'CT-associated cancer could eventually account for five percent of all new cancer diagnoses annually.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 18:22:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，这种夜间习惯可能会增加您的痴呆风险- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/dementia-risk-habit-study-11813296</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt; links chronic insomnia with a 40% higher risk of later cognitive impairment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with insomnia who also slept less than usual, were more likely to have markers tied to memory problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Starting a nightly routine and advice from a health care professional can help with quality sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sleepless nights aren’t just exhausting—they may carry implications for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/worst-habits-for-brain-health-11773249" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;long-term brain health&lt;/a&gt;. While many of us experience occasional rough patches, chronic insomnia has been increasingly connected to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/everyday-habits-hurting-your-memory-11804198" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;memory and thinking changes&lt;/a&gt; as we age. Now, new research published in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, adds weight to that concern: older adults with chronic insomnia had a 40% higher risk of developing cognitive impairment (a category that includes MCI and dementia) during follow-up.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What’s especially notable is that the investigators also looked inside the brain. Among people with insomnia who reported sleeping less than usual, imaging at baseline revealed more white matter changes (often a sign of small blood-vessel stress in the brain) and higher amyloid burden (a protein that can accumulate in Alzheimer’s disease). Together, the clinical and imaging findings help explain why &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-sleep-insomnia-risk-new-study-8628457" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;persistent sleep problems&lt;/a&gt; might track with later cognitive issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers drew on data from the long-running Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, which follows older adults over time. They compared participants with and without chronic insomnia and tracked annual cognitive testing alongside brain imaging. Cognitive outcomes included global cognitive scores and diagnostic status (normal, MCI or dementia). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Imaging focused on white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI. White matter hyperintensities are bright spots linked with small-vessel changes. The imaging also included amyloid-PET, which visualizes amyloid accumulation. The team used established statistical models to estimate both the risk of developing cognitive impairment and how cognition and imaging markers changed over time, while adjusting for many health and lifestyle factors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In this study, chronic insomnia was linked to a 40% higher risk of developing cognitive impairment over the study period. Second, among those with insomnia who also slept less than their usual amount, baseline testing and scans painted a less favorable brain-health picture—poorer cognitive performance, more WMH and higher amyloid at the outset. Importantly, insomnia was not tied to faster accumulation of WMH or amyloid across follow-up. In plain terms: having insomnia, particularly with less sleep, was linked to greater risk. It wasn’t linked to a faster pace of brain damage later on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To help interpret the magnitude, the authors note this elevated risk is meaningful—large enough to deserve attention—yet still observational. The study cannot prove that treating insomnia would prevent cognitive impairment; other factors may contribute despite careful adjustments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study has some notable limitations. Insomnia was identified from medical records rather than overnight sleep studies. Changes in sleep duration were self-reported and not always measured at the same time as the insomnia diagnosis. And because participants are from a single region, the results might not be generalizable to everyone.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re wrestling with ongoing sleep trouble, there’s a lot you can do, starting tonight. Anchor a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/i-tried-a-doctor-recommended-sleep-routine-for-2-weeks-8763725" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;consistent wake-up time&lt;/a&gt; every day (weekends included) to steady your body clock. Build a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-women-over-50-should-do-before-bed-11757559" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;wind-down routine&lt;/a&gt; 30 to 60 minutes before bed: dim the lights, step away from email and doomscrolling and switch to quiet, low-stimulation activities. Get bright outdoor light soon after waking and keep evening light low to reinforce your natural rhythm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protect your sleep by reserving the bed for sleep and sex. If you're awake and frustrated for about 20 minutes, get up and do something calm in dim light until you feel sleepy again. Cut off caffeine by early afternoon, and avoid alcohol for three to four hours before bed. Daily movement, like walking, helps build healthy sleep pressure and brief stress-management practices (slow breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, a short mindfulness session) can reduce nighttime arousal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For chronic insomnia, ask a health care provider about cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. If you snore, wake up gasping or feel excessively sleepy in the day, consider getting screened for obstructive sleep apnea. Talk to a health care professional if your sleep problems persist for three months or more, if you routinely sleep less than six or seven hours despite your best efforts or if sleepiness makes driving unsafe.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A large study in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt; reports that chronic insomnia is associated with a 40% higher risk of developing cognitive impairment, and that people with insomnia who also slept less than usual showed more white matter changes and higher amyloid at baseline.

One member also said the voting language wasn’t clear and could lead to confusing guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0e1c88" class="body-graf"&gt;The unorthodox decision follows a chaotic, unconventional voting process for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), whose 12 members were all appointed under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the last few months. Many have expressed skepticism about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-db5bab" class="body-graf"&gt;The members were due to vote Friday on whether to delay the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine until a child is at least 1 month old, provided the mother tests negative for the virus. Currently, the first dose is given within 24 hours of birth because hepatitis B — an incurable infection that can lead to liver disease, cancer and death — can be transmitted from mother to child during delivery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-258047" class="body-graf"&gt;The hepatitis B vaccine has become a target of Republican legislators, including Rand Paul of Kentucky, who question the medical necessity of protecting newborns if their mothers have tested negative for the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bccfe3" class="body-graf"&gt;ACIP member Dr. Robert Malone said Thursday that the committee took up the subject because “a significant population” in the U.S. has concerns about vaccine policy, including giving the hepatitis B vaccine at birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5d513e" class="body-graf"&gt;However, many public health experts questioned the need for a vote without new data to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-27e0cd" class="body-graf"&gt;Minutes before tabling the subject, the ACIP voted unanimously to recommend testing all pregnant women for hepatitis B. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said the test is covered across insurance programs and the goal of the vote was to encourage providers and health systems to increase testing rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-776e8d" class="body-graf"&gt;At the meeting on Thursday, CDC staffers &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/02-langer-hep-b-508.pdf__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!oU4Q9e_38wyod3qsCKl_7D82SjN7OstS2ldBmu3EqyV-o31SM2XBkZiE0YK48MAU2QrYje_19WDXlAWPDKUJwPrXjHrd$" target="_blank"&gt;summarized the results of 17 studies&lt;/a&gt;, which found that the hepatitis B vaccine is overwhelmingly safe and has helped to virtually eliminate hepatitis B infections among newborns. The agency also noted that many pregnant women aren’t screened for hepatitis B in the U.S., making it hard to rely on testing to decide which children to vaccinate. According to the CDC, 12-16% of pregnant women in the U.S. are never tested for hepatitis B during pregnancy — and even if they are, some cases can be missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3cafe7" class="body-graf"&gt;Several ACIP members pushed back on what they said were omissions in the CDC’s presentations, pointing to individual studies and anecdotes that they said raised questions about neuro-developmental side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e064ba" class="body-graf"&gt;Two committee members, Malone and Vicky Pebsworth — both of whom have a history of sharing misinformation about vaccines — said the CDC presentations omitted a &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/13164/chapter/10" target="_blank"&gt;2012 report from the Institute of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. The report said it couldn’t determine whether hepatitis B vaccines were associated with brain inflammation because no studies had properly looked at that research question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c60234" class="body-graf"&gt;“The absence of data that statistically proves lack of safety does not mean that the product is safe,” Malone said on Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7afc72" class="body-graf"&gt;Pebsworth also raised concerns about CDC data showing irritability or fussiness in some infants who received the hepatitis B vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f59d79" class="body-graf"&gt;“These are not trivial reactions,” Pebsworth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cd9b05" class="body-graf"&gt;However, such symptoms are hard to attribute to vaccines because infants can be irritable or fussy regardless of vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f1ec3e" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrician and the only current ACIP member who has previously served on the committee, pushed back on Pebsworth’s concern, noting that irritability or restlessness “are certainly not objective parameters that should be used to assess safety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f81574" class="body-graf"&gt;He added that no vaccine is 100% safe or effective, but that the committee was meant to decide whether protection from vaccines outweighs any possible risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a2cb0b" class="body-graf"&gt;“When you apply that to a newborn hepatitis B vaccine, I don’t think there’s any question whatsoever that the benefit far outweighs any adverse side effect,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4e4e0a" class="body-graf"&gt;Cases of acute hepatitis B infections among children plummeted after the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5730a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;began recommending a universal dose&lt;/a&gt; at birth in 1991. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-896a09" class="body-graf"&gt;It's unclear whether ACIP will revisit the subject in the future. If they do, liaisons from the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, the American College of Physicians and the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine called on the committee to return to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/media/pdfs/2024/09/ACIP-Evidence-to-Recommendations-Framework-cdc.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;a framework for vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt; that has long guided the advisory panel's decisions. The framework considers a vaccine's risk and benefits, whether a recommendation is feasible and how it would impact health equity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3bbc2a" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Amy Middleman, a liaison for the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine, said it's easy to be distracted by conflicting studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-86845c" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I would urge the committee to use the methodical, scientific method to weigh the risks and benefits appropriately,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 17:06:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQN2J1QU1MSGIzX0o2TWRjQWFFcnBETE9FQ2k0ZmZsWHppeFhPM1J4OUdPTTRBV3YtcWh4akxfNThpM2J2Z3RSZG84a0M5RHRBRzl2Wl9feFByX2M2djhZZUQ1cnRqelhFYjJLNEpGNkRqX1Nzd0lDSm5QMjlfSHFUd2RrYmVQMVljNVhOSjZWdHVYU05RZmVQX0FOcUXSAVZBVV95cUxQNnpaeGFKeFhxLW5aNjd1Q3JHUnA4V0hoM1RFeEU5NTE0dm95dEV4UVJVdUk5QVRDUTRTWHpwYlhDWXRwX05EQzk0Njlsc3Z3Q0QtOEZpZw</guid></item><item><title>观看直播：疾控中心咨询小组讨论COVID-19疫苗风险，与外部专家就流程进行争论- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-covid-19-hepatitis-b-vaccines/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-update__bodytext"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;After the tabled hep B vote, some liaison members from top medical organizations shared their agreement for holding off on making changes to the current recommendations. Some also urged more transparency in how decisions will be made on future potential recommendation changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would urge the committee to use the methodical scientific method to weigh the risks and benefits appropriately," said Dr. Amy Middleman, a liaison for the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. She added, "This is important for all vaccine decisions, and this is what I think some of us are really concerned about in terms of the absence of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP member Retsef Levi said he appreciated the desire to keep scientific methods but took issue with the liaison member's comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have to say that one thing that puzzles me is that many of the speakers that push for the scientific approach are speaking very confidently in the absence of the gold standard evidence of robust long-term clinical trials against placebo," Levi added, who has been pushing for more research beyond what the CDC has presented during the meetings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When ACIP chair Kulldorff began to move on from the hep B discussion, Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, chimed in asking for more explanation and to call out the committee for muting him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is disrespectful. You want debate and discussion, but you're muting people and silencing them," Goldman said. "Please provide to the public so they can have trust, faith and confidence in vaccination as to what process we are going to be using to properly vet and discuss all future vaccines. … Tell the public how you are going to be analyzing all of these vaccine decisions so we can have confidence in this committee."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff responded that he previously responded to that comment already before moving on to the next agenda matter.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;/div&gt;

The good news is, some simple exercises, when incorporated with a healthy diet and consistency, can significantly lead to a leaner and healthier body. &lt;br&gt;Excess belly fat is associated with serious health issues, including the dangerous visceral fat. A study conducted by Harvard University explains how visceral fat is strongly linked with a higher risk of heart disease. The good thing is, studies have concluded exercising can significantly reduce belly fat. A recent study conducted in the US found that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29127602/"&gt;high-intensity interval training &lt;/a&gt;significantly reduces total fat mass, abdominal fat and visceral fat mass. &lt;br&gt;Visceral fat is metabolically active and tends to respond faster to lifestyle changes.

			&lt;p&gt;If you're already genetically predisposed to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="174203" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, consuming microplastics could trigger cognitive decline, according to a new study in mice from researchers at the University of Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers wanted to see how microplastics might interact with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-diet-can-lower-genetic-risk-for-alzheimers-scientists-discover"&gt;genetic Alzheimer's risk&lt;/a&gt; to make brain dysfunction more likely – a combination of both the genes we're born with and the environment we live in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two groups of mice were used, one with the APOE4 gene variant that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-figure-out-how-an-alzheimer-s-disease-risk-gene-actually-does-its-damage"&gt;increases Alzheimer's risk&lt;/a&gt;, and one with the APOE3 variant that doesn't affect risk. In each group, some of the mice had microplastics added to their drinking water, and some didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/unexpected-link-between-menthol-and-alzheimers-found-in-mice"&gt;Unexpected Link Between Menthol And Alzheimer's Found in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are modifiable factors we're studying related to Alzheimer's – diet, exercise,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="174203" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt;, and especially environmental toxins like microplastics," &lt;a href="https://www.uri.edu/news/2025/09/uri-study-links-microplastic-exposure-to-alzheimers-disease-in-mice/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Jaime Ross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you carry the APOE4, and you happen to consume a lot of microplastics, will this contribute to Alzheimer's disease?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using tests designed to measure cognition, the researchers found that mice with APOE4 that consumed microplastics did begin showing signs of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice with the APOE3 gene, and APOE4 mice that hadn't been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-seem-to-be-in-every-kind-of-animal-except-one"&gt;exposed to microplastics&lt;/a&gt;, behaved normally, suggesting that the combination of genetic risk and microplastics was driving the changes in the animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, the researchers noted sex differences in affected mice. The male APOE4 mice given microplastics showed signs of cognitive decline through apathetic behavior, while the female APOE4 mice given microplastics seemed to have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-name-new-type-of-memory-loss-often-mistaken-for-alzheimers"&gt;impaired memories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This actually matches what we see in humans with Alzheimer's: men with the disease often show &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/geriatrics8040075"&gt;signs of apathy&lt;/a&gt;, while women often experience &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-022-11541-w"&gt;issues with memory&lt;/a&gt;. That makes the microplastics link worth investigating further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you expose animals that are carrying the largest known risk factor in humans for developing Alzheimer's disease to micro and nanoplastics, lo and behold, their behavior changes in a sex-dependent manner similar to the sex-dependent differences we see with Alzheimer's patients," &lt;a href="https://www.uri.edu/news/2025/09/uri-study-links-microplastic-exposure-to-alzheimers-disease-in-mice/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Ross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174207" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174207" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseDiagram.jpg" alt="Mouse experiment" class="wp-image-174207 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseDiagram-600x271.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174207" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at the influence of genes and microplastic exposure on mice. (Gaspar, et al., &lt;em&gt;Environ. Res. Commun.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that some signs of inflammation in the APOE4 microplastics mice matched what would be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-autopsies-reveal-a-potential-culprit-behind-alzheimers"&gt;expected from Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;. The mice didn't develop the disease itself, but did show some changes associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a single APOE4 gene does raise the risk of Alzheimer's in people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-gene-doesnt-guarantee-dementia-heres-what-you-can-do-to-reduce-risk"&gt;quite considerably&lt;/a&gt;, it's still not a guarantee of the disease developing – many people with this genetic risk don't get Alzheimer's. That points to other factors being involved too, and scientists are making progress in understanding what those factors are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on these study results, it seems as though exposure to plastic pollution could be one of these additional factors. We know microplastics can potentially &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-are-infiltrating-your-brain-what-are-the-effects"&gt;get into the brain&lt;/a&gt;, but it's still not clear exactly how harmful this exposure could be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is often the case with Alzheimer's, it's tricky to work out &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-may-start-at-the-brains-borders-scientists-discover"&gt;which brain alterations&lt;/a&gt; might be happening as a result of the disease, and which might be driving it in the first place. While this study only involved mice, it could be significant that Alzheimer's-like changes were seen in a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's interesting that what we're seeing in mice is similar to what we're seeing in the real world," &lt;a href="https://www.uri.edu/news/2025/09/uri-study-links-microplastic-exposure-to-alzheimers-disease-in-mice/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Ross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to encourage further research into the scourge of micro and nanoplastics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2515-7620/adf8ae"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Environmental Research Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He summed up the discussion succinctly: "The only thing that we're discussing here is if there's some benefit or removal of harm that comes from waiting a month. And I have not seen any data that says that there is any benefit to the infant of waiting a month, but there are a number of potential harms to the infant of waiting a month."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panel member Robert Malone, who has falsely claimed that COVID-19 vaccines cause a form of AIDS, explained that the proposed change for the hep B vaccination was not due to any safety concern or evidence-based reason, but about trust among parents who have been exposed to vaccine misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The signal that is prompting this is not one of safety, it is one of trust," Malone said yesterday. "It is one of parents uncomfortable with this medical procedure being performed at birth in a rather unilateral fashion without significant informed consent at a time in particular when there has been a loss of trust in the public health enterprise and vaccines in general."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dashed decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the questions and uncertainties of the proposed recommendation and the data behind it dogged the committee again this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, the voting language was put on a slide and immediately drew criticism. The language was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a mother tests [hepatitis B]-negative:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first dose of the Hepatitis B vaccine is not given until the child is at least one month old.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infants may receive a dose of Hepatitis B vaccine before one month according to individual based decision-making. *&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Also referred to as shared clinical decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hibbeln, the psychiatrist, again pushed back, this time noting that the language of the change is confusing. "You can't say don't give it and then give an opportunity to give it," he said, arguing that shared clinical decision-making is, essentially, all or nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussion quickly spiraled, with another member questioning whether there was any data presented at all on the proposed recommendation. There was a fast motion to table the vote indefinitely, and the motion to table passed in a speedy vote of 11–1, with the ACIP chair, Martin Kulldorff, being the only holdout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the day, the panel is discussing COVID-19 vaccines. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Determines not receiving a dose of COVID-19 vaccine to be an underlying condition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;LANSING, Mich. - In response to &lt;a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/MIEOG/2025/09/17/file_attachments/3390509/ED%202025-7%20Access%20to%20COVID-19%20Vaccines.pdf" class="off-domain-link"&gt;Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s Executive Directive&lt;/a&gt; to state agencies to ensure Michigan families can access COVID-19 vaccines, the state’s Chief Medical Executive Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian has issued a &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/-/media/Project/Websites/mdhhs/CME-Standing-Recommendation-Regarding-2025-COVID-19-Vaccines-FINAL-436pm_09182025.pdf"&gt;Standing Recommendation&lt;/a&gt; for the COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;“National medical organizations and scientific experts continue to recommend routine COVID-19 vaccination for those at high risk, but also recommend vaccines be made available for all those who want them, ages six months and older,” said Bagdasarian. “COVID-19 vaccines have been proven to reduce the likelihood of emergency department or urgent care visits, as well as hospitalizations and severe outcomes. They are one of our best defenses against the virus. As the state’s chief medical executive, it is my duty to protect and promote public health, and everyone deserves the opportunity to access COVID-19 vaccine if they desire one. This Standing Recommendation will help to protect vaccine accessibility and availability in our state.”&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Aug. 27, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the 2025-2026 vaccine for those 65 years of age and older and those ages 5 through 64 years with at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19. However, the FDA did not define the list of underlying conditions. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html" class="off-domain-link"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s list&lt;/a&gt; includes conditions such as obesity and physical inactivity and states it is “not exhaustive” and “should not be used to exclude people with underlying conditions from recommended measures for prevention or treatment of COVID-19.”&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;In her recommendation, Bagdasarian stated, “Any person over the age of six months without contraindication who has not received a dose of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved or -authorized 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccine may be considered to have an underlying condition that puts them at high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 and is thus eligible to receive an age-appropriate dose.”&lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) continues to recommend the COVID-19 vaccine in alignment with the &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/150/3/e2022058700/188297/COVID-19-Vaccines-in-Infants-Children-and?_gl=1*1btcx64*_ga*MjA2NTMzODkyNC4xNzUyODUyNjUz*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3NTMzNjk5MzgkbzIkZzAkdDE3NTMzNjk5MzgkajYwJGwwJGgw*_gcl_au*MTI5NDQyMjA2LjE3NTI4NTI2NTI.*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*czE3NTMzNjk5MzkkbzIkZzAkdDE3NTMzNjk5MzkkajYwJGwwJGgw?autologincheck=redirected" class="off-domain-link"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/family-physician/patient-care/public-health-emergencies/recent-outbreaks/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine.html" class="off-domain-link"&gt;the American Academy of Family Physicians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/videos/get-your-recommended-covid-19-vaccine-during-pregnancy" class="off-domain-link"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                            &lt;p&gt;To help ensure insurance coverage and availability of COVID-19 vaccines as outlined in the Executive Directive, MDHHS is working with the Department of Insurance and Financial Services and the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwl4le003hqgkvga57xg5i@published"&gt;Look up polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, and every definition you find will state that the hormonal disorder manifests in women and people with ovaries of reproductive age. There’s much that scientists still don’t know about PCOS, including how to cure it. But if you &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;know one thing about the condition, I’d guess that it’s the fact that it occurs in women. Unfortunately for the rest of the spectrum of ages and genders, there’s more to the story. PCOS can affect men and children, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1um001u3b79l61qcyju@published"&gt;PCOS is a hormonal condition that affects roughly &lt;a href="https://womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome"&gt;1 in 10 women&lt;/a&gt; between the ages of puberty and menopause. It’s marked by an imbalance of reproductive hormones: Women with PCOS often have elevated androgens, the sex hormone responsible for&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“masculine” traits&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;like excess body hair, acne, and male-pattern hair loss. The hormonal imbalance then disrupts ovulation. Despite its name, women diagnosed with PCOS don’t always have ovarian cysts. But some symptoms are highly suggestive of PCOS, including irregular or missed periods, excessive hair growth on the face and body, acne, weight gain, and difficulty conceiving.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1un001v3b799mnm8k85@published"&gt;Some researchers are &lt;a href="https://answers.childrenshospital.org/rethinking-polycystic-ovary-syndrome/"&gt;studying&lt;/a&gt; the emerging understanding that PCOS isn’t just a women’s condition, but a metabolic disorder affecting people of all genders—and one that could be detected as early as childhood.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“For decades, we’ve seen that first-degree male relatives of women with PCOS are also affected,” says Jia Zhu, a pediatric endocrinologist at Boston Children’s Hospital. There are broader metabolic mechanisms at play that aren’t limited to ovarian function, Zhu says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1un001w3b79wm0xrlwf@published"&gt;While people without ovaries can’t technically be diagnosed with PCOS, research shows they can inherit the same genes that cause PCOS in women, leading to what scientists call the “male equivalent of PCOS.” When men inherit these PCOS genes, they don’t develop reproductive problems like their female relatives would. Instead, they may have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379123001490?via%3Dihub"&gt;metabolic problems&lt;/a&gt; like obesity and insulin resistance, which increase their risk of diabetes and heart disease. Early male-pattern baldness is also associated with PCOS genes.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1un001x3b79rz4aizfy@published"&gt;Given how common obesity, diabetes, and heart disease are, how can physicians be sure these metabolic problems in men are related to PCOS genetics? It’s all about specific patterns (like early baldness &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;metabolic dysfunction) and not isolated symptoms. And there’s one particular genetic research tool, the polygenic risk score, which proves especially helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1un001y3b79cte94ibr@published"&gt;The risk score helps physicians&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;understand how PCOS genetics work in both women and men. It measures how much a person is inherently prone to a disease based on the combined effect of multiple genes, considering hundreds or thousands of tiny differences across the entire length of a person’s genetic material. In their &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8947237/"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt;, Zhu and her team observed a 9 percent increase in the odds of obesity in men for every meaningful increase in the polygenic risk score.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1uo001z3b79tj83rogq@published"&gt;Research also shows that the condition is less age-dependent than previously thought. Children who have a mother, sister, or other close relative affected by PCOS can develop symptoms themselves, Zhu says. “The clinical risk factor is the early development of pubic or [armpit] hair growth before the age of 8 in girls,” she explains. Boys who have genetic exposure to PCOS tend to reach puberty at an earlier age as well. Kids of all genders with higher polygenic risk scores have been shown to have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37690116/"&gt;higher body mass index and increased fat mass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1uo00203b79mpqtnpu3@published"&gt;For now, no standardized approach exists for diagnosing or treating the PCOS equivalent in men and children. Though PCOS is a lifelong disorder with noticeable symptoms, clear-cut diagnosis can only be made in women of reproductive age who have irregular cycles and high androgen levels, says Andrea Dunaif, an endocrinologist at Mount Sinai. “We don’t have really good contrasting traits to make a diagnosis in anybody other than women of reproductive age,” Dunaif notes.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1up00213b79mzdnogs3@published"&gt;Without available tests, Dunaif says parents whose children may have genetic exposure to PCOS should monitor them closely for symptoms, especially rapid weight gain. Obesity can make the other metabolic and reproductive symptoms of PCOS worse, Dunaif says, and it’s more effective to prevent weight gain than to treat high body weight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1up00223b79idizrj58@published"&gt;Zhu hopes we won’t have to rely on that type of symptom-spotting for long. “My ultimate goal is to be able to identify children who have genetic predisposition to PCOS and provide targeted and personalized counseling, and potentially even provide therapeutic options that can be tailored to their genetics,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="57" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfpwv1up00233b79q1jhxm3k@published"&gt;There might come a day when the definition of PCOS will be unrecognizable from today’s ovary-centric view. What we now call a women’s reproductive disorder may be reframed as a metabolic condition that affects entire families, with treatments guided by genetics and not just gender. Until then, at least people with ovaries aren’t in the fight &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted 11-1 to delay a vote on changes to a newborn hepatitis B shot. It was a surprise twist after a lengthy discussion on the hepatitis B vaccine typically delivered to newborns shortly after birth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a00093b6q58dg3aic@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The committee had planned to consider a new recommendation that would wait to give newborns a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine until they are at least a month old. Currently, babies are given this shot at birth, usually before they leave the hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a000a3b6q1sejok4r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine has been recommended in the United States since 1991. After it was implemented, hepatitis B infections in infants dropped from an average of 18,000 per year to around 20 reported cases of hepatitis B in babies per year now. Children infected with hepatitis B nearly always develop longterm infections which can damage the liver, increasing the risk for liver scarring, transplant and cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a000b3b6qti091qup@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After an abrupt and confusing end to Thursday’s meeting, vaccine advisers also cast new votes on Friday on the combined measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox vaccine in the Vaccines for Children program. ACIP members voted Thursday to recommend against using the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine for young children. The new vote on Friday brought the Vaccines for Children program in line with that new recommendation. Nine voted in favor and three members abstained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a000c3b6q2xe34tqu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The advisory group’s recommendation isn’t final. HHS said in a statement Thursday that it “will examine all insurance coverage implications following today’s ACIP recommendation, prior to a final decision on adoption by the Acting Director.” Kennedy deputy Jim O’Neill is serving as acting CDC director after Dr. Susan Monarez was ousted abruptly as head of the agency last month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a000d3b6qezxtgvbp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians and a non-voting ACIP liaison member, told the members on Friday he was concerned about the conflicting MMRV votes case on Thursday, which would have created different recommendations for people of lower socioeconomic levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfquz52a000e3b6qwsiiing4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It suggests, Goldman said, that the second vote “actually revealed the truth that you do not have the data or evidence to challenge the current standing and that there is that there is no associated harm.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Older adults who experience injurious falls are more likely to develop dementia within a year of their accident compared to people of the same age who have other kinds of physical injuries, according to a large study published in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings from a team of researchers in the US do not prove falls contribute to dementia (although this can't yet be ruled out either), but they do suggest that falls could be an early indicator of deteriorating brain conditions that lead to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="174879" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease and&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-isnt-the-only-form-of-dementia-an-expert-explains-the-differences"&gt; other dementias&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of their research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is possible that falls serve as a sentinel event that marks a future risk for dementia,"&lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.36606"&gt; explain&lt;/a&gt; physician Alexander Ordoobadi from Brigham and Women's Hospital and colleagues in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study's findings suggest support for the implementation of cognitive screening in older adults who experience an injurious fall."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-signal-of-dementia-could-be-hidden-in-how-we-read-faces"&gt;An Early Signal of Dementia Could Be Hidden in How We Read Faces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falls are the&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6927a5"&gt; most common way&lt;/a&gt; adults over 65 are injured. Nearly one-third of this age group experiences injury from a fall each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the biggest challenges we face is the lack of ownership in the process of follow-up screening for cognitive impairment," Ordoobadi&lt;a href="https://www.brighamandwomens.org/about-bwh/newsroom/press-releases-detail?id=4814"&gt; says.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because there may not be adequate time for these screenings in an emergency department or trauma center setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year,&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt; almost 10 million new cases of dementia&lt;/a&gt; are diagnosed, leaving more of us to confront frightening cognitive decline either personally or in our loved ones.&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newly-identified-proteins-may-explain-devastating-effects-of-alzheimers"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newly-identified-proteins-may-explain-devastating-effects-of-alzheimers"&gt;Despite decades of &lt;/a&gt;effort, we're still&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-waves-can-be-manipulated-while-we-dream-and-it-could-help-treat-dementia"&gt; without a cure,&lt;/a&gt; leaving patients only with&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext"&gt; strategies to stall&lt;/a&gt; the debilitating conditions' progression, so the earlier dementia can be identified, the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ordoobadi and team analyzed a year's worth of US Medicare claims from those who had experienced a traumatic injury. They identified 2 ,453 ,655 patients over the age of 65 who sought medical assistance for an injury in 2014 or 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149075" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149075" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/SupportWorkerNurseHelpsSeniorManIntoWheelchairDementiaAlzheimers642.jpg" alt="Nurse helps senior man into wheelchair" class="size-full wp-image-149075" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/SupportWorkerNurseHelpsSeniorManIntoWheelchairDementiaAlzheimers642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/SupportWorkerNurseHelpsSeniorManIntoWheelchairDementiaAlzheimers642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/SupportWorkerNurseHelpsSeniorManIntoWheelchairDementiaAlzheimers642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149075" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Falls could be an early indicator of deteriorating brain conditions that lead to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.

Due to a lack of prescription data, the researchers could not account for medication effects, which may have skewed their results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However,&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afs012"&gt; previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have found people with known cognitive impairments are at increased risk of experiencing falls, also supporting the idea that falls may be an early indicator of these devastating brain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other potential earlier warning signs of the cognitive impairments that lead to dementia include&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-vision-can-predict-dementia-12-years-before-diagnosis-study-shows"&gt; loss of visual sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-15-factors-are-linked-to-early-dementia-risk-a-major-study-found"&gt; poor mental &lt;/a&gt;health, and&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-warning-sign-of-dementia-risk-may-be-keeping-you-up-at-night-says-study"&gt; increased nightmares&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But cognitive declines can be an indication of&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/up-to-13-of-dementia-cases-may-be-a-misdiagnosed-treatable-condition"&gt; other treatable conditions too&lt;/a&gt;, so it is critical that potential dementia patients are thoroughly assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study highlights the opportunity to intervene early,"&lt;a href="https://www.brighamandwomens.org/about-bwh/newsroom/press-releases-detail?id=4814"&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; Jarman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we can establish that falls serve as early indicators of dementia, we could identify other precursors and early events that we could intervene on, which would significantly improve our approach to managing cognitive health in older adults."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.36606"&gt; JAMA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in October 2024&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

However, when her symptoms didn't subside, she visited a doctor in September who Lucas said told her she 'looked good' and sent her home to 'drink hot water and honey.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She continued to have chest pain and was feeling very tired, which she continued to blame on moving and the stress of working a busy teaching schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while teaching, Lucas said she 'couldn't finish her sentences without coughing'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her students and colleagues encouraged her to return to the doctors and, after her symptoms worsened, Lucas went to the emergency department on several occasions between September and November 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually, Lucas couldn't walk because she was coughing so much and after months of back and forth, was referred for a PET scan for detailed medical imaging at the end of November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One month later, Lucas was &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14695689/colon-cancers-doctors-alarmed-rise-sharply-young-people.html"&gt;diagnosed with stage three lung cancer&lt;/a&gt; after scans revealed she had three lime-sized tumors in her lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Aurora Lucas had just moved houses when her symptoms of chest soreness and coughing began&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In December 2021, after months of doctors and hospital visits, she was diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucas said: 'I hit a big milestone in August 2021. I bought my first home and instead of celebrating, I was feeling very fatigued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's when the first chest pain showed up and I thought it was because the whole process was so stressful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I even called my sister who's a nurse and she thought maybe it was anxiety.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because Lucas had just spent so much money moving, she didn't want to pay to see a doctor, and she was eager to return to teaching in person in 2021 after being virtual during the Covid pandemic.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Lucas said: 'I could barely do my job. I was very fatigued and I was coughing a lot. I could barely even drive myself home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would almost fall asleep at the wheel - that's how bad the fatigue was and my husband started picking me up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We both thought it was me overworking and being overstressed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucas was urged to visit the doctor by both her students and fellow staff members, but claims she was told by doctors that she 'looked good'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucas said: 'It was my students and colleagues that noticed that I could barely finish my sentences without coughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lucas continues to take targeted therapy tablets, and continues to have check-up scans every four months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lucas underwent two rounds of chemotherapy which started in January 2022, followed by a month of radiotherapy treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was tired all the time, I had chest pain and I would wake up in the middle of the night with sharp back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The cough would not go away even with cough drops and medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The doctor was like "You look so good, you should go home, boil some water and add some honey."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was too stunned to speak.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After months of back and forth, Lucas was eventually sent for a PET scan in November 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucas said: 'I was in and out of the emergency room with those symptoms between September and November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was coughing so much, there was a point where I could barely walk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In December 2021 Lucas received the diagnosis of stage 3A lung cancer. The five-year survival rate is approximately 36 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lucas was diagnosed with stage three lung cancer after scans revealed she had three lime-sized tumors in her lungs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, lung cancer affects about 226,000 Americans per year and about 124,000 are expected to die from the disease in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stage 3A lung cancer is a type of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that indicates a tumor has grown to larger than 5cm and spread to nearby lymph nodes in the chest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;NSCLC specifically accounts for about 85 percent of lung cancer cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The special educator teacher admits she was 'relieved' that she'd finally been given a diagnosis after months of back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucas said: 'When the doctor walked in the room I said "it's cancer isn't it?" and he was like "yes it is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'On the X-ray I had three tumors on my right lung, which were the sizes of limes and the cancer had engulfed the middle part, which were the lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt so relieved. I was so restless of not having any answers and so many doctors kept telling me it was nothing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucas underwent two rounds of chemotherapy which started in January 2022, followed by a month of radiotherapy treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lucas was a newlywed at the time of her diagnosis and had just moved houses and started teaching for the 2021-2022 school year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since March 2022, she has been taking daily targeted therapy pills, and continues to have check-up scans every four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucas said: 'I only had to do two rounds of chemo. I opted out of surgery and suggested we go straight to targeted therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The targeted therapy pill, even with side effects, lets me live a pretty normal life. I have been taking that since 2022 and it's still really working for me now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They haven't declared me cancer free yet. They want to scan me for two more years but I still have to go to scans every four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The tumors have shrunk [and] the doctors described it like ice melting under the sun.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Simon/Science Photo Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have created the first ever viruses designed by artificial intelligence (AI), and they’re capable of hunting down and killing strains of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first time AI systems are able to write coherent genome-scale sequences,” says Brian Hie, a computational biologist at Stanford University, California. “The next step is AI-generated life,” says Hie, but his colleague Samuel King adds that “a lot of experimental advances need to occur in order to design an entire living organism”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, by Hie, King and colleagues, was posted on the preprint server bioRxiv on 17 September&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and is not yet peer reviewed, but the authors say that it shows the potential of AI to design biotechnological tools and therapies for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03033-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03033-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;treating bacterial infections&lt;/a&gt;. “Hopefully, a strategy like this can complement existing phage-therapy strategies and someday augment the therapeutics [to] target pathogens of concern,” says Hie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Genomes from the computer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI models have already been used to generate DNA sequences, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01586-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01586-y" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;single proteins and multi-component complexes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But designing a whole genome is much more challenging owing to complex interactions between genes and gene replication and regulation processes. These AI systems are now capable of helping scientists to manipulate highly intricate biological systems, such as whole genomes, says Hie. “There are many important biological functions that you can only access if you’re able to design complete genomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To design the viral genomes, the researchers used Evo 1 and Evo 2, AI models that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00531-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00531-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;analyse and generate DNA, RNA and protein sequences&lt;/a&gt;. First, they needed a design template, which is a starting sequence that guides the AI model to generate a genome with desired characteristics. They chose ΦX174, a simple single-stranded DNA virus that contains 5,386 nucleotides in 11 genes, and all the genetic elements required to infect hosts and replicate inside them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Evo models had already been trained on more than 2 million phage genomes, but the researchers further trained the models — using a method called supervised learning — to generate ΦX174-like viral genomes with the specific function of infecting &lt;i&gt;E.coli&lt;/i&gt; strains, especially those resistant to antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02601-4" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03055-y/d41586-025-03055-y_27689634.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Five ways science is tackling the antibiotic resistance crisis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers evaluated thousands of AI-generated sequences and narrowed their search down to 302 viable bacteriophages. Most candidates shared more than 40% nucleotide identity with ΦX174, but some had completely different coding sequences. The researchers synthesized DNA from the AI-designed genomes and inserted them into host bacteria to grow phages. These phages were then experimentally tested to see whether they could infect and kill &lt;i&gt;E.coli&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 16 of the 302 AI-designed bacteriophage showed host specificity for &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and could infect the bacteria. The researchers found that combinations of AI-designed phages could infect and kill three different &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; strains, which the wild-type ΦX174 was unable to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was quite a surprising result that was really exciting for us because it shows that this method might potentially be very useful for therapeutics,” says King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Biosafety concerns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nearly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/high-blood-pressure/data-research/facts-stats/index.html#"&gt;half of all Americans have high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; – a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410"&gt;condition called hypertension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypertension is the No. 1 risk factor for heart disease and stroke. In addition, hypertension increases risk of dementia and cognitive decline. Heart disease, stroke and dementia are the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm#"&gt;first-, fourth- and sixth-leading causes of death&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. Unfortunately, only 1 in 4 people with a history of high blood pressure have this condition under control.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In August 2025, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology released &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;new guidelines on prevention and management of hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, based on a comprehensive analysis of literature published over the past 10 years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Conversation U.S. asked &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/24559"&gt;cardiologist Dr. William Cornwell&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to explain what the new guidelines mean and how you can work with your doctor to manage your blood pressure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What are the primary takeaways of the new guidelines?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent guidelines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000065"&gt;prior to this new statement were in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Since that time, the medical community has learned a lot about hypertension and the best way to control it. The new guidelines provide a great deal of new information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the definition of hypertension has changed. The criteria are more strict, and the target blood pressures are lower than in the past.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The criteria depend on the values of the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/which-blood-pressure-number-is-important"&gt;“systolic” and the “diastolic” pressure&lt;/a&gt;. Systolic blood pressure, the top number, represents the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is squeezing blood into the body. Diastolic blood pressure, the bottom number, is the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is relaxing. Both numbers are important when determining the severity of hypertension and how it is most appropriately managed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines have removed the category of “prehypertension,” which was defined by a systolic pressure of 120-139 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), or a diastolic pressure of 80-99 mm Hg. Now, patients are categorized as having “elevated blood pressure” if their blood pressure is 120-129 over less than 80 mm Hg, or stage 1 hypertension if they are 130-139/80-89.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reading of 140/90 or more is considered stage 2 hypertension, and a reading of 180/120 or greater is a hypertensive crisis. In essence, the bar has been lowered, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.125.25466"&gt;this change may impact millions of Americans&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People need to ask their doctors if they have hypertension based on these new criteria and whether or not they should be treated. It is also very important for patients to get advice from their doctors about lifestyle habits that they can incorporate into their daily routine, like diet, exercise and healthy sleep habits to help lower blood pressure.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the guidelines encourage providers to use a risk calculator, called PREVENT – short for &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator"&gt;Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTS&lt;/a&gt; – to determine a patient’s overall risk of cardiovascular disease and heart failure. This tool represents a significant advance in personalizing medical care, since it incorporates risk factors unique to the individual, allowing for a tailored approach to medical care. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Alcohol consumption can lead to narrowing of the arteries, which can cause or worsen high blood pressure.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/medical-concept-showing-artery-plaque-formation-due-royalty-free-image/2229323401?phrase=alcohol%20intake&amp;amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;Chinnachart Martmoh/iStock via Getty Images Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is the link between alcohol intake and high blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidelines encourage people to limit alcohol intake because alcohol increases blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 2023 meta-analysis of seven studies with nearly 20,000 people showed that systolic blood pressure will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.21224"&gt;increase by about 1mmHg for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed&lt;/a&gt;. A standard beer contains about 14 grams of alcohol, so regular alcohol consumption may increase blood pressure by several points over time.  For people who have been drinking an excessive amount of alcohol but stop, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/01.HYP.33.2.653"&gt;their blood pressure may come back down&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That might not sound like much, but when combined with other unhealthy and risky behaviors, like sedentary behavior, excessive weight, inadequate sleep, psychological stress and smoking, the risk factors start to add up quickly. Together, they can very quickly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001303"&gt;increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines encourage patients to reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption entirely compared with the old guidelines. For people who do want to drink alcohol, the new guidelines recommend that men should drink no more than two drinks per day, and women should drink no more than one drink per day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What other lifestyle factors did the new report focus on?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines also emphasize the fact that diet can have a major impact on blood pressure. They recommend that all adults – with or without hypertension – consume less than 2,300 milligrams of salt, or approximately 1 teaspoon, per day, and more ideally, less than 1,500 milligrams per day. For a comparison, the average &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salt/about/index.html"&gt;American eats more than 3,300 milligrams of salt&lt;/a&gt; per day. Patients may also consider potassium-based salt substitutes to further lower blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend a specific diet called the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, short for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, for patients with or without hypertension to prevent or treat elevated blood pressure. The DASH diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, low-fat or nonfat dairy and whole grains. This diet may &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;lead to a reduction in blood pressure by up about 10 mm Hg&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidelines also emphasize the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;need to increase physical activity&lt;/a&gt;. On average, for every additional 30 minutes of aerobic exercise a person gets per week, systolic blood pressure decreases by 2 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure drops by 1 mm Hg, with the largest reduction occurring at 150 minutes of dynamic exercise per week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular exercise also helps you live longer and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/as-wrestling-fans-reel-from-the-sudden-death-of-hulk-hogan-a-cardiologist-explains-how-to-live-long-and-healthy-and-avoid-chronic-disease-262103"&gt;reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/691201/original/file-20250916-56-qq4vqo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The new guidelines recommend that doctors encourage patients to check their blood pressure at home.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/plus-size-woman-using-blood-pressure-meter-to-check-royalty-free-image/2186133131?phrase=blood%20pressure&amp;amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;Kmatta/Moment via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What are the main preventive strategies in the report?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PREVENT risk calculator that the new guidelines recommend incorporates several factors, including demographics, cholesterol levels, medical history and blood pressure, to determine risk. This risk calculator is &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator"&gt;free and available online&lt;/a&gt; to the general public. The PREVENT calculator may be a helpful tool for all Americans since it reliably provides patients and providers with an assessment of overall risk assessment. But it is particularly helpful for people with multiple chronic conditions, like hypertension, high cholesterol, overweight/obesity or diabetes.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association recommends &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8"&gt;eight essential health behaviors&lt;/a&gt; for controlling blood pressure and reducing risk of cardiovascular disease overall.  These include healthy diet, regular exercise, stopping or avoiding smoking, sleeping seven to nine hours per night, and controlling weight, cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Will the new guidelines change how doctors address high blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest advances with these new guidelines is the personalized approach to medical care through the use of the PREVENT calculator. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guidelines recommend that doctors encourage their patients to check blood pressure at home to better understand the fluctuations in pressure that occur throughout the day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the guidelines encourage physicians to be more aggressive about treating blood pressure. This may be an important change since uncontrolled blood pressure is a major risk factor for eventual development of heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the West Coast Health Alliance &lt;a href="https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/PREVENTIONWELLNESS/VACCINESIMMUNIZATION/GETTINGIMMUNIZED/Documents/2025-26-Respiratory-Virus-Vaccine-Recommendations-2-pager.pdf"&gt;released its recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for vaccinations during the 2025-2026 respiratory virus season. That alliance is a new partnership between California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii&lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/17/west-coast-states-issue-joint-vaccine-recommendations-ahead-of-cdc-advisers-meeting/"&gt; to develop parallel recommendations for patients&lt;/a&gt; — bucking the CDC under Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., a longtime skeptic of vaccines. Gov. Gavin Newsom, other blue state governors, medical associations and even some top Republicans nationally have expressed concern that the CDC would not root its recommendations in evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the alliance’s guidance, those older than 6 months should get vaccinated for COVID-19. That sticks closely to the recommendations of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Washington, D.C. health insurance trade association AHIP announced that its scores of members nationally will continue to cover COVID-19 shots through 2026. The group’s members include Aetna, Anthem Blue Cross and Oakland-based Kaiser Permanente, California’s largest private health insurer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public health officials and doctors had expressed concern that insurers would stop covering the cost of COVID-19 shots for many patients after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-covid-shots-fda-kennedy-pfizer-children-9ce19908ae7afb354732aa162fd28532"&gt;limited eligibility&lt;/a&gt; to seniors and younger people with certain medical conditions. The out-of-pocket cost of a shot is reportedly upwards of $200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurers typically incorporate the recommendations of the CDC. In May, Kennedy announced that COVID-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women, and the CDC panel meeting this week is expected to make formal recommendations on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a statement, AHIP said it would rely on the CDC’s vaccine guidance as of September 1, 2025 — effectively ignoring any new recommendations produced by the CDC panel that was hand-picked by Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While health plans continue to operate in an environment shaped by federal and state laws, as well as program and customer requirements, the evidence-based approach to coverage of immunizations will remain consistent,” AHIP said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Kaiser in Northern California said it “is making the new COVID-19 vaccine available to all our members 6 months and older at no cost,” starting September 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kaiser Permanente’s administration of the COVID-19 vaccine is based on the latest scientific evidence and clinical guidance from our physician experts and many other sources, including leading medical societies,” the spokesperson said. “Vaccination remains one of the safest and most effective ways to help protect against severe illness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Zimmerman, a family physician at Temescal Creek Medicine, a small clinic in Oakland, applauded the insurers decision. He said lack of coverage would be a barrier for patients who want to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Vaccination has proven effective at preventing serious cases, hospitalizations and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If somebody can theoretically get a vaccine, but it is the difference between them making a rent payment or not, that is de facto blocked access to care,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Zimmerman said he’d been concerned about the potential out-of-pocket cost of a COVID-19 booster for his patients. He and other doctors at the clinic have written prescriptions for patients who might not fall into the FDA’s new categories for those eligible to get the shot, such as healthy people younger than 65. Like many in the Bay Area, he and his patients had &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/08/bay-area-sees-covid-19-wave-and-tremendous-confusion-about-vaccines__trashed/"&gt;been confused about the shifting rules and whether they qualified&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It shows good faith, it aligns with what we know is best practices, and the science that we know,” said Georges Benjamin, a physician and executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based American Public Health Association. He said the insurers are following what he sees as “the best science and knowledge” — while the CDC does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC committee meeting this week is the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. On Thursday, the &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/09/18/kennedy-advisory-panel-vaccine-vote/"&gt;panel voted to stop recommending a combined shot&lt;/a&gt; for the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine for children under 4 years old; studies have shown children who got the combo shot more often developed a rash, fever and — in rare instances — seizures after vaccination compared with children who got separate shots. Varicella is better known by the name chickenpox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel’s members delayed until Friday reviewing the guidance for vaccinating newborns against hepatitis B , which can &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/08/18/hepatitis-b-liver-cancer-bay-area/"&gt;cause serious liver infections and cancer.&lt;/a&gt; In 1991, the advisory committee recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel is also slated to turn its attention to recommendations for COVID-19 shots on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bay Area, demand for COVID-19 boosters was high this month during a late-summer surge of the virus, but &lt;a href="https://publichealth.santaclaracounty.gov/diseases/covid"&gt;rates of hospitalizations and deaths are low.&lt;/a&gt; The virus continues to pose the most danger to seniors and younger people with other medical conditions that elevate the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s current vaccine recommendations for the flu aren’t different from the guidance of West Coast states; per both sets of guidelines, those older than six months should get an annual shot. The groups also align &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/rsv/index.html"&gt;on RSV vaccination.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The DiFi, GP5D and HT55 cell lines were provided by J. Engelman, and the VACO432 cell line was provided by S. Markowitz. Short tandem repeat profiling was performed to authenticate all cell lines. Cells were cultured in high-glucose DMEM (Fisher Scientific, 11-965-118) supplemented with 10% FBS (Fisher Scientific, 26-140-079). All cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec11"&gt;In vitro sugar experiments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three media formulations were used for in vitro sugar experiments.

For the migration assay, 100 μl of CRC cells (6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; for DLD1, 8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; for HCT116, 4–5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; for HCT8, 5–8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; for RKO and 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; for the remaining nine CRC cell lines) in serum-free assay medium was seeded into the cell culture insert (upper chamber) of a transwell (Fisher Scientific, 07-200-150). The lower chamber was filled with 600 μl of assay medium containing 10% dialysed FBS (Fisher Scientific, SH30079.03). For chemical treatments, compounds were added to both the upper and lower chambers. After incubation for 48–72 h (48–72 h for DLD1 and HCT116, 48 h for HCT8, 60–72 h for RKO and 48 h for the remaining nine CRC cell lines), the bottom surfaces of the inserts were stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich, C0775) in 20% methanol for 10 min. Non-migrated cells on the upper side of the membrane were removed with cotton swabs before analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the invasion assay, 40 μl of 15% Matrigel (Fisher Scientific, CB40230C) in serum-free assay medium was added to the insert, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before cell seeding. Cells were seeded using the same numbers as in the migration assay, and the same assay medium was added. The incubation time for the invasion assay was 24–48 h longer than for the migration assay. After incubation, the bottom surfaces of the inserts were stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich, C0775) in 20% methanol for 10 min, and non-invaded cells on the upper side of the membrane were removed with cotton swabs before analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless otherwise specified, the assay medium used in both migration and invasion assays was glucose-free DMEM supplemented with either 10 mM glucose and 10 mM fructose (Glu + Fru condition) or 20 mM glucose (Glu condition), and 10% dialysed FBS. The compounds used in these assays included fluvastatin (Sigma-Aldrich, PHR1620-1G), FK866 (APExBIO, A4381), (±)-mevalonolactone (a cell-permeable form of mevalonate; Sigma-Aldrich, M4667-1G), metformin (Cayman Chemical, 13118), α-ketobutyrate (Sigma-Aldrich, K401-5G) and nicotinamide (Sigma-Aldrich, N0636). All chemical doses used for migration assays were optimized to minimize cytotoxicity, and cell numbers were measured in parallel using the SYBR Green assay under the same treatment conditions. Although nicotinamide and mevalonolactone did not induce cytotoxicity, FK866, metformin and fluvastatin showed mild cytotoxic effects in certain cell lines, even at optimized concentrations. Therefore, migration data were normalized to cell number to account for potential proliferation differences, as presented in the Extended Data. Significant suppression of migration persisted after normalization, confirming that reduced motility was not solely caused by effects on cell viability. After drying the membranes, images were acquired by microscopy and quantified by measuring the stained area using ImageJ (v.1.54 f).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec13"&gt;Cell growth and viability assays&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the growth assay, CRC cells were seeded into 96-well plates (4,000 cells per well) and cultured for 1–5 days. After incubation, either the SYBR Green I assay or CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, G7571) was used to quantify cell growth, depending on the experiment. For the SYBR Green I assay, the medium was removed and 50 μl of 0.2% SDS was added to each well, followed by 150 μl of diluted SYBR Green I solution (1:750 in water) (Fisher Scientific, S-7567). Fluorescence was measured using a plate reader (BioTek, Synergy H1) at excitation 485 nm and emission 528 nm. For experiments using CellTiter-Glo, the assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For cell viability measurements in transwell-based migration or invasion assays, the same number of cells used in the transwell inserts was seeded into 24-well plates. Cells were cultured under identical conditions (100 μl serum-free assay medium and 600 μl assay medium with 10% dialysed FBS) and for the same durations as the corresponding migration or invasion assays. After incubation, 200 μl of 0.2% SDS was added to each well. Cell lysates were sonicated for five cycles (2 s on, 2 s off, 30% amplitude) using a probe sonicator (Active Motif EpiShear, Q120AM) to homogenize the lysate. Then, 50 μl of the lysate was transferred to a new well, and 150 μl of diluted SYBR Green I solution (1:750 in water) was added. Fluorescence was measured as described above using the same plate reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec14"&gt;Colony formation assay&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clonogenic ability of CRC cells was measured using a previously described protocol&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 45" title="Franken, N.

In brief, 500–2,000 CRC cells per well were seeded into six-well plates under Glu + Fru or Glu conditions and cultured for 10–14 days. The medium was then removed, and each well was washed twice with 2 ml of 1× PBS. Cells were fixed with 400 μl of methanol at room temperature (20–25 °C) for 20 min. After removing the methanol, 1 ml of 0.5% crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich, C0775) in 25% methanol was added to each well and incubated for 40 min. The stain was then removed, and the wells were washed with deionized water.

Male and female NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (strain no. 005557) and housed in a high-barrier facility optimized for immunodeficient mice. Parental and F1 generation NSG mice were used for breeding, and F1 and F2 generation male mice were used for colon mucosal and splenic injection of CRC cells. All mice were housed in a controlled environment (22 ± 1 °C, 60–70% humidity, 12 h light–dark cycle) and fed ad libitum with standard chow (Picolab Rodent Diet 20, 5053).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For sugar treatment experiments, mice were given ad libitum access to either tap water, glucose solution (100 g glucose in 400 ml autoclaved tap water; 25% w/v) or Glu + Fru solution (45 g glucose + 55 g fructose in 400 ml autoclaved tap water; 25% w/v). These special water bottles were changed twice per week. In separate studies, mice received daily oral gavage with Glu + Fru (45 mg glucose + 55 mg fructose in 400 μl tap water), glucose alone (100 mg in 400 μl tap water) or tap water alone (400 μl). All tap water used for mouse treatments was autoclaved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and the MD Anderson Cancer Center.

Male NU/J mice (8 weeks old) with similar body weights were randomly assigned to experimental groups. Before surgery, mice were administered preemptive analgesia with buprenorphine ER (ZooPharm LLC, Rx 255459) and meloxicam (Covetrus, 11695-6936-1), and anaesthetized with 3% isoflurane (Covetrus, 11695-6777-2) in 2 l min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen. The abdominal surgical site was sterilized, and a 1–2 cm incision was made in the skin and abdominal wall musculature to expose the caecum. A single-cell suspension of 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; CRC cells in 30 μl of 100% prechilled Matrigel (Corning, CB40230C) was carefully injected into the caecal wall using 29-gauge insulin syringes (BD Medical, 324702). Excess tumour cells were gently removed using saline-moistened sterile gauze. The caecum was returned to the abdominal cavity, and the incision was closed using absorbable polyglycolic acid 4-0 suture (Ethicon, J303H) and wound clips (CellPoint Scientific, 201-1000). Analgesic drugs were administered for 3 days postoperatively, and wound clips were removed after 10 days. Body weight and food and water consumption were recorded weekly.

NSG mice (8 weeks old) with similar body weights were randomly assigned to experimental groups. Before surgery, mice were administered preemptive analgesia with buprenorphine ER (ZooPharm LLC, Rx 255459) and meloxicam (Covetrus, 11695-6936-1), and anaesthetized with 3% isoflurane (Covetrus, 11695-6777-2) in 2 l min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen. The left abdominal side, previously shaved, was sterilized using three alternating scrubs with 5% povidone–iodine solution (Veterinary Betadine, 67618-154-16) and alcohol prep pads (Covidien, 6818). A 1 cm incision was made in the skin and abdominal wall musculature at the estimated location of the spleen. The spleen was exposed and gently ligated with absorbable polyglycolic acid 4-0 suture. A single-cell suspension of 7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; CRC cells in 30 μl of PBS was injected into the spleen using a 30-gauge syringe (BD, 305106). The spleen was then isolated with the suture and removed using a low-temperature cautery (World Precision Instruments, 500390). The abdominal wall was closed with absorbable suture (Ethicon, J303H), and the skin was closed with wound clips (CellPoint Scientific, 201-1000). Analgesic drugs were administered for 3 days postoperatively, and wound clips were removed after 10 days. Body weight and food and water consumption were recorded weekly. The Lumina In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS) was used to monitor the bioluminescence of labelled cells each week. After 4–6 weeks, all mice from the same cohort were killed on the same date, and necropsies were performed to examine tumour metastasis and collect tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec18"&gt;Colonic mucosal injection mouse model&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The colonoscopy-based colonic mucosal injection of CRC cells was performed as previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Roper, J. et al.

First, the colonoscopy system—consisting of a miniature endoscope (1.9 mm outer diameter), a xenon light source, a triple-chip camera and an air pump (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany)—was set up. NSG mice (8 weeks old) with similar body weights were randomly assigned to experimental groups. Before the experiment, mice were anaesthetized using 3% isoflurane (Covetrus, 11695-6777-2) in 2 l min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen, and the colonoscope was inserted about 2 cm into the rectum. A sterile 30-gauge needle attached to plastic tubing (provided with the colonoscope) was inserted into the working channel, and the needle was advanced into the colonic wall at a 45-degree angle. A single-cell suspension of 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; CRC cells in 40 μl of PBS was injected into the colonic wall (20 μl per site, two sites per mouse). Body weight and food and water consumption were recorded weekly. Colonoscopy was used weekly to visualize colonic tumours after cell implantation. After 4 weeks, all mice from the same cohort were killed on the same date, and necropsies were performed to examine tumour metastasis and collect tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec19"&gt;Measurement of in vivo luminescence in mice using IVIS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice implanted with luciferase-expressing cancer cells were intraperitoneally injected with 100 μl of 15 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; luciferin (Gold Biotechnology, LUCK-1G) per mouse. Then, 7 min later, mice were anaesthetized using the XGI-8 Gas Anesthesia System (PerkinElmer, XGI-8) with 3% isoflurane (Covetrus, 11695-6777-2) in 2 l min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen. Then, 10 min after luciferin injection, mice were transferred to the Lumina IVIS (PerkinElmer). Images with exposure times of 1 s, 5 s, 10 s, 30 s, 1 min and 2 min were acquired according to the equipment manual and used for further analysis. For liver imaging, 10 min after luciferin injection, mice were killed using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and livers were immediately collected and placed in the Lumina IVIS. Images with exposure times of 2 s, 5 s and 10 s were recorded and used for further analysis. Total luminescence values were quantified using Aura Software (Spectral Instruments Imaging, Aura Software, v.4.0.7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec20"&gt;Drug treatments of mice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the FK866 treatment experiment, mice were treated with 10 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; FK866 (APExBIO, A4381) in PBS (Corning, MT 21-040-CV) containing 2% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich, D4540) by intraperitoneal injection. In the simvastatin treatment experiment, mice were treated with 30 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; simvastatin (Selleckchem, S1792) in PBS containing 10% DMSO by oral gavage. During the drug treatment period, mice had ad libitum access to the Glu + Fru solution (25% w/v, 45:55 ratio) in their drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec21"&gt;H&amp;amp;E and immunohistochemistry staining&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouse tissues were placed in tissue cassettes (Thermo, 22-272417) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Santa Cruz, sc-281692) for 24 h at 4 °C. Tissues were then transferred to 70% ethanol (VWR, 89125-188) before processing. Tissue processing, embedding, sectioning and H&amp;amp;E staining were performed by the BCM Breast Cancer Histology Core at BCM. Stained slides were scanned by HistoWiz for bright-field whole-slide scanning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human tissue slides for H&amp;amp;E and SORD immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining were obtained from the Human Tissue Acquisition and Pathology (HTAP) Services at BCM. All original tumour tissues and matched normal tissues (not all samples included matched normal tissues) were collected at the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Hospital, Ben Taub General Hospital and Baylor St. Luke’s Medical Center. Tissue acquisition was based on a system designed to maximize the number of tissues available from BCM-affiliated institutions. The process began with a patient tissue advocate who identified all tissues with the potential to be banked for HTAP each day. A redundant consenting protocol, which included multiple attempts to obtain patient consent, was used. After collection, tissues were barcoded, organized, catalogued and banked in the tissue database. H&amp;amp;E and IHC staining of human tissues were performed by the BCM Breast Cancer Histology Core. The SORD antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, HPA040621) used for IHC staining was validated on SORD KO and SORD-proficient xenograft mouse tissues before application on human slides to ensure antibody specificity. Stained slides were scanned by HistoWiz for bright-field whole-slide scanning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec22"&gt;Human colon tumour organoid and normal colon organoid culture&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human colon tumour organoids were provided by M. L. Martin at Weill Cornell Medicine (the Englander Institute for Precision Medicine), and human normal colon organoids (also called enteroids) were acquired from BCM (Gastrointestinal Experimental Model Systems Core). All 3D cultures of organoids were maintained in 15 μl per drop, totalling five drops (75 μl per well) of Matrigel (Gibco, CB40230C) in 12-well plates (Life Technologies, 150628) with 1 ml of the following medium in a 37 °C, 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; humidified incubator. The medium was changed every 2 days, and organoids and enteroids were passaged at a 1:6 ratio when crowded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medium for culturing human colon tumour organoids contained the following components: Advanced DMEM/F12 (Gibco, 12634010), B27 Supplement (Invitrogen, 17504001) at 1× concentration, &lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-glutamine (Gibco, 25030164) at 2 mM, HEPES (Amresco, J848) at 10 mM, Primocin (Invitrogen, NC9141851) at 100 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, human recombinant EGF (R&amp;amp;D Systems, 236-EG-200) at 50 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, Gastrin I (Sigma-Aldrich, SCP0152) at 10 nM, Y-27632 (cAMP inhibitor; Selleck Chemicals, S1049) at 10 μM, A-83-01 (TGF-β inhibitor; R&amp;amp;D Systems, 2939) at 500 nM, SB202190 (MAPK inhibitor; Selleck Chemicals, S1077) at 3 μM, nicotinamide (Sigma-Aldrich, N3376) at 10 mM, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylcysteine (Sigma-Aldrich, A9165) at 1.25 mM, prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Sigma-Aldrich, P0409) at 10 nM, Noggin (10% conditioned medium), R-spondin (10% conditioned medium) and penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco, 15140-122) at 1× concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medium for culturing human colon organoids contained the following components: Advanced DMEM/F12 (Gibco, 12634010), B27 Supplement (Invitrogen, 17504001) at 1× concentration, &lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-glutamine (Gibco, 25030164) at 2 mM, HEPES (Amresco, J848) at 10 mM, Primocin (Invitrogen, NC9141851) at 100 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, human recombinant EGF (R&amp;amp;D Systems, 236-EG-200) at 50 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, Gastrin I (Sigma-Aldrich, SCP0152) at 10 nM, Y-27632 (cAMP inhibitor; Selleck Chemicals, S1049) at 10 μM, A-83-01 (TGF-β inhibitor; R&amp;amp;D Systems, 2939) at 500 nM, SB202190 (MAPK inhibitor; Selleck Chemicals, S1077) at 10 μM, nicotinamide (Sigma-Aldrich, N3376) at 10 mM, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylcysteine (Sigma-Aldrich, A9165) at 1 mM, prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Sigma-Aldrich, P0409) at 10 nM, penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco, 15140-122) at 1× concentration, Noggin conditioned medium (10%), R-spondin conditioned medium (10%) and WNT-3A conditioned medium (30%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec23"&gt;Human enteroid 2D monolayer differentiation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collagen IV stock solution was prepared by dissolving collagen IV (1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; Sigma-Aldrich, C5533-5MG) in 100 mM acetic acid (0.6% acetic acid in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). A 24-well plate was coated with 500 μl per well of the collagen working solution (prepared by diluting the collagen IV stock 1:30 (v/v) in ice-cold water) and incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Three-dimensional cultured enteroids were dissociated using 500 μl per well of 0.5 mM EDTA (Fisher, BP24821) diluted in PBS. Enteroids from one well of a 12-well plate (approximately 75 μl) were used to seed one well of a 24-well plate. After centrifugation at 300&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; at 4 °C for 5 min, the pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of 0.05% trypsin and 0.5 mM EDTA and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Then, 1 ml of DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS was added, and the mixture was pipetted 60 times to dissociate the cells. Following centrifugation at 400&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; at 4 °C for 5 min, the enteroid pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of enteroid medium and seeded onto the coated plate. After 1 day, the medium was replaced with differentiation medium lacking R-spondin, WNT-3A, nicotinamide and SB202190, and the percentage of Noggin conditioned medium was reduced to 5%. The medium was refreshed every 2 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec24"&gt;Reverse transcription and qPCR&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA from organoids, enteroids and 2D-differentiated enteroids was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, 74136), and cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript IV VILO Kit (Fisher, 11756050) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time qPCR was performed using amfiSure qGreen Q-PCR Master Mix (GenDEPOT, Q5600-010) on a CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad).

Cell extracts were prepared by adding 400 μl of 40:40:20 acetonitrile (ACN):methanol:water containing 0.5% formic acid to each well of a six-well plate, followed by neutralization with 35.2 μl of 15% ammonium bicarbonate. After centrifugation at 20,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were transferred to sample vials (Thermo, 2-SVWGK) for LC–MS analysis. High-performance LC was performed using an XBridge BEH Amide XP Column (Waters, 186006724). Mobile phase A consisted of 5% ACN with 20 mM ammonium acetate and 20 mM ammonium hydroxide (pH 9.75–9.85); mobile phase B was 100% ACN. The column temperature was maintained at 25 °C, and the flow rate was 0.15 ml min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Specifically, 600 μl of −20 °C 3 mM antioxidant monobromobimane (Fisher Scientific, M20381) in methanol (80:20, v/v) was added to cell samples and incubated for 2 h at room temperature, followed by 1 h of incubation at 0 °C. Samples were then centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;, and supernatants were transferred to clean tubes. This extraction step was repeated two additional times, and the combined supernatants were dried using a SpeedVac (Savant) and stored at −80 °C until analysis. For normalization, post-extraction tissue or tumour pellets were solubilized in 800 μl of 0.2 M aqueous NaOH at 95 °C for 60 min, and protein content was quantified using the BCA Assay (Thermo, PI23227). For metabolite analysis, dried extracts were reconstituted in ACN (70:30, v/v) containing 0.025% acetic acid, and 3 μl of the solution was injected for LC–MS. Metabolite profiling was performed using an Agilent 1200 LC system coupled to an Agilent 6230 time-of-flight mass analyser. Chromatographic separation was achieved using aqueous normal-phase gradient separation on a Diamond Hydride column (Microsolv). Mobile phase A consisted of 6 μM EDTA and 0.025% acetic acid in isopropanol (50:50, v/v); mobile phase B consisted of 6 μM EDTA and 5 mM ammonium acetate in ACN (90:10, v/v). The following LC gradient was applied: 0–1.0 min, 99% B; 1.0–15.0 min, 20% B; 15.1–29.0 min, 0% B; and 29.1–37.0 min, 99% B. Both positive and negative ion mass spectra were acquired in 2 GHz (extended dynamic range) mode at 1.41 spectra per second over a mass/charge range of 40–1400 &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;. Data were saved in both centroid and profile modes using Agilent MassHunter Workstation B.06.00 Data Acquisition Software. Raw data files were analysed using Mass Profiler Professional (Agilent, v.B.14.5) and MassHunter Profinder (Agilent, v.B.08.00).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For targeted metabolomics, cell lysates were extracted twice with 500 μl of 80% ice-cold methanol. After centrifugation at 20,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were dried and reconstituted in 15 μl of LC–MS-grade water, then transferred to sample vials (Thermo, 2-SVWGK).

Absolute quantification of mevalonate pathway metabolites was performed by Creative Proteomics using LC–MS. In brief, samples were extracted with 80% methanol as described above, reconstituted in 20 μl of high-performance LC-grade water and 5–7 μl was injected into a hybrid 6500 QTRAP triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX) coupled to a Prominence UFLC HPLC system (Shimadzu). Metabolites were analysed by selected reaction monitoring (SRM), targeting a panel of 300 endogenous water-soluble metabolites. Some metabolites were detected in both positive and negative ion modes, yielding a total of 311 SRM transitions using polarity switching. The electrospray ionization voltage was +4950 V in positive mode and −4,500 V in negative mode. The dwell time was 3 ms per SRM transition, and total cycle time was 1.55 s. Approximately 9–12 data points were acquired per detected metabolite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For mevalonate pathway metabolite measurements, cells cultured in 10 cm dishes were washed with 5 ml cold PBS and extracted with 1 ml of 80% methanol, then placed on ice for 1 h. The extracts were centrifuged at 16,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 15 min, and 100 μl of the supernatant was stored for analysis. The remaining 900 μl was dried using a SpeedVac (Eppendorf, Vacufuge) and reconstituted in 80 μl of 80% methanol. For LC–MS analysis, 5 μl of both unconcentrated and concentrated samples was injected. LC was performed using an XBridge BEH Amide XP Column (Waters, 186006724). Mobile phase A consisted of 5% ACN with 20 mM ammonium acetate and 20 mM ammonium hydroxide (pH 9.75–9.85); mobile phase B was 100% ACN.

Data were processed and analysed using TraceFinder software (Thermo, OPTON-31001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the measurement of sorbitol in both cells and medium at different time points, cells were cultured in six-well plates under the indicated conditions, as shown in the figures. At the end of treatment, 1 ml of medium was mixed with 3 ml of methanol and centrifuged at 16,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 20 min. The supernatants were then dried using a SpeedVac (Eppendorf, Vacufuge) and reconstituted in 400 μl of 80% methanol per sample by 10 min of water-bath sonication (Branson, 2800). Samples were centrifuged at 16,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 20 min, and 5 μl of the supernatant was used for LC–MS injection. Meanwhile, the remaining medium was removed, and cells were washed with 2 ml of cold PBS, then extracted with 1 ml of 80% methanol and placed on ice for 1 h. The extracts were centrifuged at 16,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 15 min, and 5 μl of the supernatant was used for LC–MS injection. LC was performed using an XBridge BEH Amide XP column (Waters, 186006724) under negative ion mode, as described above for mevalonate pathway metabolite measurements. MS was carried out using a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer system (Thermo), and data were processed and analysed using TraceFinder software (Thermo, OPTON-31001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec31"&gt;RNA-seq and data analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total RNA was extracted from SORD WT (Cas9-expressing control cells) and KO cells derived from HCT116 and DLD1 using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, 74136). Before RNA extraction, cells were cultured under Glu + Fru conditions for 48 h. Sample quality control, RNA-seq and data analysis were performed by Novogene. In brief, after isolation, RNA integrity and quantification were assessed using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit with the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies). Qualified samples had an RNA Integrity Number value of &amp;gt;10. Libraries were generated using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, E7530L) following the manufacturer’s protocols, with index codes added. Clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using the PE Cluster Kit cBot-HS (Illumina), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After cluster generation, library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina platform to generate paired-end reads. Following quality control checks for Q20, Q30 and GC content, the paired-end clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using STAR (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference). Gene-level quantification was performed with FeatureCounts, and differential expression analysis was conducted using the DESeq2 R package. Differentially expressed genes were identified using the edgeR R package; those with a false discovery rate of &amp;lt;0.05 and |log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(fold change)| &amp;gt; 0.5 were used for pathway analysis with Qiagen Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.

Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer dataset were obtained from the UCSC Xena database. OncoGEO B37 and B38 datasets were obtained from QIAGEN OmicSoft Lands. The expression levels of SORD and AKR1B1 in normal tissue, primary tumour and metastatic tumour groups were extracted from these datasets and compared using unpaired &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests or one-way ANOVA. Analysis of scRNA-seq data was performed using the Human Colon Cancer Atlas (c295) dataset via the Single Cell Portal (&lt;a href="https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell"&gt;https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec33"&gt;Statistics and reproducibility&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All animals were randomly grouped.
