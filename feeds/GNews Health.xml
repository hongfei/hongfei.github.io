&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other key lifestyle changes include quitting smoking, cutting back on alcohol, and regular cholesterol checks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's also important to exercise more to help lower cholesterol levels; the health body advises everybody to do at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This could be broken down into daily brisk walks, cycling, or swimming – any movement that feels like a workout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Try a few different exercises to find something you like doing," the NHS says.

He joined a high-end longevity clinic for a few hundred dollars a month and began monitoring his blood panels, eating better and improving his sleep. He wanted to stay active as he aged — playing tennis, surfing, hiking and spending time with his young daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But during Mr. Provissiero’s annual physical at the longevity clinic, his physician, Dr. Darshan Shah, gave him a sobering warning. Despite his healthy habits, Mr. Provissiero’s blood sugar was nearing &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/well/blood-sugar-levels-diabetes.html" title=""&gt;prediabetic levels&lt;/a&gt;. A family history heightened his risk of developing diabetes, which can shave years off a person’s life expectancy. When a stricter diet and exercise regimen didn’t move the needle, Dr. Shah prescribed metformin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Scientists have known for decades that metformin lowers blood sugar. It’s approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat Type 2 diabetes and is also commonly prescribed for weight loss and polycystic ovary syndrome. But some doctors, including Mr. Provissiero’s, are betting this same drug can head off a number of chronic diseases before they even develop, to help otherwise healthy people live longer and better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The hope is that this is going to lead to a greater number of healthy years,” said Mr. Provissiero, who lives in Malibu, Calif. After one year on metformin, he said he feels less bloated, more energetic and more in control of his weight and blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Research on metformin’s impact on the human life span is scant. The existing research, much of which has been done on mice, is “all over the place,” showing varying effects based on the animals’ sex and species, said Rafael de Cabo, a senior investigator at the National Institute on Aging who has studied metformin in mice for over two decades. Human studies, which have largely focused on diabetes patients, turn up conflicting findings on metformin’s benefits for healthy people, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Still, interest in metformin’s anti-aging potential has remained high as scientists find early but promising evidence that it could also manage or delay other conditions like &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.diabetesresearchclinicalpractice.com/article/S0168-8227(19)31471-8/abstract" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-022-04649-4" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2810994" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;. “Metformin may be targeting the root cause” of several other diseases whose risks increase with age, potentially because it regulates hormones, repairs tissues and eases immune system inflammation, Dr. de Cabo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

has a dark secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The community of just over 15,000 residents has &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14647121/subtle-clue-EYE-dementia-45-retinal-thinning.html"&gt;one of the highest dementia rates&lt;/a&gt; in America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One in four people here over the age of 65 have it compared to around one in 10 nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And that is probably only the 'tip of the iceberg', according to Dr Gladys Maestre, director  of a dedicated dementia and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14635517/virus-herpes-shingles-SEVEN-TIMES-early-dementia.html"&gt;Alzheimer's research program&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told the Daily Mail the number of sufferers is likely 'much, much higher', as many people don't have health insurance and cases therefore go unreported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Residents in the city and the surrounding Starr County area say that almost everyone has someone in their family impacted by the condition, which causes loss of memory, language, problem-solving and other thinking abilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Maestre: 'Access to health is difficult in the area, so I believe we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg. I have also seen so many people aged around 50 already sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The only way to give accurate estimations is by doing an epidemiological study, door by door in this case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While it might appear a sleepy border town with an interesting history, Rio Grande City in southern Texas has a dark secret. The low laying community of just over 15,000 residents has one of the highest dementia rates in America, at around 25 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Asked what is behind the staggering number of dementia patients in Starr County, Dr Maestre says poverty is one big factor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The region has a poverty rate of around 30 percent, which is more than double the national average of just under 12 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe lower wages and disadvantaged neighborhoods can put people at a greater risk of dementia due to various factors including poorer air quality, a greater reliance on cars or bus transportation over walking, fewer social interactions and more stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Maestre says she believes that pollutants in the area are another big contributor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She identifies a handful of toxins that have been found in the water supply and in the town's old houses, many of which date back to the early and mid 19th century. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include arsenic which has been linked to reduced memory and intellectual abilities in children and adolescents, and cadmium, which is a carcinogen released into the environment through industrial and agricultural activities, known for contributing to the development of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another factor Dr Maestre highlights is the extreme heat in south Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A growing body of research has indicated a link between extreme heat and an increased risk of dementia-related deaths and hospitalizations, particularly among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study of over three million Medicare patients in New England found that temperature increases of 1.5C (34.7F) led to a 12 per cent rise in hospital admissions for dementia sufferers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation explains that heat can trigger dementia because 'prolonged exposure to the hot summer sun can place too much stress on the body, which negatively impacts cognitive function.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr James Falcon has been working with his physician father Antonio to lead more research into the problems plaguing Starr County&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Earlier this month it emerged that the remains of an 84-year-old Maria Soprano had been found in the city of Roma in Starr County after her family reported her missing. Authorities confirmed that she suffered from dementia and Alzheimer's&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Starr County, temperatures range from an average minimum of 44F in January to an average maximum of 99F in July, while the average annual temperature is 74F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is another factor creating a 'perfect storm' for dementia, says the doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The region is also heavily Hispanic and this demographic group is 1.5 times more likely to be affected by dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the exact reasons for this disparity are still being investigated, research suggests several factors may contribute, including cardiovascular disease, socioeconomic status, and potential genetic predispositions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with Dr Maestre, another leading dementia specialist in the region is Dr James Falcon, who has been working with his physician father Antonio to lead more research into the problems plaguing Starr County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The former soldier, who served in Afghanistan before returning to Rio Grande City, previously told Today: 'There isn't a single one of us that works here [in the clinic] that doesn't  know somebody personally that has been affected by this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For a while growing up we were the poorest county in the country, that's the reality of where we live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Working here in the clinic, there isn't a day that goes by where we don't see somebody with some kind of memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A lot of people are early in the course of their disease [but] you see pretty advanced patients.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services reports that 459,000 Texans have been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, around 12 percent of the state’s population over the age of 65&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In Starr County, temperatures range from an average minimum of 44F in January to an average maximum of 99F in July, while the average annual temperature is 74F&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mayra Garza, who has been helping as a volunteer at the Falcon's El Faro Health and Therapeutics clinic in Rio Grande City on Alzheimer's research, explains that it is an issue close to her heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: 'My family has been highly impacted by this Alzheimer's disease, both my parents have / had it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is important to understand why this is impacting me and my family.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this month it emerged that the remains of an 84-year-old woman suffering from dementia had been found in the city of Roma in Starr County after her family reported her missing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Authorities confirmed that Maria Soprano suffered from dementia and Alzheimer's, which may have contributed to her becoming disoriented and lost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Maestre told this website that urgent action needs to be taken to prevent such devastating events from happening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She concludes: 'I think this is a perfect storm, where environmental issues and adverse early life experiences come together to make the brain more vulnerable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I say life experiences I mean not only pollutants, I mean extreme heat, and a car-centric environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To make progress, we need more research on what is going on, and more infrastructure for care and prevention.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last week the Texas House passed a Senate bill that would create a $3 billion Texas research fund for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas, if it goes ahead, would issue grants for research and encourage collaboration among universities, medical institutions and other experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services reports that 459,000 Texans have been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, around 12 percent of the state’s population over the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms include forgetfulness, irritability, struggling to follow a conversation or find the right word and being confused about time and place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 05:45:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

id="mol-53b2aca0-25cc-11f0-889f-83acd4978611" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; found there were 25,000 visits between 2022 and 2023 - about 68 per day - for symptoms related to semaglutide, the main ingredient in the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common complaints were nausea, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal complications such as vomiting and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other side effects sending people to the hospital were hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), allergic reactions and medication errors - such as people taking more of the drug than prescribed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers did not detail the extent of people's side effects nor if there were any deaths related to semaglutide, but DailyMail.com has spoken to victims who began suffering from hearing loss, uncontrollable bowel movements, hair loss, vision loss, pancreatitis and &lt;a target="_self"

report found majority of the ED visits - 80 percent - occurred in 2023 as the use of semaglutide medications soared. It is estimated about 13 percent of Americans - 33million people - have ever tried at least one weight-loss drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The come amid growing concern about adverse side effects, and the researchers are urging doctors to do a better job at educating patients regarding use and side effects of semaglutide, as well as help manage their use of any other medications they are on before starting Ozempic or Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dawn Heidlebaugh (pictured), a mother-of-four from Ohio, said taking Ozempic left her feeling suicidal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC researchers analyzed data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance Project (NEISS-CADES).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The database keeps track of drug-related adverse events reported to a nationally representative sample of emergency departments in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on 551 documented cases, the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-03258"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;estimated 24,499 ED visits were due to semaglutide use between 2022 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of those, 70 percent were for GI symptoms, including 58 percent for nausea and vomiting, 25 percent with abdominal pain and 12 percent with diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seventeen percent of ED visits were because of low blood sugar and six percent of people were experiencing an allergic reaction to the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nine percent of the visits involved medication error.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the visits to the ED, about one-third of people with low blood sugar and 15 percent of people with GI symptoms were admitted to the hospital for closer observation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study did not reveal if any deaths related to the medications occurred. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain, vomiting and constipation are listed as common side effects of Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More severe side effects listed include thyroid tumors, changes in vision, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, dehydration and kidney complications, allergic reactions, food or liquid getting into the lungs and gallbladder complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After being resigned to being obese, Brad Roberts couldn't believe it when he lost 24lbs in a month on weight loss drugs. However, in a shocking turn of events, the 44-year-old father-of-four and his wife Stacey are suing the doctor who prescribed him the weight loss drugs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to these, Wegovy also lists depression or suicidal thoughts, kidney failure, and increased heart rate as side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one lawsuit, Ozempic user Brad Roberts claims&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14507341/ozempic-dieter-suing-doctor-treating-weight-loss-drug.html"&gt; the drug caused debilitating joint and muscle pain&lt;/a&gt;, as well as severe stomachaches that confined him to his bed for 18 hours a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other claims in the lawsuit include that he has trouble walking and suffers from memory loss, vision problems and issues communicating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one of the court documents obtained by DailyMail.com, Dr Yadira Lockard, a psychologist who has served as Roberts' therapist since January 2015, describes his deterioration after he was allegedly 'dangerously' overmedicated with weight loss drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she noticed a concerning change in his behavior about a year into his weight loss and eventually his condition deteriorated until he no longer had 'the mental capacity to make life decisions of any particular consequence to himself or on behalf of his family.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the FDA has received hundreds of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12636411/ozempic-weight-loss-suicide-thoughts-depression-fda.html"&gt;reports of suicidal thoughts and depression from patients on weight loss medications&lt;/a&gt; since 2010, as well as 36 deaths 'by suicide or suspected suicide.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of 2023, 265 reports of suicidal thoughts and depression among people on weight-loss drugs had been received by the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/wegovy-other-weight-loss-drugs-scrutinized-over-reports-suicidal-thoughts-2023-09-28/"&gt;Reuters &lt;/a&gt;reported, though instances of suicidal thoughts on the drugs are unverified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A DailyMail.com investigation last year revealed dozens of patients were suing Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, claiming they experienced extreme side effects they were not warned about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most of the patients claim they suffered from gastroparesis - stomach paralysis. The condition, which can be life-threatening, causes a build-up of food in the gut and symptoms include nausea, vomiting and severe pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brea Hand, 23, told DailyMail.com she required five hospital visits before doctors diagnosed her with gastroparesis, which was allegedly caused by Ozempic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DailyMail.com reviewed more than a dozen lawsuits filed between November 2023 and January 2024 by patients who were diagnosed with gastroparesis after using Ozempic and Wegovy, including some who suffered 'life-threatening' bowel injuries and now face lifelong consequences.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one case, a woman who used Ozempic and Mounjaro claims she was diagnosed with gastroparesis, which caused her to vomit so much some of her teeth feel out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another, a woman was diagnosed with a 'life-threatening bowel injury' after using Ozempic and underwent surgery that lasted nearly nine hours. Doctors said she would be in pain 'for the rest of her life' and 'will never have a solid bowel movement again.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the number of semaglutide-related hospital visits is concerning, it is on par with visits for side effects from other drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2021 &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8493432/#:~:text=Based%20on%2096%E2%80%89925%20cases%20(mean%20patient%20age%2C%2049%20years%3B%2055%25%20female)%2C%20there%20were%20an%20estimated%206.1%20(95%25%20CI%2C%204.8%2D7.5)%20ED%20visits%20for%20medication%20harms%20per%201000%20population%20annually%20and%2038.6%25%20(95%25%20CI%2C%2035.2%25%2D41.9%25)%20resulted%20in%20hospitalization."&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found roughly six in 1,000 Americans visit the ED every year due to medication-related complications and a 2022 &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34757641/"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found over-the-counter cough or cold medications cause about 27,000 ED visits in the US every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 02:32:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>美国100个性传播疾病热点城市揭晓：这座令人震惊的富裕小镇隐藏着肮脏的秘密--《每日邮报》 | America's 100 STD hotspot cities revealed: And the shocking wealthy town with a dirty secret - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQQlJNT3p3Mnc5LUNseGRpaWZheEFOaFpIMHRZUUFMUHJRQTgxVU5PNVFTTlJ5OGZUaDBfUENONHNOY205Zm1OR1BHQmRaLUdYQVJCUllVMldZYTBZano5MDJyTGM4NzZDRFBMOUNLaEdoS3NPRUtSenBjYk0zVXJRbDJONXZvTVoxdTEzamM4enlNNmVFSjBkSUxqQmlXT29QNkxzX2tnTjM4d9IBrwFBVV95cUxOU3JzdHdSQmRObXhxSE44ZFFyMTctVWpwS21wSzR4QVJpYnNvTEdXb0REX0l6NEFDMkpaYUV2N0RUdFBxUEE2d3FPdi05Rm1jSnZrUmJLOXUtYlVrWndzM2dQTVdGWW05aWxsUm10M0lSQ2RKaWVVTHZsQ1FoUS1IZ09ibDF2dWFybG9OLU95cE9DamFvd3VtM0VPbTMyd3Q2a2pINDBQMTVRaFowcGxr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cities in the eastern half of the US may be rife with sexually transmitted infections, a new analysis shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Innerbody Research, a medical website run by a team of scientists, examined &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-b8147080-253f-11f0-91e0-fd96e094411a" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;'s 2023 data for rates of STIs across America and found the 10 cities with the highest rate of infections, with Detroit, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/michigan/index.html" id="mol-b81756b0-253f-11f0-91e0-fd96e094411a"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, topping the list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Midwestern city had about 1,500 infections per 100,000 residents in 2023, jumping eight places from the previous year's report.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was followed by Philadelphia, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-212b29e0-25c4-11f0-b349-7df794508157"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;

Baltimore, Maryland and New Orleans, Louisiana, made up fourth, fifth and sixth places, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;For the first time ever, the team named Detroit City as the metro area with the highest overall STI rates across the country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Washington DC was &lt;span&gt;found to have a rate of 1,334 overall STI cases per 100,000 people as of 2023. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Broken down, there were 22,738 cases of chlamydia, 6,450 cases of gonorrhea, 489 cases of syphilis and 593 cases of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hiv_aids/index.html" id="mol-cb0bde61-2541-11f0-91e0-fd96e094411a" class=""&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The city, where reports suggest it takes having a net worth of over $2million to feel wealthy, has reportedly seen an uptick of cases among younger generations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Shenell Williams-Davis, a sexual health coordinator with Mary’s Center Public Health Outreach Services in DC, new dating trends and relationship structures may be to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtoninformer.com/std-rates-washington-dc/"&gt;The Washington Informer&lt;/a&gt;: 'The doors of [varied sexual preferences] have opened up, and a lot of people are starting to experience [a multitude of things]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's no longer just one-on-one [sexual relationships], but [people experiencing multiple partner relationships]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So that brings the issue where I may treat three people, but where are the other two in the group, or I can treat three, but where are the other four people? This [creates a breeding ground] for reinfection.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Despite making up only a quarter of the population, young people between 15 to 24 years old account up for about half of new STIs every year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Years of rising rates of STIs has culminated in what experts call a&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14074021/Americas-STD-explosion-laid-bare-shocking-number-people-catching-one-minute.html"&gt; public health crisis&lt;/a&gt;, driven by decreased condom usage and poor sex education. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Detroit saw &lt;/span&gt;20,830 cases of chlamydia, 7,983 cases of gonorrhea, 628 cases of syphilis and 386 cases of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hiv_aids/index.html" id="mol-4784c6d0-25f3-11f0-ba72-17419599ac08" class=""&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Across the US, Chlamydia is &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6784019/STD-rates-soar-record-high-driven-rising-rates-40s.html" class=""&gt;the most common STI&lt;/a&gt;, with 492.2 cases per 100,000 people as of 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the rate is increasing, mostly driven by a recent uptick in the number of seniors citizens contracting chlamydia due to increased sexual activity in later life, limited sexual health education, low condom use and the misconception that STIs don't affect older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is often called a 'silent infection' as many people experience no symptoms but if they do appear, they can be mild and may not show up for several weeks after exposure - making it easier to spread as people keep having unprotected sex without knowing they are suffering from the illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms of chlamydia include abnormal or foul-smelling vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, abdominal tenderness, pain during intercourse, irregular bleeding, and fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Untreated chlamydia can lead to several long-term complications, primarily affecting reproductive health, including infertility and ectopic pregnancy in women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Gonorrhea cases fell for a second year in 2024, declining seven percent from 2022 to below pre-pandemic levels due to an increased availability of at-home STI kits. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Untreated gonorrhea can lead to serious health issues, including pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. And while the infection can usually be easily treated, some strains are resistant to commonly used antibiotics - making them harder to clear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Syphilis has increased by one percent nationwide and the rise - while small - is worrying public health officials, as the disease can advance to damage the brain, nerves, eyes, and heart if it goes untreated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is most commonly reported among 30- to 34-year-olds, a slightly older group compared to other infections due to peak sexual activity during those years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms begin with small open sores on the genitals, mouth, or rectum, as well as enlarged lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the second stage, a skin rash develops, as well as genitals sores, fever, muscle and joint pain, vision changes, and loss of appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the infection advances further, it can inflame and damage heart valves and slowly degrade the brain, causing personality changes, memory loss, difficulty making decisions, and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While most of the illnesses can be cured with a round of antibiotics and abstinence from sex, HIV can attack the body's immune system and lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once infected with HIV, there is no effective cure currently and proper medical care to control the virus is required. In the US, approximately 8,000 people die each year from HIV-related illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Washington DC was found to have 1,334 overall STI cases per 100,000 people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People, particularly young people, are using condoms less regularly. They went from the top contraceptive tool for 75 percent of men in 2011 to 42 percent of men by 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite making up only a quarter of the population, young people between 15 to 24 years old account up for about half of new STIs every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in 100 US adults has an STI, including over 209,000 cases of syphilis, over 600,000 cases of gonorrhea, and over 1.6million &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-64252/What-symptoms-chlamydia.html"&gt;cases of chlamydia&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, there are some positive signs that a decade-long rise could be plateauing and even turning a corner. There were 2.4million sexually transmitted infections in 2023, a two percent decline from 2022.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eric Rodriguez, CEO and co-founder of Innerbody Research, SAID: 'The number one thing that an individual can do to help address this issue is to get tested more frequently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What we've found is that people don't realize how important it is to get tested regularly, because many STDs are manageable if they are caught early. Many of them are curable.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers from China studied 25 volunteers classed as obese over a period of 62 days, during which they took part in an intermittent energy restriction (IER) program – a regime that involves careful control of calorie intake and relative &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/is-intermittent-fasting-or-calorie-counting-better-for-weight-loss-new-study-weighs-in"&gt;fasting on some days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did the participants in the study lose weight – 7.6 kilograms (16.8 pounds) or 7.8 percent of their body weight on average – there was also evidence of shifts in the activity of obesity-related regions of the brain, and in the make-up of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-contain-a-variety-of-microbiomes-heres-a-look-at-a-few-of-the-most-important"&gt;gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Here we show that an IER diet changes the human brain-gut-microbiome axis," &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2023/12/20/frontiers-cellular-infection-microbiology-weight-loss-changes-microbiome-brain-coupled"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; health researcher Qiang Zeng from the Second Medical Center and National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Diseases in China when the results were published in December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The observed changes in the gut microbiome and in the activity in addiction-related brain regions during and after weight loss are highly dynamic and coupled over time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144243" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144243" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/IntermittentFastingConceptFoodOnPlate642.jpg" alt="Food on a wooden plate in one section with cutlery placed to like hands on a clock" class="size-full wp-image-144243" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/IntermittentFastingConceptFoodOnPlate642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/IntermittentFastingConceptFoodOnPlate642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/IntermittentFastingConceptFoodOnPlate642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144243" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;An IER diet involves careful control of calorie intake and relative fasting on some days. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFjkkQB-bU/"&gt;vetrestudio/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear what causes these changes, or whether the gut is influencing the brain or vice versa. However, we do know that the gut and the brain are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-study-pinpoints-specific-gut-bacteria-linked-to-alzheimers"&gt;closely linked&lt;/a&gt;, so treating certain regions of the brain could be a way to control food intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes in brain activity, spotted via &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"&gt;functional magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; (fMRI) scans, were in regions known to be important in the regulation of appetite and addiction – including the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_part_of_inferior_frontal_gyrus"&gt;inferior frontal orbital gyrus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, the gut microbiome changes, analyzed via stool samples and blood measurements, were linked to particular brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the bacteria &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprococcus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coprococcus comes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobutyricum_hallii"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eubacterium hallii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were negatively associated with activity in the left inferior frontal orbital gyrus, an area involved in executive function, including our willpower when it comes to food intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The gut microbiome is thought to communicate with the brain in a complex, two-directional way," &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2023/12/20/frontiers-cellular-infection-microbiology-weight-loss-changes-microbiome-brain-coupled"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; medical scientist Xiaoning Wang from the State Clinic Center for Geriatrics in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The microbiome produces neurotransmitters and neurotoxins which access the brain through nerves and the blood circulation. In return the brain controls eating behavior, while nutrients from our diet change the composition of the gut microbiome."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144241" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144241" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ChildEatingWatermelon642-1.jpg" alt="A child eating a slice of watermelon" class="size-full wp-image-144241" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ChildEatingWatermelon642-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ChildEatingWatermelon642-1-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ChildEatingWatermelon642-1-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144241" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Nutrients from our diet change the composition of the gut microbiome. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFHfMD27oY/"&gt;corelens/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/04-03-2022-world-obesity-day-2022-accelerating-action-to-stop-obesity"&gt;More than a billion&lt;/a&gt; people worldwide are estimated to have obesity, which leads to an increased risk for a multitude of different health issues, from  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="159793" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing more about how our brains and guts are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/obesity-can-trigger-lasting-changes-in-the-brains-nutrient-response-study-finds"&gt;dependent on each other&lt;/a&gt; could make a huge difference in effectively preventing and reducing obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The next question to be answered is the precise mechanism by which the gut microbiome and the brain communicate in obese people, including during weight loss," &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2023/12/20/frontiers-cellular-infection-microbiology-weight-loss-changes-microbiome-brain-coupled"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Liming Wang from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What specific gut microbiome and brain regions are critical for successful weight loss and maintaining a healthy weight?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2023.1269548/full"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in December 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One case is in a suburban Cook County adult resident whose vaccination status is unknown. The other case is in a Chicago adult resident who traveled internationally through O’Hare International Airport in early April, who previously had one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to a news release from the Cook County, Chicago and Illinois departments of public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suburban Cook County resident went to a hospital for medical care Monday and was quickly isolated, according to health officials. The Chicago resident developed a rash April 25 and has been isolating at home since being diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are warning that people who were at the following locations on the following dates may have been exposed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 21: Chicago Public Library – Independence Branch, 4024 N. Elston Ave., Chicago&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 21: Fittingly Delicious, 3939 W. Irving Park Road, Chicago&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 22: O’Hare Airport, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., especially in Terminal 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 23: O’Hare Airport, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., especially in Terminal 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 25: Aldi, 7235 39th St., Lyons, from 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 27:  Shell, 3901 S. Harlem Ave., Stickney, from 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April 28: Mobil: 2945 S. Harlem Ave., Berwyn, from 10:20 a.m. to 1 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who may have been exposed should notify their health care providers if they are unsure about their vaccination status. If they develop symptoms they should talk to their health care providers or a health care facility before going to a medical office or emergency department, so the facility can take steps to prevent other patients and health care providers from being exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine are considered 97% protective against the measles, and one dose is considered 93% protective. Children typically receive the first dose of the vaccine, or the similar measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox) vaccine at age 12 to 15 months, and the second dose from ages 4 to 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cook County cases follow the &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/04/24/marion-first-measles-case/"&gt;first case of measles this year in Illinois&lt;/a&gt; in an unvaccinated adult in downstate Marion, reported last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also come amid a surge of cases nationwide, as people express wariness of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;As of April 24, there had been 884 confirmed measles cases across the country, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. That’s the second-highest number of cases in the U.S. in 25 years, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm?s_cid=mm7414a1_w"&gt;a CDC report&lt;/a&gt; released in April. In the U.S., two children and one adult have died of the illness so far this year, all of whom were unvaccinated — the first U.S. measles deaths in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas has had the largest outbreak, with 663 cases as of April 29, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt;. Of those 663 cases, 635 have been in individuals who were either unvaccinated or had unknown vaccinaton statuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are experiencing a resurgence of measles in the United States, despite the fact that two doses of the MMR vaccine can prevent it,” said Dr. Kiran Joshi, interim chief operating officer at the Cook County Department of Public Health, in a news release. “Misinformation has contributed to declining vaccination rates and fueled recent outbreaks. The MMR vaccine has been in use for over 50 years, is highly effective, and has protected millions of lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious virus that can spread through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. Symptoms include a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes and can appear up to 21 days after a person is exposed. Complications from measles can lead to pneumonia, seizures, hearing loss and brain damage, and the illness can be especially dangerous for babies, young children, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State and local health officials in Illinois say people ages 12 months and older who plan to travel out of the country should make sure they have two doses of the vaccine at least two weeks before traveling. They are also urging anyone vaccinated before 1968 to check with their health care provider about potentially being revaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can check their medical records or contact their health care providers to see their vaccination statuses. They can also visit the Illinois Department of Public Health’s online portal, &lt;a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/vaxverify.html?utm_source=sfmc&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=CDPH+Encourages+Measles+Vaccination&amp;amp;utm_term=https%3a%2f%2fdph.illinois.gov%2fvaxverify.html&amp;amp;utm_id=1333387&amp;amp;sfmc_id=128588093"&gt;Vax Verify&lt;/a&gt;, to check their immunization status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination appointments are available at Cook County Health community health centers in Chicago and suburban Cook County by calling 833-308-1988. The Chicago Department of Public Health offers free MMR vaccinations at clinics throughout the city. People can register for appointments at &lt;a href="http://getvaxchi.chicago.gov"&gt;getvaxchi.chicago.gov&lt;/a&gt; or by calling the clinics, though the clinics also take walk-ins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cook County Department of Public Health is investigating the case in suburban Cook County, and the city health department is investigating the Chicago case. The departments are working together to identify and notify people who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/05/30/citys-public-health-department-declares-measle-outbreak-over-according-to-report/"&gt;Illinois’ last cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; were in March 2024, when 67 cases were reported, with most linked to a Chicago shelter for migrants on the Lower West Side. That outbreak was the largest in Illinois since 1990, according to the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;

One driver is the overuse of antibiotics, with greater exposure to drugs offering bacteria more chances to learn how to evade them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But a focus on overuse has meant access has been neglected, the experts warn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00108-2/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study, published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;, is the first to quantify the treatment gap in low- and middle-income countries. It was led by the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GardP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers focused on Bangladesh, Brazil, Egypt, India, Kenya, Mexico, Pakistan and South Africa, and used modelling data on the number of cases of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative (CRGN) infections, which are drug-resistant and on the rise. They then looked at sales data for eight types of antibiotic that could be used as treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Across the eight countries, there were an estimated 1.5m CRGN infections and almost 480,000 deaths in 2019. Just under 104,000 courses of antibiotics active against CRGNs were procured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Appropriate antibiotics were available in only 6.9% of cases on average – ranging from 0.2% in Kenya to 14.9% in Mexico and Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cohn, GardP’s global access director, said it was a pattern likely to be repeated in other poorer nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The infections in the study included pneumonias, bloodstream infections and complicated urinary tract infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The “No 1 thing” the lack of drugs did was to drive morbidity and mortality, Cohn stressed, but it could also drive AMR. Trying other, ineffective antibiotics, was likely to mean a longer duration of antibiotic use – &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38833103/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;linked in studies&lt;/a&gt; to increases in resistant bacteria. Killing drug-resistant bacteria with the correct treatment would stop them spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There were many factors behind the treatment gap, she said. Sick people may not make it to a hospital for diagnosis, or those who do may not be able to afford treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We are focusing introduction of newer antibiotics in the US and in a few countries in Europe. That’s not where the burden is,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We are really trying to change the narrative to say we can’t just focus on stewardship, surveillance and containment in low- and middle-income communities, while we’re focused on just innovation in high-income countries. We actually have to focus on both all at once, in all places.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-15" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Global Dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"global-dispatch","successDescription":"Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After the volley, his soldiers collected the arrows and fired them back, winning the day with weapons supplied by the opposition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one centuries later, microbiologists have uncovered a molecular echo of that famous ploy inside common gut bacteria that can defeat viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the &lt;a href="https://www.ku.dk/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.hzau.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Huazhong Agricultural University&lt;/a&gt; have found that &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;coli&lt;/em&gt; carries a previously unknown antiviral system they have named “Kongming.” Like its namesake, the defense hijacks a viral enzyme to launch a counterstrike that ultimately destroys the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their work reveals a completely new immune signaling pathway in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-gut-bacteria-behave-like-vampires-to-target-human-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. It also widens the catalog of phage-resistance strategies and hints at applications ranging from cancer diagnostics to next-generation antibiotic alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-turning-viruses-against-themselves"&gt;Turning viruses against themselves&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every virus that infects bacteria, or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bacteriophages-use-selfish-genetic-elements-as-weapons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;phage&lt;/a&gt;, must replicate its genetic material at breakneck speed to outpace cellular defenses. Many phages therefore inject specialized nucleotide kinases, enzymes that churn out the building blocks of DNA and RNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kongming system detects that very enzyme and forces it to synthesize a different molecule altogether: a distinctive nucleotide signal known as dITP. Once made, dITP activates a protein complex, triggering a cascade that leads the bacterial cell to self-destruct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve discovered a new antiviral signaling pathway in bacteria that, ironically, relies on a viral enzyme to produce the alarm signal that triggers defense – just like the historical Kongming, who used the production of enemy’s own arrows against them,” said Professor Rafael Pinilla-Redondo, co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the phage hands the bacterium the very biochemical arrow that brings about its demise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bacteria-die-to-defeat-viruses"&gt;Bacteria die to defeat viruses&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suicide might sound like an odd way to survive infection, but in bacterial colonies it can be remarkably effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The bacterium sacrifices itself to stop the virus – which may sound dramatic, but it’s an incredibly effective strategy. By dying, it takes the virus down with it, preventing the infection from spreading to other bacteria in the population. It’s a bit like blowing up a bridge to stop an advancing enemy,” Pinilla-Redondo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because phages must complete their replication cycles inside living hosts, the premature death of a single cell prevents the release of hundreds of viral progeny. A few sacrificial cells can protect the community – much like programmed cell death in the human immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-viruses-can-launch-counter-attacks"&gt;Viruses can launch counter attacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phages are not passive targets. The scientists observed that some viruses carry auxiliary enzymes able to degrade dITP before it reaches lethal levels, effectively cutting the alarm wires. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some viruses have figured out how to get around Kongming,” noted first-author Ruiliang Zhao, a doctoral candidate in Pinilla-Redondo’s lab. “They carry special enzymes that break down the molecules needed to trigger the system. It’s their way of cutting off the cables of the alarm before it goes off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such counterintelligence highlights the ongoing evolutionary arms race between microbes and their viral predators, a contest that has spawned &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/crispr-gene-editing-gets-a-revolutionary-upgrade-with-new-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CRISPR&lt;/a&gt;, toxin–antitoxin modules, and now the Kongming pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kongming-beyond-the-gut"&gt;Kongming beyond the gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although initially characterized in &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, genetic sleuthing revealed dozens of Kongming-like operons in soil and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/23-new-marine-bacteria-species-discovered-that-influence-global-ocean-cycles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;marine bacteria&lt;/a&gt; across the globe. This suggests that the mechanism is not a niche curiosity but a broadly distributed archetype for bacteria to defeat viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mapping its genetic hallmarks, scientists can begin to predict which environmental microbes harbor similar systems. This information is critical for biogeochemical modeling and for developing phage therapies that must bypass native immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-therapy-blocked-by-bacteria"&gt;Therapy blocked by bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of antibiotic resistance has rekindled interest in treating infections with phages tailored to kill specific pathogens. Yet a therapeutic phage will fail if its target bacterium possesses a potent defense like Kongming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To develop effective phage therapies, we need to understand the natural immune systems bacteria use to resist viral attacks,” noted Pinilla-Redondo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detailed knowledge of Kongming and its viral countermeasures can guide the selection, or engineering of phages that slip past bacterial alarms, improving clinical success rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-biotech-uses-for-kongming"&gt;Biotech uses for Kongming&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s significance is not limited to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/the-infectious-disease-landscape-is-changing-and-we-must-prepare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;infectious disease&lt;/a&gt; control. Because the Kongming effector complex responds exclusively to dITP, a non-canonical nucleotide implicated in genomic instability and certain cancers, it could serve as a molecular sensor for diagnostic assays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since the Kongming immune effector complex specifically responds to dITP, it could be used to detect this non-canonical nucleotide – opening the door to interesting biotechnological applications,” Zhao said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synthetic biologists may also harness the pathway to build programmable cell-death switches or precision gene-editing safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-bacterial-immunity-revealed"&gt;New bacterial immunity revealed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, comparative genomics has uncovered an astonishing diversity of bacterial antiviral systems, yet many remain poorly understood. Kongming demonstrates how a fresh look can rewrite assumptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, hijacking a viral enzyme to synthesize an immune signal was a trick known only in certain viruses themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery shows that bacteria use viral “enemy arrows” to fight viruses, highlighting a richer immune toolkit in nature than once believed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By turning a pathogen’s own resource into an executioner, the Kongming system offers an elegant illustration of molecular jiu-jitsu – one that not only deepens our understanding of microbial warfare but also points the way toward innovative therapies and diagnostic technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ads6055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 22:21:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPNHZoNE85NnRMSlA1bjJFbXA5WXR3UEVoMl9Nb1dVOU5aS3ctV212OHZ5dUN4dUlyY0pyNnFvOHp5N29SVXJfTTNHQngzTXhuRmdmTldIVDJkdkNURFZGLUVYT0JpRm56M0tSQkpIUkZBTzI4bG9EUVFEZ3JLLXpKSjg4ckhQekVERl84eA</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州麻疹爆发|感染者参加了德克萨斯游骑兵队的比赛- WFAA | Texas measles outbreak | Infected person attended Texas Rangers game - WFAA</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwJBVV95cUxNN2JlTFFOX0oyeTBHY1pfMHk3M0RmMG1hUEpZOG5RbHNKMFpnNFp6cG53V0hrSHNVNjNfRWFTZE4zYm45M3VUOVhYaEI0dmpld2FjUkVITWZyNDdSSFhKVDlfcDhOWjVvSFJCUEdWYklPS3VyZy10dzFISWtiM2NLbnJjWmJxVUNxSEJVZ3JSMTdsdklyUFRlaWwtX3c3T0FvYzRmU3VLOEJaQW16dkQ3RUp3aTZPS2V3N1RvanREay1rV1dFWFN5c3lRd242dkp2czlJd2ZoWmIzQUdCSlNzSXUzWVNpLVEta2UyM3U4QkFoa2E4UFQ2OHpQaS1SQ1QyM3hnVlVnTWpYOVNkRUJn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;“Today’s case is further evidence that measles cases are on the rise – and the DFW area is no exception,” said Denton County Public Health Director Matt Richardson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DENTON COUNTY, Texas — Another North Texas county became the latest to report its first case of measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denton County Public Health (DCPH) announced Wednesday that an adult of unknown vaccination status contracted measles. The case marks &lt;a href="/article/news/1-case-of-measles-reported-in-denton-county-health-officials-confirm/287-825c9a39-af8f-422d-8cce-8e2a4d084ef3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the first in Denton County since 2019&lt;/a&gt; during a smaller statewide outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today’s case is further evidence that measles cases are on the rise – and the DFW area is no exception,” said Dr. Matt Richardson, Denton County's Director of Public Health. “While we haven’t linked this case to an existing outbreak, it highlights two realities: vaccines are important, and if you have signs and symptoms, you should be tested.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious virus that can be serious and fatal if untreated. &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas-updates-numbers-cases-dfw-dallas-everything-need-know/287-b3720460-9d97-4d3c-b646-f056c40a3807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Click here for more information about measles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Denton County health officials, the person went to several places after exposure. Most notably, they attended the April 19 Texas Rangers game against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Globe Life Field in Arlington, officials said. 39,244 people attended that game. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tgnaNewNode"&gt;Here's everywhere the person went:&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_embed"&gt;
                                    
                                &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a connection is unconfirmed, this case comes amid an &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas-updates-numbers-cases-dfw-dallas-everything-need-know/287-b3720460-9d97-4d3c-b646-f056c40a3807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;outbreak of measles statewide&lt;/a&gt;, which originated in a West Texas Mennonite community and has recently &lt;a href="/article/news/health/collin-county-measles-case-child-middle-school-dfw-lucas-lovejoy/287-6a6a61a9-b683-4f4c-a3dd-60e186340205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;spread to parts of North Texas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than&lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas-updates-numbers-cases-dfw-dallas-everything-need-know/287-b3720460-9d97-4d3c-b646-f056c40a3807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; 660 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; have been reported across Texas, and two children in Lubbock &lt;a href="/article/news/health/texas-measles-death-outbreak-lubbock/285-636380ac-1d18-4404-999d-b804f40137af" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;have died from the virus&lt;/a&gt;, according to April 29 numbers from state health officials. At least 87 of those people have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Denton County case announcement comes just one day after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited Texas. During his &lt;a href="/article/news/health/tx-tribune-texas-measles-robert-kennedy-autism/500-1306662b-4730-45cc-8517-2576daa64755" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;short appearance in College Station&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy downplayed the outbreak, saying more attention should be paid to diabetes and autism.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

The parasite needed to spread infectious disease like malaria is not present here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, it was a different story 200 years ago when malaria was common in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It was present in the east of Scotland in particular and spread by native mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Today, climate change is likely to mean we could see more mosquitoes in Scotland, as our climate becomes warmer and wetter - perfect conditions to allow them to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Culex pipiens, the common house mosquito, has been found to carry and transmit the Usutu virus, originally discovered in the 1950s in Africa and present in Europe for the past three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito and has affected blackbird populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Mosquito Scotland project will continue to help track their population and scientists say it will help provide a crucial early warning system for potential risk, as the species respond to environmental change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Professor Ferguson and Dr Kirby want to hear more from the public in 2025, to help increase their knowledge and build a picture of the biodiversity benefits of mosquitoes and any potential risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;You can get involved in the project and submit your own sightings by visiting the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mosquito-scotland.com/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Mosquito Scotland website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 22:06:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1UZUhWMTcxVi1xdGYwMl9pc0Z4dkZoeDZIaGNZNzlhSVhOZG96MUlMUDZ3UHo4bHQtbjd6cTdPVTJJRHYzT1M0TS1oYTF5dGRUZkw3WEJYMU9jQdIBX0FVX3lxTFB6MnIwRVVObHRkWEs3Z3NGMUpHNEZCeElOLXVEemdhQzdJVVoyR3NUVGNmSW1LVU9oMkRDRC1BWXp5N2t1V2RxUXY1aWhiTGcyaVlVY2xhTHpzdUhyTFJz</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.的HHS命令研究致命传染病的实验室停止研究- WIRED | RFK Jr.'s HHS Orders Lab Studying Deadly Infectious Diseases to Stop Research - WIRED</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE90UU5PblVYckI0cnFfZjFtMWlzT3RTYjZQYzQyQjNOZVgtNG5rc3J4ekplR0VWU0laOWc4Znd4b1FuT3pWMXdDOENibE8wWWgxeVRteXhyTTAtRjVJek9NYmN2Z1dfOHFVdVJiS0htOGxvME5wMnRzVXZR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research facility within the US &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/nih/"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; that is tasked with studying &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/ebola/"&gt;Ebola&lt;/a&gt; and other deadly infectious diseases has been instructed by the Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/department-health-human-services-possible-collapse/"&gt;Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)&lt;/a&gt; to stop research activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;According to an email viewed by WIRED, the Integrated Research Facility in Frederick, Maryland was told to stop all experimental work by April 29 at 5 pm. The facility is part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and is located at the US Army base Fort Detrick. It conducts research on the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases that are deemed “high consequence”—those that pose significant risks to public health. It has 168 employees, including federal workers and contractors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The email, sent by Michael Holbrook, associate director for high containment at the Integrated Research Facility, says the lab is terminating studies on Lassa fever, SARS-Cov-2, and Eastern equine encephalitis, or EEE, a rare but lethal mosquito-borne disease that has been reported in several Northern US states. “We are collecting as many samples as is reasonable to ensure these studies are of value,” he says in the email. “We have not been asked to euthanize any animals so these animals will continue to be managed.” Holbrook did not respond to an inquiry from WIRED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The email says representatives from the Department of Homeland Security were padlocking freezers in BSL-4 labs, those with the highest level of biosafety containment used for studying highly dangerous microbes. Only about a dozen BSL-4 labs exist in North America. These labs work with the viruses that cause Ebola, Lassa fever, and Marburg, types of hemorrhagic fevers. The Integrated Research Facility is one of few places in the world that is able to perform medical imaging on animals infected with BSL-4 agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“The sacrifice to research is immense,” says Gigi Kwik Gronvall, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, on the closure. “If things are unused for a period of time, it will cost more money to get them ready to be used again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The facility’s director, Connie Schmaljohn, has also been placed on administrative leave, according to the email. Previously, Schmaljohn served as a senior research scientist at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. She has more than 200 research publications and her work has led to several clinical trials of first-of-their kind vaccines. Schmaljohn also did not respond to an inquiry from WIRED.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In an emailed statement provided to WIRED, Bradley Moss, communication director for the office of research services at NIH, confirmed the halt in research activity. “NIH has implemented a research pause—referred to as a safety stand-down—at the Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick. This decision follows identification and documentation of personnel issues involving contract staff that compromised the facility’s safety culture, prompting this research pause. During the stand-down, no research will be conducted, and access will be limited to essential personnel only, to safeguard the facility and its resources.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Moss did not elaborate on the nature of the personnel issues, and said he did not know how long the research pause would last. Staff have not received an anticipated reopening date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The research pause is the latest disruption to federal science agencies after HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restructuring-doge.html"&gt;announced at the end of March&lt;/a&gt; that 10,000 people across the vast federal health agency would lose their jobs, including those at the National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The mass layoffs are part of a restructuring plan being carried out by President Donald Trump’s so-called &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-digital-coup-doge-data-ai/"&gt;Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 21:53:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE90UU5PblVYckI0cnFfZjFtMWlzT3RTYjZQYzQyQjNOZVgtNG5rc3J4ekplR0VWU0laOWc4Znd4b1FuT3pWMXdDOENibE8wWWgxeVRteXhyTTAtRjVJek9NYmN2Z1dfOHFVdVJiS0htOGxvME5wMnRzVXZR</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，家庭测试大大降低了这种癌症的死亡率-旧金山纪事报 | At-home tests dramatically reduced death rates for this kind of cancer, study finds - San Francisco Chronicle</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQeHRqV19XWGo2R0NrcWI5ay1hM2gyNnhuaEhVT3ZjNkdHdy15blRtUnVBdDZrOWhtdnNqN1V6WDZsbFFGblBpNVB0TDBrUUVUM0tCdno5a1NkeklEeUFxc1RkTU5BM0RYTi1wMUlLVktqVDRzNXc2WVdHd2FBMHpTcmRXYU56djdDTXlSTklwU054Y3kzUGE1NV93bw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

The state says these hospitalizations are from earlier in the outbreak, and the numbers may increase as DSHS receives records for earlier cases. The number of people currently in the hospital for measles has not been released.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Since January, 16 cases have been reported in people who were considered fully vaccinated and 12 cases in people who only had one dose of the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;In Texas, two school-aged children have died from complications with the measles. Both were not vaccinated and had no known underlying conditions, state health officials said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-d11d7278&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is measles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p original-article-post="" data-v-ec26887a data-v-d11d7278&gt;Why you should care:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with infectious droplets or by airborne spread when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Measles virus can remain infectious in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves an area. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Illness onset (high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes) begins a week or two after someone is exposed. A few days later, the telltale rash breaks out as flat, red spots on the face and then spreads down the neck and trunk to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;A person is contagious from about four days before the rash appears to four days after. People with measles should stay home from work or school during that period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-d11d7278&gt;Symptoms of Measles&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Common symptoms of measles include: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul original-article-post="" data-v-03e8ff79 data-v-d11d7278&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;High fever (as high as 105°F)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Cough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Runny nose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Red and watery eyes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Tiny white spots that may appear inside the mouth 2-3 days after symptoms begin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Rash 3-5 days after other signs of illness. The "measles rash" typically starts at the face and then spreads down to the rest of the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-d11d7278&gt;How to prevent getting measles&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;The best way to prevent getting sick is to be immunized with two doses of a vaccine against measles, which is primarily administered as the combination measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Some vaccinated people can occasionally develop measles; however, they generally experience milder symptoms and are less likely to spread the disease to other people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-d11d7278&gt;What to do if you've been exposed to measles&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;If you think you have measles or have been exposed to someone with measles, isolate yourself from others and call your healthcare provider before arriving to be tested so they can prepare for your arrival without exposing other people to the virus. Measles is extremely contagious and can cause life-threatening illness to anyone who is not protected against the virus.

It mainly affects the lungs and can also cause damage to the brain, spinal cord and lymph nodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It most commonly spreads through the air when infected people cough or speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once known as consumption, TB is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14332367/Tuberculosis-outbreak-Kansas.html"&gt;one of the deadliest diseases in the world&lt;/a&gt; and according to WHO, over 10 million people across the globe were diagnosed with the illness out of which nearly two million died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, over 10,000 Americans were diagnosed with the infection and 565 died in 2024, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Florida state officials have confirmed a case of active tuberculosis in a Fort Lauderdale high school. (Stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MR Broomfield said in a letter addressed to school parents: 'DOH-Broward and BCPS [Broward County Public Schools] have identified and notified those individuals who have been determined to be a close contact, at this time. No further action is needed unless you are contacted directly.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier, this year an 'unprecedented' tuberculosis outbreak occurred in Kansas -  which left 147 people infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Out of this 67 people became actively ill and 80 contracted the illness but showed no symptoms. Two patients have died, as of now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2024, Florida reported 681 tuberculosis (TB) cases - a nine percent increase from 2023.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of 2025, TB cases are increasing both globally and in the United States due to higher international travel and migration, increased reporting, reactivation of latent TB infections and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children, older people and those with weak immune systems are most at risk of contracting TB - leading to permanent lung damage, even after successful treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB is mostly spread through an exchange of germs containing the bacteria through the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of active TB in the lungs usually begin gradually and worsen over a few weeks and signs can include coughing up blood or mucus, chest pains, pain with breathing or coughing, fever, chills and night sweats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People can protect themselves against TB by getting the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, but it is not generally not on the vaccination schedule in the US due to the low risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Florida Department of Health said that a member of Dillard High School in Broward County (pictured) with active tuberculosis was recently present on campus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tuberculosis, also called TB, is a fatal illness caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria and mainly affects the lungs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If infected, patients are asked to remain isolated and must take antibiotics for six months to treat TB. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If left untreated, the bacterial infection can damage the lungs and spread to other parts of their body such as the brain, kidneys and spine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people become infected with TB germs that live in the body for years without causing illness. This is known as inactive TB or latent TB. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However without treatment, one in 10 people with inactive TB will get sick with active TB disease, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 21:35:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQekVjMnJBc0lJbU9QaVU4TjdmWm5UOHJNVVNtalZhc3owWjdRZzdWZW1FWWhZcW9hRGZIaEZMMWpGZElZUnNmbXYyMHFQSzZFOGpSNzlUREdnbEM2QW5nQnA5MlpvU1ROTEdmWGdlaGY3MzJIWEZUMXhkTUcwT0JDQS1GTlBwcVBnUTRBclFJTHVIUUhIQWRHYWlIVzRqZXlCcUVPQ3BRV2_SAa4BQVVfeXFMTVhmWlRTVUg4QlV2MUFxcVpZOWVPZ09UVFFNaHMwcHFvOEpHOVhUblI4UjFEX0lCT0kwYi12QjF6MlJnWjRpOTZXclV2ZzJ2WURxYU9CX0cyaUxGU01LajlFSFhxQnJreTEwbW9EN1YyNXpzZS1MYktoM2pjbVdQa3RGZ0ZoRkJYcXpRR0lMT18xWnpPZjF3Tmh2UTg3d3hQWUh3SUdmNi0zRHA2dEtB</guid></item><item><title>难以制作可可和辣椒？科学家炮制万无一失的解决方案-泰晤士报 | Struggling to make cacio e pepe?

However, the researchers said this was an inadequate method.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Preparing cacio e pepe successfully depends on getting the balance just right, particularly the ratio of starch to cheese,” they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“The concentration of starch plays a crucial role in keeping the sauce creamy and smooth, without clumps or separation. If the starch content is less than 1 per cent of the cheese weight, the sauce is prone to separating into unpleasant clumps. The pasta water alone does not contain enough starch to stabilise the sauce effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Their solution? Use a powdered starch, such as cornflour or potato starch, instead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For example, for two people, the researchers recommended mixing 5g of starch with 50ml of water before heating it in a pan until almost clear. Then add 100ml of cool water, mix again, before adding 200g of grated cheese and a good grind of black pepper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="5.5"&gt;&lt;div id="48f30e4e-14c5-4677-9fb9-c6864a43ea3d"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Crouch said that 200g for two people was more than an entire block of pecorino from Tesco&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;JACK TAYLOR FOR THE TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Meanwhile, cook 300g pasta in slightly salted water until it is al dente. Save some of the pasta cooking water before draining. Once the pasta has been drained, let it cool down for up to a minute to prevent the excessive heat from destabilising the sauce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Finally, mix the pasta with the sauce, ensuring even coating, and adjust the consistency by gradually adding ­reserved pasta water as needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dr Daniel Busiello, a co-author of the study and a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, said when cheese was heated, its proteins changed their configuration and began to aggregate or clump together. Starch, he said, helped prevent this by binding to the proteins and reducing the chance of them sticking to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The researchers ran several experiments to find the perfect cheese-to-water ratio, using different concentrations of starch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="5.11"&gt;&lt;div id="41744620-4d4f-4835-9bef-f24ca8f36502"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Crouch using cornflour in the sauce while preparing the dish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;JACK TAYLOR FOR THE TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;They also consumed a huge amount of cheese. Dr Ivan Di Terlizzi, another co-author of the paper, told The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/apr/29/physicists-find-key-to-perfect-pasta-but-not-how-mamma-used-to-make-it" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; that the team consumed about 6kg of cheese for the study. He said: “Although we are still not tired of this delicious dish, one of the authors had blood tests showing very high cholesterol levels. It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/27de6d5c-d6d6-4682-be58-21fa3f18a68f" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;price of science&lt;/a&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, not everyone is convinced. Antonio Alderuccio, an Italian chef based in &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/topic/london-food-drink" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, said: “I’m not sure I’d try the scientists’ recipe. I’m sure it works but I believe you can get a smooth sauce without going to these lengths. The key is properly grating the cheese and using really fresh pecorino — it incorporates much more easily. The sauce only splits if you add too much water. You’ll need about half an average-sized glass for 300g of pasta.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Taste test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I must admit, I’m more of a by-eye cook than a technical one — an instinct I surely inherited from my Italian nonna, who never measured anything, Giulia Crouch writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I’m too lazy to weigh ingredients — it takes the fun out of cooking. But some recipes demand precision, and the Roman classic cacio e pepe is definitely one of them. My usual trick is to reserve plenty of pasta water so I can tweak the sauce’s consistency at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;But since these scientists went to all this trouble I thought I’d try their version. The method is relatively straightforward, though I can’t say the starchy slurry looked appetising as it bubbled away on the hob.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="5.19"&gt;&lt;div id="827d06a5-d1f4-4ed0-ab37-ebadb0fdd0ec"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Crouch trying the finished product&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;JACK TAYLOR FOR THE TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;What did impress me was the scientists’ generous cheese recommendation — 200g for two people, which was more than an entire block of pecorino from Tesco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In their paper they write: “The amount of cheese can, of course, vary depending on personal taste. Traditionalists would insist on using only Pecorino Romano DOP but some argue that up to 30 per cent Parmigiano Reggiano DOP is acceptable, though this remains a point of debate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Naturally I went for the full 200g, throwing in a bit of Parmigiano Reggiano for good measure and because I didn’t have enough pecorino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The instruction to let the pasta cool slightly before mixing felt counterintuitive — pasta doesn’t usually like to sit around as it has a tendency to stick. And perhaps, by the time I’d grated such a gigantic mound of cheese, it had cooled a little too much. Still, once I added the cheesy starchy mix to my spaghetti, it all came together beautifully and the kitchen smelt glorious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So, how did it taste?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Well, great. But then pasta and cheese rarely disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;As for the all-important matter of consistency, I’m sad to report that it wasn’t the best. I’ve definitely had silkier, more luxurious cacio e pepe in the past. Whether this is down to a flaw in the recipe or my execution, I guess we’ll never know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 21:30:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNNmIxUjFoS1N3V1pob3p2VHZUUDFfSWVqRDJTcmw0eG9sazJ4QU1NenZQRUF5X3JuLVg2YlJTdUExdWxrN0JnTGE0MXdpYVFtMGxyVEtlcnRlZTJ3QkhKeFIxWnhHRDM4MjZqekpYTFVYMzE3bnRTV3NqZGpiRDBKNE9zNUNhMDBRMDAxOUNTNFhUcVVq</guid></item><item><title>金毛猎犬的人性化汽车坐姿给孩子们带来全面的童趣- PetHelpful | Golden Retriever’s Human-Like Way of Sitting in Car Gives Total Kid Vibes - PetHelpful</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxOYnB4WV9nNDJ3X3pPcDNDY1pseUpNcjF3c2l0dFU2di1YUGNMZTU0Rkxsa1lWQUNGY1ZTano2dmZ6d05jaThxSHl0bTk5X0hsT2hzZ2piRnAyR2tHTzk5NGhlcVRhbWg4WDB2djlWd1pVR3NBa0ljT2NLUE1xWm94ZGlMcUFKdEtCbXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PetHelpful</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxOYnB4WV9nNDJ3X3pPcDNDY1pseUpNcjF3c2l0dFU2di1YUGNMZTU0Rkxsa1lWQUNGY1ZTano2dmZ6d05jaThxSHl0bTk5X0hsT2hzZ2piRnAyR2tHTzk5NGhlcVRhbWg4WDB2djlWd1pVR3NBa0ljT2NLUE1xWm94ZGlMcUFKdEtCbXc</guid></item><item><title>金毛猎犬的人性化坐在车里给孩子们带来共鸣-雅虎 | Golden Retriever's Human-Like Way of Sitting in Car Gives Total Kid Vibes - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxOVDFJdURCeHpVdTk1M0o4WEJaNXBJWGRlSGV5N0IwRndQa1MwcVdJSGdlajNjNFI4U0VKT2g0alR2VkFjekxTOE9oNThjQ1VZVUdVWmtjTmMxTno5bzdna296LUlnaTJ4bEFZVVg4dUEzWHVGVFZpNkxYaXBLRncyXzFFNFdwVE0yMmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You know who loves the car?

They can be tricky! And as a pet lover, it can be scary to travel with your dog and keep them safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;First things first, it’s best to travel with your dog in a crate that’s safely attached to the floor of the car. You want to make sure they’re ready before the trip by taking them to the bathroom and for a long walk to get all their energy out. It’s okay if they’re a little tired! It will help keep them calm throughout the trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other helpful tools are pee pads, treats, and some plastic bags in case of accidents. If your dog gets car sick, some vets might prescribe them medication. In short, it’s all about being prepared! Car travel with your dog doesn’t have to be a hassle. It can even be fun!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for more PetHelpful updates?

(Another type of liver disease, alcohol-associated liver disease, is caused by drinking.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Both conditions are the result of the body storing too much fat in the liver, said Dr. Sobia Laique, a liver doctor and the director of the Multidisciplinary MASLD Clinic at Cleveland Clinic. In people with MASH, the excess fat has started to cause inflammation, which over time can lead to scarring, or fibrosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Left untreated, it can progress to liver failure and liver cancer, Laique said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease is more common in people with obesity or Type 2 diabetes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/liver-disease/nafld-nash/definition-facts" target="_blank"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. An estimated 75% of overweight people and more than 90% of people with obesity have the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There’s only one FDA-approved medication for MASH, called resmetirom, Laique said. However, the medication only helps about a quarter of patients and doesn’t address the underlying conditions that drive the disease. Bariatric surgery is often the recommended treatment for those who can’t resolve the condition through lifestyle changes, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“This is fairly monumental and really is going to be paradigm-changing,” Laique said of the Wegovy trial results, “because at least in the pharmacotherapy space, you don’t have a comparable drug yet.” She was not involved with the clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The trial, funded by drugmaker Novo Nordisk, included 800 patients with MASH from 37 countries. Patients either got a weekly 2.4 milligram dose of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, or a placebo, for 72 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The trial found that about 63% of patients in the semaglutide group saw a reduction in liver inflammation, compared with 34.3% of people who got a placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Prior to starting the trial, the participants also had moderate to high levels of scar tissue in the liver, known as stage 2 or 3 fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;About 37% of the semaglutide group saw improvements in their fibrosis, compared with 22.4% in the placebo group. The semaglutide group also saw other benefits, including a 10.5% average weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Susan Spratt, an endocrinologist and senior medical director for the Population Health Management Office at Duke Health in North Carolina who was not involved in the study, said she was impressed, noting that once fibrosis has developed in patients, it’s often difficult to reverse or treat the inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s incredibly good news that semaglutide not only reduced inflammation but also that fibrosis regressed,” Spratt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist who runs a weight loss clinic in Cary, North Carolina, said in an email that the results may offer hope for a condition with few treatment options, but added that long-term data is to determine whether the improvements from the drug will reduce liver-related complications and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“These findings represent a very promising step forward in the fight against a common, progressive, and often silent disease,” McGowan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The trial results add to the growing list of conditions that GLP-1s —  the class of drugs that includes Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound — can treat &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/beyond-ozempic-glp-1-drugs-promise-weight-loss-health-benefits-rcna157525" target="_blank"&gt;beyond diabetes and weight loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved Wegovy &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-wegovy-reduce-heart-attack-stroke-risk-rcna142534" target="_blank"&gt;to reduce heart disease risk&lt;/a&gt; in people with obesity. The agency also approved Zepbound for&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-weight-loss-drug-zepbound-sleep-apnea-rcna184916" target="_blank"&gt; obstructive sleep apnea &lt;/a&gt;in December, and Ozempic to &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fda-approves-ozempic-semaglutide-as-the-only-glp-1-ra-to-reduce-the-risk-of-worsening-kidney-disease-and-cardiovascular-death-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-and-chronic-kidney-disease-302362466.html" target="_blank"&gt;treat chronic kidney disease&lt;/a&gt; in patients with Type 2 diabetes in January. Researchers are also investigating whether the drugs are effective &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-may-protect-alzheimers-rcna163459" target="_blank"&gt;against Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ozempic-alcohol-addiction-latest-science-shows-rcna191015%20https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ozempic-alcohol-addiction-latest-science-shows-rcna191015%20https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ozempic-alcohol-addiction-latest-science-shows-rcna191015" target="_blank"&gt;alcohol addiction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Insurance companies are often reluctant to cover the drugs for weight; however, they’ve shown willingness to cover them when approved for other conditions, such as heart disease risk and sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In a release Wednesday, Novo Nordisk said the FDA could make a decision on whether to approve Wegovy for MASH as early as the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The FDA has granted the drug a priority review designation, the drugmaker said, meaning it will review the application in six months, rather than the standard nine-month window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Spratt noted that side effects can be a barrier for some who want to take Wegovy and similar weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The drug was well tolerated, according to the trial results. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, including nausea, diarrhea, constipation and vomiting. Side effects leading to people dropping out of the trial were 2.6% for the semaglutide group and 3.3% for the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Laique questioned whether patients would continue to see improvement after 72 weeks. She also noted that patients would likely have to continue taking the medication, or risk MASH coming back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“It’s significant weight loss, but then is it also durable weight loss?” she said. “And I think that’s the part people often forget about obesity management, it’s two battles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 21:04:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxPRS1lMUJXd3o0RmMtVm01d216Zm1rZGRqUW5hOGkyQTRXR0RBc2xHUG9QUXZHMmVWUlFBVzlCQ1dnZVdqYWoyS09aVzdiRmlTSzNkRTNIbGVoa2hvWkcxYUt3RUxiTnVxVWtFZ190VWF5QVp1RUVUV3A1d1FFTmcxVFl4RTNIcmcwVmhUWm9nZE1Od3lSQnZLZDFEU0NCYkQteUs0QlVORElRaENYVkpUUUlFOXRaNGPSAVZBVV95cUxOeDNwbll4ajdNVVZIOXpuQXZNOTAwOXFLZl9wTWtZRy1VSmw5a2cyLTlyUmRTXzF3MlJneXRHWGpOYl9fejRiMUhkVk1oR0oxS1RYempQZw</guid></item><item><title>长期COVID具有独特的症状，在流感，肺炎中未见持久性，研究表明- CIDRAP | Long COVID has unique symptoms, persistence not seen in flu, pneumonia, research suggests - CIDRAP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPZXRFNllicXNrOXEzOU9GX18tRHhpZ0JmUTg1Vk8yQVhNX2NveENnNWtjUU1DNHpaQmNGSzJMZDA3WkNUdkNFYUxnNW9iMnZUSnBqc1FrQWxGODFHVmItdlNXbHhxRlRWQWF3OV8zN3BRU0g5N0VsVHM4V3ZJa0VKZDdkTW1PdHNzVVJqLTZJblM2NlR5RjA5aVZFWTIxbzZ0cGhpUzhuS1FSOXlBZUxGSUZYNFJkZ3NReEFr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Post-COVID symptoms, prevalence, and time to resolution are different from those seen after flu or pneumonia, better characterizing long COVID, University of Texas investigators say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study team &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0322020"&gt;&lt;span&gt;analyzed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; health claims data from Medicare Advantage–covered and commercially insured US adults diagnosed as having symptomatic COVID-19 in 2020 (121,205 patients) and similar groups with flu (20,844) and pneumonia (29,052) diagnosed before the pandemic. Symptoms were evaluated 1, 3, and 6 months after post-diagnosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The findings were published yesterday in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;PLOS One&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over time, only most severe cases still caused symptoms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After 1, 3, and 6 months post-diagnosis, the odds ratios [ORs] of any symptom in the flu cohort relative to the COVID-19 group were 0.77, 0.77, and 0.68, respectively. In contrast, the respective ORs among pneumonia patients were 2.24, 2.41, and 2.46, meaning more than double the risk at those points in time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most common symptoms persisting beyond 4 weeks post-infection among COVID-19 patients were fatigue (25.4%), shortness of breath (24.7%), and joint pain (24.7%). Among flu patients, the most common symptoms were joint pain (19.8%), fatigue (18.2%), and cough (17.7%). In the pneumonia group, shortness of breath (42.2%), fatigue (34.8%), and cough (33.9%) were noted most often.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The odds of having any symptom didn't differ significantly between illness severity levels 4 and 3, but the ORs for severity levels 5, 6, 7, and 8 were 1.12, 1.16, 1.46, and 2.64 times those for severity level 3, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With increasing time since diagnosis, only the most severe infections (severity levels 7 and 8) continued to cause symptoms. For level 7, the OR of having a symptom versus level 3 was 1.19 and 1.10 after 3 and 6 months, respectively. Likewise, the level-8 OR was 1.84 and 1.53 at the same time points. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Underlying medical conditions resulted in higher odds for all time points and comorbidities. The chronic conditions with the greatest increased odds of symptoms after 4 weeks were rheumatoid arthritis (OR, 2.15), ischemic heart disease (OR, 1.80), and asthma (OR, 1.80).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Magnitude of odds waned, but trend persisted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Overall, relative to patients aged 80 and older, the odds of any symptom after 4 weeks were lower for all age-groups except for 70 to 79 years, which was not statistically different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We found differences in the prevalence of symptoms as well as different times to resolution better characterizing 'long COVID' and identifying that this persistence of symptoms is unique to COVID-19.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After controlling for demographic factors and chronic conditions, the likelihood of a diagnosis of anxiety, brain fog, fatigue, and shortness of breath after 1, 3, and 6 months rose along with COVID-19 severity. The probability of fatigue for severity level 8 after 4 weeks was 3.32 times that for level 3, and the OR of shortness of breath was 3.07. Over time, the magnitude of ORs ebbed but maintained the trend. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The northeastern United States saw the highest rates of all lingering COVID-19 symptoms, except for headache, for which it had the lowest rates. White patients were more likely to have anxiety or fatigue than their Asian, Black, and Hispanic peers. Hispanic patients were the least likely to have persistent abnormal heart rhythms, brain fog, and shortness of breath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We found that COVID-19 symptomology could not be perfectly described by previously seen influenza or pneumonia symptomology," the study authors concluded. "We found differences in the prevalence of symptoms as well as different times to resolution better characterizing 'long COVID' and identifying that this persistence of symptoms is unique to COVID-19."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;Fitzgerald said &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/introduction-to-menopause" target="_blank"&gt;hot flashes are one of the most commonly reported symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of perimenopause and menopause. "A hot flush or flash is caused by hormonal fluctuations, particularly changes in estrogen levels. During perimenopause, estrogen levels fluctuate much like a rollercoaster, which can lead to temperature dysregulation and trigger hot flashes.

&lt;p&gt;Irregular periods and night sweats are other &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/perimenopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20354666" target="_blank"&gt;common symptoms of perimenopause&lt;/a&gt; and menopause.

Other symptoms include brain fog, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed, joint aches and pains, muscle pain, dry eyes or hair, tinnitus, vaginal dryness, rescues libido, weight gain, reduced energy levels," Fitzgerald said, adding that people may experience all, some, or none of these symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

"A hot flush or flash is caused by hormonal fluctuations, particularly changes in estrogen levels.

After menopause, when there is a steep decline in estrogen levels, hot flashes often continue but may become less frequent over time," she explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Irregular periods and night sweats are other &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/perimenopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20354666" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:common symptoms of perimenopause;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;common symptoms of perimenopause&lt;/a&gt; and menopause.

Other symptoms include brain fog, anxiety, feeling overwhelmed, joint aches and pains, muscle pain, dry eyes or hair, tinnitus, vaginal dryness, rescues libido, weight gain, reduced energy levels," Fitzgerald said, adding that people may experience all, some, or none of these symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to the lesser-known symptoms shared by the TikTokers above, people may also experience &lt;a href="https://myacare.com/blog/12-perimenopause-symptoms-that-no-one-talks-about-and-how-to-deal-with-them" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:burning mouth syndrome, nipple discharge, and hormonal acne;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;burning mouth syndrome, nipple discharge, and hormonal acne&lt;/a&gt;. Fitzgerald said Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is one of the most effective options when it comes to helping stabilize estrogen levels to diminish symptoms like hot flashes.

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The groundbreaking move offered a rare and powerful opportunity to see dementia developing in human brain cells. Experts said the new way of studying the disease could make it easier to test new drugs and boost the chances of finding ones that work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dementia presents a big threat to health and social care systems across the world. The number of people affected is forecast to triple to nearly 153 million by 2050, which underlines why finding new ways to study the disease and speed up the search for treatments is a health priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the study, scientists and neurosurgeons in Edinburgh teamed up to show for the first time how a toxic form of a protein linked to Alzheimer’s, amyloid beta, can stick to and destroy vital connections between brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Tiny fragments of healthy brain tissue were collected from cancer patients while they were undergoing routine surgery to remove tumours at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8b8c69be-6cd6-43cb-a6e9-4944996e5fa2" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Living brain tissue cultures are placed inside an incubator set at 37C to mimic body temperature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Scientists dressed in scrubs were stationed in operating theatres alongside surgical teams, ready to receive the healthy brain tissue, which would otherwise have been discarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Once the pieces of brain were retrieved, scientists put them in glass bottles filled with oxygenated artificial spinal fluid before jumping into taxis to transport the samples to their lab a few minutes away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We pretty much ran back to the lab,” said Dr Claire Durrant, a Race Against Dementia fellow and UK Dementia Research Institute emerging leader at the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There, samples were sliced into thin pieces, less than a third of a millimetre thick, and laid out in small dishes. Each piece of living brain tissue was kept in a nutrient-rich liquid, inside an incubator at 37C to mimic body temperature. “And then we start experiments almost straight away,” Durrant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Fragments of human brain were kept alive in dishes for up to a fortnight, with the patient’s permission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers extracted the toxic form of amyloid beta from people who died from Alzheimer’s disease and then applied it to the healthy living brain tissue in their dishes. “We’re trying to mimic Alzheimer’s disease,” said Durrant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="24dbd054-ad95-4f99-a061-759dc717918c" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;From left: Dr Claire Durrant, Sir James Dyson and Sir Jackie Stewart.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Douglas Robertson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Unlike when exposed to a normal form of the protein, the brain did not attempt to repair damage caused by the toxic form of amyloid beta, her team found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Even small changes in natural levels of amyloid beta – increasing or decreasing – were enough to disrupt brain cells. This suggests that the brain requires a finely tuned sweet spot of the protein to function properly, Durrant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Working alongside the neurosurgical team at the University of Edinburgh, we have shown that living human brain slices can be used to explore fundamental questions relating to Alzheimer’s disease,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-17" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"morning-briefing","successDescription":"Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Alzheimer’s attacks synapses and their loss strongly predicts reduced memory and thinking abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Durrant’s team also found that brain slices taken from the temporal lobe, a region known to be affected early in Alzheimer’s, released higher levels of tau, another key disease protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This may explain why this part of the brain is particularly vulnerable in early Alzheimer’s, as increased tau release may enable toxic forms of this protein to spread faster between cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The research was backed by Race Against Dementia, a charity formed by Sir Jackie Stewart after his wife’s dementia diagnosis, and a £1m donation from the James Dyson Foundation, a charity supporting medical research and engineering education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dyson said the breakthrough represented progress “towards solving one of the most devastating problems of our time”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Working with brain surgeons and their consenting patients to collect samples of living human brain and keep them alive in the lab is a groundbreaking method,” he said. “It allows researchers to better examine Alzheimer’s disease on real human brain cells rather than relying on animal substitutes, such as mice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Tara Spires-Jones, group leader at the UK Dementia Research Institute, hailed the important development. Seeing early Alzheimer’s in real-time provided a new tool for scientists to better understand the disease and how to treat it, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She said: “The use of living human tissue samples generously donated by people undergoing surgery to remove brain tumours allows scientists to probe how living human brain reacts to toxic proteins produced in Alzheimer’s, and in future will allow testing of whether new treatments are effective in human brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 19:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNVEFxT2NpaWRVWm5GM3BwWFU0Z21lYnBfcTFQY0l4bjM1d01JbGZUQXFHQi1sVXA5eEdvRktoRkYxWkg1Q24yZDJySzA0UzBHNEpDZmVIZDJvYzlkTXo0MGttWkhBdjQ0bndwYnZ1dkpPbEZ0dnZneEZzNW5HaWxOenFBZVd4UjdDandkNXhtLWZ0Q0dDUlpydDNuN2FiU3F1ank4QWpLdWlfalFUU2MweC1TUHpIUE95Q0E</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，常见的家用塑料与全球数千人死于心脏病有关- CNN | Common household plastics linked to thousands of global deaths from heart disease, study finds - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQTWtrT043aFd4S3ROLW9pc3N2UEJ1Z0U3WVdMUnhSWHhPd2VGLVVTVUtHMXQ1bldzMlpoblpWbmdWRS13cGZ4N2ZJOWdzUGsxQVRON0F4XzVOVHFnS0tqMlItWG5NcEdtbVhaSjdFdmhuQXk5dThZeXpFRkIwdGZUblBDSXdLNDAzTWtoTGF4UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Synthetic chemicals called phthalates, found in consumer products such as food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children’s toys, may have contributed to more than 10% of all global mortality from heart disease in 2018 among men and women ages 55 through 64, a new study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000e3b6mzf1pjf4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Phthalates contribute to inflammation and systemic inflammation in the coronary arteries, which can accelerate existing disease and lead to acute events including mortality,” said senior author Dr. Leonardo Trasande, a professor of pediatrics and population health at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine. He also is director of NYU Langone’s Division of Environmental Pediatrics and Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Phthalates are known to disrupt testosterone,” Trasande said, adding that in men, “low testosterone is a predictor of adult cardiovascular disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000g3b6m03ieospc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Phthalates have been linked in earlier studies with &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.2478/s13382-011-0022-2" target="_blank"&gt;reproductive problems&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27567446/" target="_blank"&gt;genital malformations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1280383/" target="_blank"&gt;undescended testes &lt;/a&gt;in baby boys and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27546318/#:~:text=The%20general%20exposure%20to%20endocrine,malformations%20of%20the%20genital%20tract." target="_blank"&gt;lower sperm counts&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7067547/" target="_blank"&gt; testosterone levels &lt;/a&gt;in adult males. Studies have also linked phthalates to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1247566/" target="_blank"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3385443/" target="_blank"&gt;childhood obesity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273230099912965" target="_blank"&gt;cancer.&lt;/a&gt;

            “The new study underscores the potentially enormous health and economic burden of DEHP exposure, which aligns with existing concerns about its risks,” said David Andrews, acting chief science officer at the Environmental Working Group, a consumer organization that monitors exposure to phthalates and other chemicals in plastics, in an email. He was not involved with the study.

            The American Chemistry Council, which represents industry, declined to comment on the study but told CNN via email that the organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.americanchemistry.com/industry-groups/high-phthalates" target="_blank"&gt;High Phthalates Panel&lt;/a&gt; is dedicated to promoting the benefits of high phthalates such as DINP and DIDP.

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000j3b6mfno0kpmh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Often called “&lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/sites/default/files/research/supported/translational/peph/resources/assets/docs/phthalates_the_everywhere_chemical_zero_breast_cancer_508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;everywhere chemicals&lt;/a&gt;” because they are so common, phthalates are added to consumer products such as PVC plumbing pipes, vinyl flooring, rain- and stain-resistant products, medical tubing, garden hoses and some children’s toys to make the plastic more flexible and harder to break.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Other common exposures come from the use of phthalates in food packaging, detergents, clothing, furniture and automotive plastics. &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/phthalates-cosmetics" target="_blank"&gt;Phthalates&lt;/a&gt; are also added to personal care items such as shampoo, soap, hair spray and cosmetics to make fragrances last longer.&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/30/health/shopping-toxic-chemicals-wellness/index.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

            People are exposed when they breathe contaminated air or eat or drink foods that come into contact with the plastic, according to the &lt;a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=377&amp;amp;toxid=65" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The new study, &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105730" target="_blank"&gt;published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal eBiomedicine, examined the impact of one phthalate — &lt;a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=377&amp;amp;toxid=65" target="_blank"&gt;Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate&lt;/a&gt;, or DEHP — on global deaths across 200 countries and territories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000n3b6m610vnucu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers analyzed health and environmental data from dozens of population surveys, which included urine samples containing chemical breakdown products left by DEHP, which is known to be connected to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7570088/#:~:text=The%20authors%20found%20a%20positive,subclinical%20atherosclerosis%2C%20enhancing%20the%20risk" target="_blank"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, Trasande said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000o3b6mqoh2ib40@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate has also been linked to birth defects, cancer and reproductive harm for men, according to California’s &lt;a href="https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/di2-ethylhexylphthalate-dehp" target="_blank"&gt;Proposition 65&lt;/a&gt;, a law that requires companies to place warning labels on products notifying consumers about chemicals’ possible health effects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000p3b6mdnfg65k6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers compared the exposure with death statistics collected by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a US research group that gathers global medical information.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000q3b6mrvx58kr5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The analysis found exposure to DEHP contributed to 356,238 deaths in 2018 among men and women ages 55 through 64 globally. Africa accounted for 30% of the deaths from heart disease linked to DEHP, while East Asia and the Middle East accounted for 25% of the mortality, the study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000r3b6mm1bfdioa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research is believed to be the first global estimate of any health outcome from exposure to the DEHP, said lead study author Sara Hyman, an associate research scientist at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000s3b6mv63u81ug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “By highlighting the connection between phthalates and a leading cause of death across the world, our findings add to the vast body of evidence that these chemicals present a tremendous danger to human health,” Hyman said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000t3b6mllcyynix@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A limitation of the research, however, stems from the use of hazard ratios the US to estimate population-attributable deaths in other countries, EWG’s Andrews said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000u3b6m0fj7a2zw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While the authors acknowledge this limitation, it assumes that the relationship between DEHP exposure and cardiovascular disease is consistent globally,” he said in an email. “This may not hold true given significant differences in both exposure levels and access to CVD detection and treatment across countries.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000v3b6mxpdd7sf0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/12/health/plastic-chemical-early-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; by Trasande and his team measured the urine concentration of phthalates in more than 5,000 adults in the United States and compared those levels with the risk of early death over an average of 10 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000w3b6mhoxmte59@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749121016031?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers found phthalates may contribute to some 91,000 to 107,000 premature deaths a year among Americans ages 55 to 64&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;People with the highest levels of phthalates had a greater risk of death from any cause, especially cardiovascular mortality, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000x3b6m6tpd1c9u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The results held even after researchers controlled for preexisting heart disease, diabetes, cancer and other common conditions, poor eating habits, physical activity and body mass, and levels of other known &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/17/health/bpa-bisphenol-a-plastics-canned-foods-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;hormone disruptors such as bisphenol A or BPA&lt;/a&gt;.

            Researchers estimated those deaths could cost the United States about $40 billion to $47 billion each year in lost economic productivity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            It is possible to minimize your exposure to phthalates and other endocrine disruptors, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc00103b6m15pm0pdc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Avoid plastics as much as you can. Reducing your use of ultraprocessed foods can reduce the levels of the chemical exposures you come in contact with,” Trasande said. “Never put plastic containers in the microwave or dishwasher, where the heat can break down the linings so they might be absorbed more readily.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc00113b6mev2owgaz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            ·       Avoid air fresheners and all plastics labeled as No. 3, No. 6 and No. 7.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care workers who wash their uniforms at home may be unknowingly contributing to the spread of antibiotic-resistant infections in hospitals, according to a new study led by Katie Laird of De Montfort University, &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0321467&amp;amp;utm_source=pr&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=plos006" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;PLOS One.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Hospital-acquired infections are a major public health concern, in part because they frequently involve antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Many nurses and health care workers clean their uniforms at home in standard washing machines, but some studies have found that bacteria can be transmitted through clothing, raising the question of whether these machines can sufficiently prevent the spread of dangerous microbes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers evaluated whether six models of home washing machine successfully decontaminated health care worker uniforms, by washing contaminated fabric swatches in hot water, using a rapid or normal cycle. Half of the machines did not disinfect the clothing during a rapid cycle, while one-third failed to clean sufficiently during the standard cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also sampled biofilms from inside 12 washing machines. DNA sequencing revealed the presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/antibiotic+resistance+genes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;antibiotic resistance genes&lt;/a&gt;. Investigations also showed that bacteria can develop resistance to domestic detergent, which also increases their resistance to certain antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, the findings suggest that many home washing machines may be insufficient for decontaminating health care worker uniforms, and may be contributing to the spread of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hospital/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt;-acquired infections and antibiotic resistance. The researchers propose that the laundering guidelines given to health care workers should be revised to ensure that home washing machines are cleaning effectively. Alternatively, health care facilities could use on-site industrial machines to launder uniforms to improve &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/patient+safety/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;patient safety&lt;/a&gt; and control the spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors add, "Our research shows that domestic washing machines often fail to disinfect textiles, allowing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/antibiotic-resistant+bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;antibiotic-resistant bacteria&lt;/a&gt; to survive. If we're serious about the transmission of infectious disease via textiles and tackling antimicrobial resistance, we must rethink how we launder what our &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+care+workers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health care workers&lt;/a&gt; wear."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression, schizophrenia and other mental health conditions affect 1 in 4 people in their lifetime, but the mechanisms underlying these conditions are poorly understood. New research led by researchers at the University of Bristol has linked the body's immune response with schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, depression, and bipolar disorder. The study demonstrates mental health conditions might be affected by the whole body as well as changes in the brain. The findings could pave the way for better treatments of some mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The work &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03032-x" target="_blank"&gt;appears&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people with depression or &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/schizophrenia/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; are treated with drugs that work on brain chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine. However, one in three people with these conditions do not benefit from these treatments, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Dr. Christina Dardani and Professor Golam Khandaker in Bristol's MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU), used Mendelian randomization—a computational approach that uses &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+information/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic information&lt;/a&gt; from large datasets—to examine whether immunological proteins are likely to be involved in seven neuropsychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team looked at the relationship of 735 immune response-related proteins measurable in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+blood/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human blood&lt;/a&gt; with depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bipolar+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;, Alzheimer's disease, autism, and ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found a potential causal role of 29 immune response-related proteins in these seven neuropsychiatric conditions. From the identified biomarkers, 20 showed potential as targets of drugs approved for other conditions. These biomarkers could potentially be used in the future for novel therapeutics in the area of mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The findings suggest a fundamental change in the understanding of causal mechanisms for neuropsychiatric conditions. To date, causal explanations for depression and schizophrenia have been predicted by monoamine neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, but this study suggests that overactivity of the immune system could also contribute to the cause of mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golam Khandaker, Professor of Psychiatry and Immunology and MRC Investigator in the Bristol Medical School: Population Health Sciences (PHS), said, "Our study demonstrates that inflammation in the brain and the body might influence the risk of mental health conditions. The findings challenge the centuries-old Cartesian dichotomy between the body and the mind, and suggest that we should consider &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/depression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and schizophrenia as conditions affecting the whole person."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to examine biomarkers identified through &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+analysis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic analysis&lt;/a&gt; using other methods. This includes research based on health records, animal studies, and proof-of-concept &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; in humans, to further evaluate causality; understand precise mechanisms from inflammation to symptoms of mental health conditions; and learn more about therapeutic potential, including whether modulating immune pathways improves symptoms of these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

            More U.S. women died around the time of childbirth last year, reversing two years of decline, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/provisional-maternal-deaths-rates.htm" target="_blank"&gt;provisional data&lt;/a&gt; posted Wednesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 688 people died last year during pregnancy or shortly after giving birth. That’s up from 669 deaths in 2023, but down from 2022 and 2021, when it was the highest level in more than 50 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The maternal mortality rate rose to 19 deaths per 100,000 live births, up from 18.6 the year before.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The CDC counts women who die while pregnant, during childbirth and up to 42 days after birth from conditions related to pregnancy. Excessive bleeding, blood vessel blockages and infections are &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/maternal-mortality-healthy-start-oklahoma-california-new-york-city-0aa1fa2a141ef82607026b384cc14af7" target="_blank"&gt;leading causes&lt;/a&gt;.

            Such deaths spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the coronavirus was particularly dangerous to pregnant women. And, in the worst days of the pandemic, burned out physicians may have added to the risk by ignoring pregnant women’s worries, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma49cdz700093b6mj31ezdqt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The waning of COVID-19 is considered a major reason for the declines in maternal deaths in 2022 and 2023, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma49cdz7000a3b6mlyfzaz4e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But those improvements are now being offset by other factors that may reduce access to medical care, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pregnancy-deaths-cdc-maternal-mortality-fbb4950245b517b4f4d57517b62556d9" target="_blank"&gt;experts say&lt;/a&gt;. They say the list includes the closure of rural hospitals and the U.S. Supreme Court decision that did away with the federally established right to abortion, which caused some doctors to feel constrained about providing care during pregnancy-related medical emergencies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma49cdz7000b3b6meh4zkp5b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The U.S. has one of &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/maternal-mortality-rates-us-europe-norway-56829d76f4469c2fd48761ed922d13e4" target="_blank"&gt;the highest&lt;/a&gt; maternal mortality rate among wealthy nations. Past research has found &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/black-maternal-mortality-american-indian-hispanic-deaths-64da18fec80f8f1790aee2e9986a757e" target="_blank"&gt;wide racial disparities&lt;/a&gt; in such deaths, with Black women dying &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/maternal-mortality-deaths-black-white-1755a7d1b51d2098326fd651af9bb1ef" target="_blank"&gt;at a far higher rate&lt;/a&gt; than white women.

&lt;p&gt;When Briana Galvan said goodbye to her father on the morning of March 16, 2024, she left the hospital to run errands, comforted by the fact that he was recovering.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Westrum, 80, had recently suffered a stroke and had been admitted to M Health Fairview Southdale with shortness of breath and pneumonia just four days earlier. But his condition had improved enough that he had been moved to a step-down unit while awaiting transfer to a nursing home. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just hours later, Briana received a call to come back to the hospital. When she arrived, she was not allowed into her father’s room and was directed to the chapel. There, she was told her father was dead. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was unbelievable,” Briana said, “based on the condition that I saw him in that morning.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briana said the hospital told her that Steven had suffered external bleeding but offered no further details.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They said he had bled externally, but they were not aware of what had happened yet, that they would need to do some investigation and look into it,” she said.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two months, she was left without answers. Then came the autopsy. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Steven Westrum’s death did not seem connected to an intentional act, records show the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office declined to do a forensic autopsy.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That left the autopsy, which Briana said she wanted done, to be completed by the M Health Fairview system. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the hospital autopsy was completed in May 2024, Briana says she was contacted to set up a meeting to discuss the results. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briana, who works in risk management, told KARE 11 she was suspicious because of the lack of answers she’d received to date, so she and her husband decided to secretly record the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business cards handed to Briana by the two hospital representatives in attendance show she met with Dr. Dan Frechette, Fairview Health Services' vice president of medical affairs at Ridges and Southdale hospitals, along with VP Adam Karlen, Fairview’s chief nursing officer. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this case, a bleeding event may have contributed, and so it is our responsibility to be transparent about that,” one of the men can be heard telling Briana in the recording, “and also to do what we can to try to address it from happening in the future.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hospital executives explained that Steven’s IV catheter had become disconnected at some point in the afternoon, they weren’t sure when or how, and that uncapped catheter — which did not have backflow prevention — was the source of what they labeled “the bleeding event.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They called the event “extremely rare” but also downplayed the known role it played in Steven’s death.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it's just so difficult to know what the impact of that was,” one of the hospital representatives said.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can't say definitively that this caused your father's death,” Briana was told in the recording. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M Health Fairview’s autopsy results also offered few answers, but one important clue. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="longform__chapter longform__chapter_featured-state_collapsed" id="longform_chapter_2"&gt;
            &lt;h2 class="longform__chapter-heading"&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-number"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="longform__chapter-heading-separator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-title"&gt; A Natural Death&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The M Health Fairview autopsy on the body of Steven Westrum was conducted by pathologists at the University of Minnesota Medical Center. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first page, the anatomic cause of death is listed as “Not Identified.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of significant contributory conditions are listed, including severe coronary artery disease, hypertension and pneumonia.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood loss is not among the contributing conditions listed. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on page five, under the “Clinical Information” section, there is a notation that for Briana, screams off the page. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s like reading a horror story,” she said while looking at the document. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notation reads, “He was found with an uncapped IV catheter in his arm and was lying in a pool of blood that was congealed at the edges.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the clinical finding that Steven lost so much blood it pooled beneath him, pathologists wrote, “multiple medical conditions were identified at autopsy, and correlated with clinical information, that may have contributed to his death.”  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They concluded, “Taken together, these findings do not point to an acute or specific cause of death.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The autopsy listed Steven’s manner of death as “Natural.”&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="longform__chapter longform__chapter_featured-state_collapsed" id="longform_chapter_3"&gt;
            &lt;h2 class="longform__chapter-heading"&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-number"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="longform__chapter-heading-separator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-title"&gt; The Death Certificate&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days after she met with the hospital executives, on May 30, 2024, Briana received another call, this time from the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This call would completely change her understanding of her father’s death. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ME’s office was preparing her father’s death certificate and wanted to go over the case and the wording. Briana was told the official cause of death was exsanguination — a severe loss of blood — due to a catheter mishap. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briana was told for the first time that her father did not die from a natural combination of his underlying health conditions. She, instead, was told he conclusively bled to death in his hospital bed.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unbelievable, unbelievable,” she said. “There’s nothing natural about this, nothing!” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike what Briana had been told by M Health Fairview, records kept by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner show their investigator was immediately informed by the hospital on the day Steven died that he had “exsanguinated … due to an uncapped IV.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ME investigator's narrative shows that Dr. Christopher Aronson with Fairview Southdale Hospital called the ME’s office on March 16, 2024, to report the death. He said that “a lab tech went into the decedent’s room to draw blood and found the decedent unresponsive with a pool of blood on the floor next to his bed.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was estimated that Steven had lost “about 4 liters of blood.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internal hospital notes later obtained by Briana show staff wrote, “There was a large amount of blood on the left side of the patient's body and a large pool of blood underneath the patient's bed, which was apparently congealed at the edges and dried (did not wet the tip of glove).” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="longform__chapter longform__chapter_featured-state_collapsed" id="longform_chapter_4"&gt;
            &lt;h2 class="longform__chapter-heading"&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-number"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="longform__chapter-heading-separator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-title"&gt; 'Smacks of protectionism'&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The human body only holds about five liters of blood,” says Dr. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist who previously served as the president of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At KARE 11’s request, Dr. Weedn reviewed all of the hospital medical and autopsy records, along with the ME’s reports. He said in his opinion the autopsy “smacks of protectionism of the hospital.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s significant when you see that four liters of blood was lost?” KARE 11 asked. &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, yes,” Weedn responded, “Four liters of blood is clearly a lethal event. There is absolutely no mystery about what caused Mr. Westrum’s death. He definitely died from blood loss.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Briana has since hired attorney Jeff Montpetit and is preparing to file a medical malpractice lawsuit against M Health Fairview. Montpetit called the case “the most deviant thing I have ever seen in my history as a lawyer.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                    
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="longform__chapter longform__chapter_featured-state_collapsed" id="longform_chapter_5"&gt;
            &lt;h2 class="longform__chapter-heading"&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-number"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="longform__chapter-heading-separator"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="longform__chapter-title"&gt; A Mistake&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/h2&gt;

                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to KARE 11’s investigation, M Health Fairview declined an interview.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, after repeated questioning by KARE 11 about the details of its autopsy, the hospital system did an about-face. It admitted it was a mistake for the manner of death to have been listed as “natural.” The hospital system also pledged it would be changed to "Accidental."&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KARE 11 made the editorial decision to publish their lengthy statement in full: &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are deeply saddened by the passing of Mr. Westrum and regret the circumstances surrounding his death. While adverse events are rare, we recognize that even one is too many. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We want to be clear: our care team communicated with Mr. Westrum’s family about the IV catheter disconnection and visible bleeding following the incident. These details were documented in the medical record, discussed with the family, included in the hospital’s autopsy narrative, and reported to regulatory bodies. We take every incident seriously, and this highly unusual complication was no exception. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hospital autopsy report listed the cause of death as “not identified” and the manner of death as “natural.” After further review, we acknowledge that this classification may not fully reflect the circumstances surrounding the event. Based on the clinical context, a classification of “undetermined” or “accidental" may have been more appropriate. The classification in the autopsy report had no bearing on our response to this incident. It did not impact our disclosure process with the family, reporting it through appropriate oversight and safety reporting channels, or our extensive analysis of the event and corrective action plans developed. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was not an attempt to mislead or conceal what occurred. Rather, it reflects the reality that over 95% of hospital deaths are classified as natural, while non-natural classifications are uncommon. Our chief of pathology has reviewed this case and will share additional training and process updates across the pathology team as part of our ongoing commitment to transparency, learning, and patient safety. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Westrum wanted his ashes spread in a place he loved to visit: Copper Harbor, Michigan.  &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summer, Briana plans to honor that wish, embarking on a final journey with her father, who, even at 80 years old and in failing health, she believes died too soon.&lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div class="longform__element longform__element_type_text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He bled out externally — almost all the blood in his body over a period of time,” she said, “and no accountability for that.” &lt;/p&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;
                
                    
        &lt;/section&gt;

lucid dreaming&lt;/a&gt; is more than just a vivid sleep state, it's actually a whole other state of consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucid dreaming occurs when a person becomes aware they are dreaming, often gaining the ability to control the dream’s events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For instance, they might fly, walk through walls, or confront fears, taking advantage of the limitless possibilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously, scientists believed lucid dreams were simply more vivid or intense versions of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14078587/dreams-scientist-bizarre-sleep-paralysis-lucid.html"&gt;the typical dreams that occur during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep&lt;/a&gt;, which is a normal phase of the sleep cycle characterized by increased brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this new study shows that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14590121/Jaw-dropping-scan-shows-mouse-brain-youve-never-seen-before.html"&gt;brain activity patterns&lt;/a&gt; during a lucid dream are entirely different from those that occur during regular dreams and wakefulness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These patterns reflect changes in how brain regions activate and communicate, linked to shifts in perception, memory, self-awareness, and cognitive control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, they found that lucid dreaming was associated with reduced beta brain waves (which are linked to waking consciousness and alertness) in two different brain regions that control spatial awareness, sense of touch and self-perception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, gamma waves, which indicate heightened focus and consciousness, increased in the medial prefrontal cortex, a region involved in self-referential thinking and metacognition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These findings suggest lucid dreaming is a unique neural state, offering new insights into consciousness and potential applications in therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers have discovered that lucid dreaming is more than just a vivid sleep state, it's actually a whole other state of consciousness &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This research opens the door to a deeper understanding of lucid dreaming as an intricate state of consciousness by pointing to the possibility that conscious experience can arise from within sleep itself,' said lead researcher Çağatay Demirel, of Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This work offers a perspective that could challenge the traditional binary view of sleep and wakefulness in future research,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Demirel and his colleagues compiled an enormous amount of data from previous sleep studies — which measured brain activity with EEGs — into what they believe is now the largest dataset in this field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They then compared brain activity patterns for wakefulness, REM sleep and lucid dreaming to determine what makes each state unique. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the surface level, brain activity during lucid dreaming did not look all that different from REM sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when the researchers dove deeper to look at the sources of electrical signals in the brain, key differences began to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The reduction in beta waves associated with lucid dreaming was isolated to the right temporal lobe (which controls spatial awareness and nonverbal memory) and the parietal lobe (which controls the senses and self-perception).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beta waves are high-frequency brain waves that are typically associated with a wakeful state. They are involved in conscious thought and logical thinking, and tend to have a stimulating effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lucid dreams are dreams where the dreamer is aware they are dreaming and can sometimes control what happens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers suggest that this reduction could signal the brain's process of recognizing that the dream is not real, thereby allowing the dreamer to become aware that they are dreaming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found an increase in gamma waves in the right precuneus, which plays an important role in spatially guided behavior and imagining one's own actions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This surge of gamma activity coincided with the moment the dreamer realizes they are dreaming, suggesting that it may further reflect the brain's process of becoming lucid while sleeping.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded that these patterns of brain activity are totally unique to lucid dreaming, indicating that it is its own state of consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But perhaps more interestingly, they also found that these patterns are most similar to the brain activity associated with the effects of psychedelic drugs such as LSD and ayahuasca. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like lucid dreams, these psychedelic experiences are also associated with activity changes in the precuneus, according to the researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But 'While psychedelics often lead to a dissolution of ego and decreased self-referential processing . . . lucid dreams may actually harness elements of self-awareness &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and control,' Demirel they wrote in their report.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team published their findings in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2025/03/27/JNEUROSCI.2237-24.2025"&gt;The Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lucid dreams can occur spontaneously, but you can also train yourself to have them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers have identified several techniques that can help you induce a lucid dream. But the Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams, also known as the 'MILD' technique, is among the most effective, according to &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/dreams/lucid-dreams"&gt;SleepFoundation.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's designed to be used when you wake up in the middle of the night, and involves four basic steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, upon awakening, try to recall what you have been dreaming about or the details of a dream you just had that you'd like to reenter.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, identify signs from the dream that will help you realize that you're dreaming once you reenter it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Say the words: 'When I begin dreaming, I will remember that I'm dreaming.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then continue recalling the dream content and repeating that phrase until you fall back asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This technique is more effective for some people than others, but it tends to result in lucid dreaming 20 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 17:37:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>年轻人的肠癌发病率正在上升-《经济学人》 | Rates of bowel cancer are rising among young people - The Economist</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxPUzlvRjZHa2xQRi1DNkd5YkJtdDRYcXNZdmstR3pHX0RNekgtLU5VUlBzWkN1clMtN21ETENpbGJ1NDFzVjBJSHU2RVRXdjRmcHBCcVB1aFY1MllvSnFDeXhhSnNMcFlYX0czRTdsd29jb3prYW5IeG1MRGg4bzQ5TmhXYkoza2tyclZoam5rSTdPNklSMERHcHlBcGlKb3M0VG5MclNud09hcmdBR0JSSg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-p6fe6o efq1yh21"&gt;&lt;p data-component="paragraph" class="css-1l5amll e1y9q0ei0"&gt;&lt;span data-caps="initial"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;small&gt;T EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS&lt;/small&gt; across the world, patients are presenting with undiagnosed cancers at an advanced stage.

Two key neuromodulators, serotonin and neurotensin, were found to control opposing emotional responses in a brain region responsible for learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a mouse model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), activating serotonin receptors restored the ability to form positive impressions from social interactions. The findings could pave the way for therapies that target emotional imbalances in disorders like ASD and schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Tagging:&lt;/strong&gt; Serotonin and neurotensin in the hippocampus determine whether a social interaction feels positive or negative.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversing Deficits:&lt;/strong&gt; Stimulating serotonin 1B receptors restored positive social impressions in a mouse model of ASD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; The study reveals specific neuromodulatory targets that could inform future treatments for social cognitive deficits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mount Sinai researchers have identified for the first time the neural mechanisms in the brain that regulate both positive and negative impressions of a social encounter, as well as how an imbalance between the two could lead to common neuropsychiatric disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published April 30 in &lt;em&gt;Nature,&lt;/em&gt; also describes how activating a serotonin receptor in the brain of a mouse model of ASD restored positive emotional value (also known as “valence”), with encouraging implications for the development of future therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109394"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-situations-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-situations-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-situations-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-situations-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-situations-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-situations-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-situations-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-situations-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two heads and brains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-situations-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-situations-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-situations-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-situations-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-situations-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-situations-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/social-situations-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While deficits in social valence are known to be prevalent in many neuropsychiatric disorders, their underlying neural mechanisms and pathophysiology have remained elusive. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ability to recognize and distinguish unpleasant from pleasant interactions is essential for humans to navigate their social environment,” says Xiaoting Wu, PhD, Assistant Professor of Neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Until now, it has been unclear how the brain assigns positivity or negativity—‘valence’—to social experiences, and how that information can be flexibly updated in a constantly changing environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the center of this complex neural circuitry is the hippocampus, located deep in the temporal lobe of the brain and responsible for forming new memories, learning, and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mount Sinai researchers described how two neuromodulators—serotonin and neurotensin, which influence processes such as mood, arousal, and neural plasticity—are released into the hippocampal subregion known as ventral CA1, where they control opposing social valence assignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both neurotransmitters impact distinct populations of ventral CA1 neurons through their respective receptors, serotonin 1B and neurotensin 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While deficits in social valence are known to be prevalent in many neuropsychiatric disorders, their underlying neural mechanisms and pathophysiology have remained elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Through our work we’ve provided the first foundational insights into the neural basis of social valence,” notes Dr. Wu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have demonstrated that the neuromodulators serotonin and neurotensin signal opposing valence, revealing a fundamental principle of brain function in the form of a neuromodulatory switch that allows behavioral adaptation based on social history.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the team developed a novel social cognitive paradigm that involved exposing mice to negative and positive social encounters. In the negative social encounter, the test mouse was exposed to a mean/aggressive mouse; in the positive encounter, the mouse was exposed to a potential mate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both assays the mice had negative or neutral/positive or neutral interaction and then got to choose which mouse they would like to spend more time with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without prior experience, the mice did not have a preference, but with the experience, they associated a mouse with a positive or negative valence and then learned to avoid the “bad” mouse or approach the “good” mouse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as importantly, the team uncovered specific drug targets for positive and negative valence, knowledge that could potentially factor into future treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, serotonin acting on the serotonin 1B receptor generates a positive impression of a social encounter, while neurotensin acting on the neurotensin 1 receptor creates a negative impression. Imbalanced emotional processing of those two social experiences is known to be a debilitating symptom of ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, by activating the serotonin 1B receptor, researchers were able to restore a positive impression associated with rewarding social experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We identified a specific neuromodulator receptor which we then targeted to rescue social cognitive deficits in a mouse model of ASD,” Dr. Wu explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On a broader scale, our work provides critical insights into complex social behaviors while revealing potential therapeutic targets that can be leveraged to improve social cognitive deficits in common neuropsychiatric disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by funding from NIH K99 Career Development Award (grant no.

The study highlights how endurance training and fitness influence inflammation, blood flow, and brain plasticity—key factors in cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, short bouts of brisk activity, like walking too fast to sing, can lower dementia risk by up to 40%. Researchers stress it’s never too late to start, urging health guidelines to reflect the brain-boosting power of microtraining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Intensity, Low-Dose:&lt;/strong&gt; Even small doses of vigorous exercise can protect the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Short bursts of intense activity may reduce dementia risk by up to 40%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Exercise boosts blood flow, reduces inflammation, and enhances brain plasticity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;NTNU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The news that even small amounts of physical activity can provide major health benefits received a lot of attention in Norway when NTNU researchers Ulrik Wisløff and Atefe R. Tari published their book “Microtraining – 7 weeks to boost fitness and strength” in January this year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the same researchers have looked at the connection between physical activity, or being in good physical shape, and brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109390"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging.jpg" alt="This shows a woman running and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-brain-aging-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers point out that exercising much less than what the current recommendations recommend can provide great benefits – as long as the intensity of the training is high. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was conducted with colleagues from the Queensland Brain Institute in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Promising measures&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which has been published in the British medical journal The Lancet, shows that the brain definitely benefits from physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even small amounts of high intensity exercise have an effect on the brain. This should be communicated more clearly – it may be what motivates people to get started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endurance training and good fitness can reduce the risk of dementia and promote healthy brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;” And it is never too late to start,” says Atefe R. Tari, the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even small amounts of physical activity may be enough to protect the aging brain, the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We summarize research that clearly indicates that exercise is not only important for the heart, but also for the brain. Physical activity appears to be one of the most promising measures we have to prevent cognitive decline and dementia,” Tari said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slows down aging processes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article evaluated evidence from both animal and human studies, and shows how physical activity affects inflammation, blood flow, immune function, brain plasticity and the release of protective molecules in the blood – processes that weaken with age and contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are mechanisms that play an important role in the development of dementia and cognitive decline,” Tari said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tari and Wisløff are researchers at the Cardiac Exercise Research Group (CERG) at NTNU, and have previously promoted the idea that microtraining – going from no activity to incorporating small doses of pulse training into everyday life – be included in the recommendations from Norwegian health authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the recommendation is at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of high intensity per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fully 50 to 70 per cent of the population does not manage today’s activity recommendations, Wisløff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small doses – high intensity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers point out that exercising much less than what the current recommendations recommend can provide great benefits – as long as the intensity of the training is high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tari and Wisløff believe that this new study makes it even more important to get the message out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe it’s time for health authorities to provide clearer advice on how important exercise is for the brain. Our review shows that even small doses of high-intensity activity – equivalent to brisk walking where you can’t sing – can reduce the risk of dementia by up to 40 per cent,” Wisløff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never too late to start&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International research supports the NTNU researchers’ findings. In a commentary in Nature Medicine in January, American researchers argued that public guidelines need to be updated. Even small doses of physical activity provide health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today’s recommendations emphasize total activity, but we show that even small amounts of high intensity exercise have an effect on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This should be communicated more clearly – it may be what motivates people to get started. A little is better than nothing – and it’s never too late to start,” says Tari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As life expectancy increases, cognitive decline and dementia are becoming a major public health challenge. Since there is still no cure, prevention is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise is cheap, accessible and has no side effects. It should be considered a first-line measure to preserve brain health,” Tari said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this exercise and brain aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ingebjørg Hestvik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NTNU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Ingebjørg Hestvik – NTNU&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)00184-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroprotective mechanisms of exercise and the importance of fitness for healthy brain ageing&lt;/a&gt;” by Atefe R.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whooping cough, a bacterial infection that can be especially dangerous for babies and young children, is on the rise. Already in 2025 the U.S. has recorded &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/177663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;8,485 cases&lt;/a&gt;. That’s compared with 4,266 cases during the same period in 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like measles, which is also &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/24/measles-cases-deaths-vaccine-rates-rfk-jr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;spreading at unprecedented levels&lt;/a&gt;, whooping cough, more formally known as pertussis, can be &lt;a href="https://www.vaccinesafety.edu/vaccine-preventable-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;prevented by a safe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2019.0711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;effective vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. But with &lt;a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/vaccine-confidence-falls-as-belief-in-health-misinformation-grows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anti-vaccine sentiment increasing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/trump-cuts-threaten-free-vaccine-program-kids-amid-measles-outbreak-2025-04-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;cuts to immunization services&lt;/a&gt;, vaccination rates for whooping cough over the past two years have declined in children.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Conversation asked &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pu3L9HkAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;epidemiologist Annette Regan&lt;/a&gt; to explain why pertussis has become so prevalent and how families can protect themselves from the disease.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-pertussis-and-why-is-it-dangerous"&gt;What is pertussis and why is it dangerous?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pertussis&lt;/a&gt; is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by the bacterium &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7813/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bordetella pertussis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers in France &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrmicro3235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;first identified&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;em&gt;B. pertussis&lt;/em&gt; bacterium in 1906. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(15)00292-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;first recorded epidemic of pertussis&lt;/a&gt; is thought to have occurred in Paris in 1578.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infection &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/whooping-cough/"&gt;can cause&lt;/a&gt; an acute respiratory illness characterized by severe and spasmodic coughing spells. The classic symptom of pertussis is a “whoop” sound caused by someone trying to breath during a bad cough. &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/infectious-disease/whooping-cough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Severe complications of pertussis&lt;/a&gt; include slowed or stopped breathing, pneumonia and seizures. The disease is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2020.1791092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;most severe in young babies&lt;/a&gt;, although severe cases and deaths can also occur in older children and adults. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some doctors call pertussis &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-pertussis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;“the 100-day cough”&lt;/a&gt; because symptoms can linger for weeks or even months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization estimates that &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/vaccine-preventable-diseases-surveillance-standards-pertussis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;24.1 million pertussis cases and 160,700 deaths&lt;/a&gt; occur worldwide in children under 5 each year. Pertussis is highly contagious. Upon exposure, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/healthcare-personnel-epidemiology-control/pertussis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;80% of people&lt;/a&gt; who have not been previously exposed to the bacterium or vaccinated against the disease will develop an infection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the disease is largely preventable with a safe and effective vaccine, which was &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/history-disease-outbreaks-vaccine-timeline/whooping-cough" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;first licensed in the U.S. in 1914&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-do-cases-last-year-and-this-year-compare-with-past-years"&gt;How do cases last year and this year compare with past years?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/covid-19/"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; between 2020 and 2022, pertussis cases were lower than usual. This may have been a result of limited social contact due to social distancing, masking, school closures and lockdown measures, which &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjph-2023-000069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reduced the spread of disease overall&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the past two years, however, pertussis cases have surpassed figures from before the pandemic. In 2024, local and state public health agencies reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;35,435 pertussis cases&lt;/a&gt; to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – a rate five times higher than the 7,063 cases reported in 2023 and nearly double the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;18,617 cases&lt;/a&gt; reported in 2019 prior to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between October 2024 and April 2025, at least &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.r704" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;four people in the U.S. have died of pertussis&lt;/a&gt;: two infants, one school-age child and one adult.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-are-pertussis-cases-rising"&gt;Why are pertussis cases rising?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although vaccines have resulted in a dramatic decline in pertussis infections in the U.S., incidence of the disease has been rising since the 1990s, except for a brief &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dip during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before the start of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234373/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;routine childhood vaccination for pertussis in 1947&lt;/a&gt;, its rates &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hovered between 100,000 and 200,000 cases&lt;/a&gt; per year. With vaccines, rates plunged under 50,000 annually by the late 1950s and under 10,000 per year in the late 1960s. They reached a low of 1,010 cases in 1976.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Starting in the 1980s and 1990s, however, the U.S. and several other countries have been seeing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.01344" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a steady resurgence of pertussis cases&lt;/a&gt;, which have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/cases-of-whooping-cough-on-the-rise.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;exceeded 10,000 cases&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. every year from 2003 to 2019. They dropped again during the pandemic until last year’s resurgence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is no single explanation for why cases have been rising recently, but several factors probably contribute. First, pertussis naturally occurs in cyclic epidemics, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;peaking every two to five years&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible that the U.S. is headed into one of these peaks after a period of low activity between 2020 and 2022. However, some scientists have noted that the increase in cases is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2024.29.14.2400160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;larger than what would be expected&lt;/a&gt; during a usual peak.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Some scientists have noted that this apparent resurgence &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2019.01344" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;correlates with a change in the type of vaccine&lt;/a&gt; used in children. Until the 1990s, the pertussis vaccine contained &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000525468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;whole, killed &lt;em&gt;B. pertussis&lt;/em&gt; bacteria cells&lt;/a&gt;. Whole-cell vaccine can stimulate a long-lasting immune response, but it is also more likely to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d42859-020-00013-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cause fever and other vaccine reactions&lt;/a&gt; in children. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, national vaccine programs began to transition to a vaccine that contains purified components of the bacterial cell but not the whole cell. Some scientists now believe that although this partial-cell vaccine is less likely to cause high fevers in children, it &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4161/hv.29576" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;provides protection for a shorter time&lt;/a&gt;. Immunity after whole-cell vaccination is thought to last &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11010001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;10-12 years compared with three to five years&lt;/a&gt; after the partial-cell vaccine. This means people may become susceptible to infection more quickly after vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates are also not as high as they should be and have started falling in children since 2020. In the U.S., the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;percent of kindergartners who are up to &lt;/a&gt;date with recommended pertussis vaccines has declined from 95% during the 2019-20 school year to 92% in the 2023-24 school year. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7333a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Even fewer adolescents receive a booster dose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-can-people-protect-themselves-and-their-families"&gt;How can people protect themselves and their families?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Routine vaccination for children starting in infancy followed by booster doses in adolescents and adults can help keep immunity high. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health experts recommend that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;children receive five doses of the pertussis vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. According to the recommendations, they should receive the first three doses at 2, 4 and 6 months of age, then two additional doses at 15 months and 4 years of age, with the aim of providing protection through early adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infants younger than 6 weeks are not old enough to get a pertussis vaccine but are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32772755/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;at the greatest risk&lt;/a&gt; of severe illness from pertussis. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10121990" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vaccination during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;can offer protection from birth due to antibodies that pass from the mother to the developing fetus. Many countries, including the U.S., now recommend that women receive one dose of pertussis vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2017/09/update-on-immunization-and-pregnancy-tetanus-diphtheria-and-pertussis-vaccination" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;between the 27th and 36th week of every pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; to protect their babies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To maintain protection against pertussis after childhood, a booster dose of pertussis vaccine is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recommended for adolescents&lt;/a&gt; at 11 to 12 years of age. The CDC recommends that all adults receive at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;one booster dose&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Because immunity declines over time&lt;/a&gt;, people who are in contact with infants and other high-risk groups, such as caregivers, parents and grandparents, may benefit from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2012-3144" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;additional booster doses&lt;/a&gt;. When feasible, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC also recommends a booster dose&lt;/a&gt; for adults 65 years and older.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccine safety studies over the past 80 years have &lt;a href="https://www.vaccinesafety.edu/vaccine-preventable-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;proven the pertussis vaccine to be safe&lt;/a&gt;. Around 20% to 40% of vaccinated infants experience local reactions, such as pain, redness and swelling at the vaccination site, and 3% to 5% of vaccinated infants experience a low-grade fever. More severe reactions are much less common and occur in fewer than 1% of vaccinated infants. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is also highly effective: For the first year after receiving all five doses of the pertussis vaccine, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2012.14939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;98% of children are protected&lt;/a&gt; from pertussis. Five years after the fifth dose, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2019.0711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;65% of vaccinated children&lt;/a&gt; remain protected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Booster vaccination during adolescence protects &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap-tdap-td/hcp/about-vaccine.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;74% of teens&lt;/a&gt; against pertussis, and booster vaccination during pregnancy protects &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-4824-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;91% to 94%&lt;/a&gt; of immunized babies against hospitalization due to pertussis. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Families can talk to their regular health care providers about whether a pertussis vaccine is needed for their child, themselves or other family members.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MINNESOTA, USA — As the weather gets warmer, the bugs come out to play in Minnesota.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One bug to beware of is the tick. If a tick bite goes unnoticed, it can develop into Lyme disease and anaplasmosis in humans. University of Minnesota Associate Professor Jon Oliver, who is researching ticks, shared advice on the tick outlook for the summer and how to identify and treat yourself if you receive a bite.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the state had wet weather in the summer of 2024, immature ticks were able to thrive and grow into nymphs, according to Oliver. He expected an average number of ticks this summer and adult ticks to make an appearance on days that are warmer than 60 degrees.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ticks are most often found in forested areas. Oliver advised to wear insect repellents with DEET or other EPA-approved repellents to keep ticks away. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also tuck your pant legs into your socks or wear clothes with permethrin in them to keep ticks away from your skin. Make sure to check yourself for ticks after spending time outdoors so that you notice a tick bite sooner rather than later. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do find a tick on your body, use tweezers to grab the tick by its mouth where it is entering your skin and pull it straight off. Avoid crushing its body, according to Oliver. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you develop a rash or flu-like symptoms after you've been bitten by a tick, visit your doctor. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

When a person with TB coughs, speaks or sings, germs are expelled into the air -- where they can linger for several hours -- before another person breathes in the air and becomes infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Signs and symptoms&lt;/a&gt; include a cough that lasts for three weeks or longer, coughing up blood or phlegm, chest pain, weakness, fatigue, weight loss, loss of appetite, fever, chills and night sweats, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Some people become infected with TB germs that live in the body for years without causing illness.

								&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been keeping an eye on &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/01/08/fearing-another-pandemic-people-are-prepping-for-bird-flu-should-you/" target="_blank"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; ever since it was first discovered nearly 30 years ago. Experts have long recognized that the H5N1 virus that causes the disease has &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(24)00238-X/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;pandemic potential&lt;/a&gt;, just like COVID-19 or swine flu. In the past three years, outbreaks of bird flu, formally called highly pathogenic avian influenza, in wild animals spilled over to dairy cows and poultry, infecting several dozen humans and even killing one American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each human and mammalian infection gives the virus an opportunity to mutate and evolve better ways of transmitting from person to person — a key benchmark for what makes a pathogen a pandemic-level threat. And numerous &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ame91llKsyc" target="_blank"&gt;headlines&lt;/a&gt; and scientific publications have &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adw3278" target="_blank"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that we're inching closer and closer to just such a scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the last couple weeks have been relatively quiet. Other than the report of a child death from H5N1 bird flu in Durango, Mexico on April 8, and of another child, in India's Andhra Pradesh state, who died March 15, there has been seemingly little in the news about H5N1 bird flu. H5N1 has become prevalent in wild birds but also spread to infect mammals on every continent, &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/avian-flu-is-rapidly-spreading-across-antarctica-180986222/" target="_blank"&gt;even Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the odd human, although mammal-to-mammal transmission remains limited and human-to-human transmission has not been seen — yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've actually had a very active H5N1 year, and a lot of outbreaks in the U.S. in wildlife."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;tracking the outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;, but their online dashboard has updated little in the last several weeks. Statistics for human cases have remained unchanged since the start of the year, when an elderly resident of Louisiana became &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/01/06/first-us-from-bird-flu-reported-in-louisiana/" target="_blank"&gt;the first human to die of H5N1 bird flu in the United States&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the CDC says that there have been 70 US human cases, and that number seems to not have changed either, despite recent testing of a child in San Francisco who was found to have H5N1 bird flu, and a recent case in Ohio. But experts say the mysteriously static numbers should not be cause for relief, but rather for creeping unease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ask computational biologist Martha Nelson, a staff scientist at the National Institutes of Health, it hasn't been a quiet year for bird flu. Not at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So I can tell you on the wildlife side, we've actually had a very active H5N1 year, and a lot of outbreaks in the U.S. in wildlife," she told Salon in a video interview. "The virus is certainly not going away ... you know, it's certainly still evolving rapidly, picking up new genome segments from the low pathogenicity viruses that are endemic in the Americas that are not found in Eurasia, so opening all these new avenues for evolution."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New avenues for evolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Agriculture continues to log confirmed reports of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry flocks, and a quick look at its tracker confirms that there is &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks" target="_blank"&gt;a hell of a lot of bird flu out there&lt;/a&gt;. It can be difficult keeping track of all the different short forms used to distinguish one genotype from another so scientists can keep track as the virus evolves. Even the researchers Salon spoke with had to double-check different names during our conversation, so there's no shame in getting them confused. But these seemingly minor genetic differences can actually have a big impact on how the virus infects people and how severe the illness becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first case of H5N1 in cattle back in Texas in March of last year &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq0900" target="_blank"&gt;involved the genotype B3.13&lt;/a&gt;. But D1.1 and D1.3 are the genotypes that have been more recently sweeping across the United States. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON564#:~:text=On%2013%20March%2C%20the%20case,April%20due%20to%20respiratory%20complications." target="_blank"&gt;The child who died in Mexico&lt;/a&gt; contracted D1.1 (it's not clear how it was acquired and none of the child's contacts seem to have been infected.) The teenager in Canada last November who &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/387/bmj.q2529" target="_blank"&gt;survived a very serious case of H5N1 bird flu&lt;/a&gt; thanks to intensive treatment — which would be likely impossible to roll out at scale in the case of a full-blown pandemic — also had the D1.1 genotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Those genotypes seem to be very prevalent in wildlife and wild birds, and then spilling over onto poultry farms," Nelson said. "The H5N1 challenge: it's always present, it's just coming in slightly different forms."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the D1.1 and D1.3 genotypes making their way into commercial poultry operations, D1.1 has spilled over into cattle multiple times, offering new opportunities for humans to become infected. The &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/program-update/aphis-confirms-d11-genotype-dairy-cattle-nevada-0" target="_blank"&gt;Nevada outbreak in dairy cows in January&lt;/a&gt; (and the dairy worker &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/08/health/bird-flu-variant-nevada-human-case/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;who in February&lt;/a&gt; became the state's first human case) and the Arizona outbreak &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/third-avian-flu-spillover-reported-arizona-dairy-herd-raw-pet-food-sickens#:~:text=for%20Priority%20Pathogens-,Third%20avian%20flu%20spillover%20reported%20in%20Arizona%20dairy%20herd,pet%20food%20sickens%20Oregon%20cats&amp;amp;text=For%20the%20second%20time%20in,herd%20in%20Arizona's%20Maricopa%20County." target="_blank"&gt;identified through national milk testing in February&lt;/a&gt;, for example, were D1.1, a hybrid virus created from the already-prevalent low pathogenic influenza virus trading genetic material with highly pathogenic avian flu virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That [the emergence of D.1.1 in cattle made us think] it doesn't seem quiet on our end, because we all thought [the B3.13] spillover into cattle was kind of a fluke. Like, that's a one-off thing, like that's never going to happen again," Nelson said. "And what we're seeing through bulk milk surveillance is that actually, spillover is happening. Whenever you have these pulses in H5N1 activity in wildlife, it's spilling over into cattle."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bulk milk surveillance program is the only way we know what is going on with cattle, and it's vital (even though there is an inherent testing bias, in that not all milk is tested and we may assume that if sporadic and random testing doesn't turn up H5N1, that means it's not there, an assumption that may well be incorrect.) Bulk milk surveillance is the main component of the National Milk Testing Strategy, which late in 2024 set out a roadmap for states to follow to eliminate H5N1 bird flu from cattle. But the program is voluntary, being rolled out state by state in an unclear way (according to the USDA's weekly report of April 25, &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/livestock/nmts" target="_blank"&gt;45 states are currently enrolled&lt;/a&gt; in the program.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the USDA writes on its website that "the National Milk Testing Strategy (NMTS) establishes a structured, uniform and mandatory testing system that supports the December 2024 Federal Order", the uniformity and structure are debatable, given that much of surveillance is "state-specific" and a problem before the federal order was that &lt;a href="http://National%20Milk%20Testing%20Strategy%20(NMTS)%20establishes%20a%20structured,%20uniform,%20and%20mandatory%20testing%20system%20that%20supports%20the%20December%202024%20Federal%20Order" target="_blank"&gt;farmers refused to provide milk for testing&lt;/a&gt;: while the federal order requires they now provide milk for testing when asked, it's not clear how this is enforced or how different states choose where and how aggressively to test. And the Food and Drug Administration recently &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/fda-suspends-program-improve-bird-flu-testing-due-staff-cuts-2025-04-03/" target="_blank"&gt;halted work to improve bird flu testing of milk&lt;/a&gt; due to staffing cuts, and, even more alarming, last week announced the agency was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-suspends-milk-quality-tests-amid-workforce-cuts-2025-04-21/" target="_blank"&gt;suspending quality testing of the highest quality of fluid raw milk&lt;/a&gt; for the same reason, though it has claimed that this is a temporary pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for human cases, "in the U.S., there has been almost no reporting of new cases," virologist Angela Rasmussen told Salon. "I'm positive that this is because they are not monitoring people who are getting infected, and there are far fewer tests being performed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasmussen is an American based in Canada, where she teaches at the University of Saskatchewan and is a research scientist at the &lt;a href="https://www.vido.org" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccine and Infectious Disease Research Organization-International Vaccine Centre&lt;/a&gt;. She blames funding cuts and mass layoffs since the start of the current administration for the reduction in monitoring. USDA staff involved in national laboratory testing to confirm cases of H5N1 and other animal diseases were laid off early on in the mass federal layoffs recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency, but by late February the Associated Press reported that &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/usda-firings-doge-bird-flu-trump-fdd6495cbe44c96d471ae8c6cf4dd0a8" target="_blank"&gt;the agency was scrambling to rehire them&lt;/a&gt;. But later cuts and layoffs at the CDC, FDA and the NIH, as well as at the USDA, including at APHIS, have all affected data sharing between states and the federal government as well as uniformity of testing and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Atmosphere of complete chaos"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasmussen also blames certain policies of the Trump administration less obviously related to monitoring for H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One, there are fewer resources in general being put towards surveillance, monitoring and testing, and two, given that a significant proportion of the dairy agriculture workers who are likely to be most at risk of exposure are undocumented, and they are very strongly disincentivized to seek out testing when the result of that could be being expatriated and sent potentially to a prison in El Salvador," Rasmussen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in February, Salon reported that immigrant and especially &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/02/09/migrants-are-on-the-front-lines-of-the-bird-flu-but-deportation-fears-are-causing-chaos/" target="_blank"&gt;undocumented workers&lt;/a&gt; are in closest contact with cows, most likely to notice concerning symptoms in herds and to become infected themselves, and less likely to get regular flu vaccines, which puts them at greater risk of incubating new variants. This is because regular influenza can trade genetic material with H5N1 bird flu in the event of co-infection. But as Rasmussen said, the reasons to not draw any attention from the feds have only increased, even for workers whose papers are in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The USDA has not really done anything, from what I can tell, to even address the cattle outbreak when they put out their new avian [bird] flu strategy," Rasmussen noted. "It basically only dealt with the poultry outbreaks, and that strategy relies pretty heavily on improving biosecurity, so making sure that people are not bringing the virus to and from different farms with them, making sure that wild birds can't access poultry houses." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She notes that both the USDA and the CDC are less forthcoming with information than they were previously, including about the biosecurity audits run by USDA that, according to the new plan, must be carried out by USDA staff in order for farmers to be compensated for outbreaks on their farms that require culling of birds. Hundreds of USDA staff members were &lt;a href="https://investigatemidwest.org/2025/04/24/after-forcing-resignations-usda-tries-to-walk-back-staff-cuts-and-calls-frontline-workers-vital/" target="_blank"&gt;forced out over recent months&lt;/a&gt; and it's unclear whether the staff needed to perform these audits actually exist at the agency anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My bigger problem with that entire plan is really three things," Rasmussen continued. "They barely even mentioned the cattle outbreak, and we know that the cows have actually given the virus back to birds, so that's one mechanism, potentially, for that cow virus to continue being transmitted to other species." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Nelson, Rasmussen feels that the discovery of D1.1 genotype bird flu in cows was a watershed moment. "It was really distressing when those D1.1 genotype cases were found in cows, because it seemed like for the past year that this was a really rare event," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasmussen said that the Canadian equivalent to the USDA, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, continues to test both retail and tank milk and has not found any positives in the country. Still, while before the D1.1 discovery there was speculation that local differences in policy — feeding poultry litter to cows as they do in Texas, or the much bigger size of dairy operations in the U.S. — might have contributed to greater susceptibility to the disease spilling over from birds to cows. Now it seems that, as Rasmussen said, "it could happen anywhere, if there's the opportunity for birds to interface with the cows, which is why they should have controlled the cow outbreak a long time ago. And if they had taken more aggressive action in March or April of 2024 I think we might be in a very different position right now," she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most critical issue is that we know there's H5N1 bird flu in cows, but we don't know how many cows are currently infected in the U.S., and it's unlikely that we have an accurate count of human cases. The same goes for pigs — a single case was &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/11/01/bird-flu-detected-in-pigs-for-first-time-as-confirmed-human-cases-double-in-two-weeks/" target="_blank"&gt;found among five backyard pigs in October&lt;/a&gt; in a non-commercial operation where swine mixed with poultry and other livestock. While it didn't spread, pigs are considered especially worrisome among mammalian vectors of bird flu because they harbor many influenza viruses that can co-exist with it, swapping genetic material, and because they are generally kept in close quarters and with proximity to humans, and because pigs have receptors in their respiratory tract that would allow them to be simultaneously infected with &lt;a href="https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1746-6148-6-4" target="_blank"&gt;a bird and a human influenza&lt;/a&gt; virus, allowing for exchange of the genetic material that might allow H5N1 bird flu to acquire the very few mutations still needed to allow for it to spread readily between humans. And yet there appears to be no specific monitoring or testing of pork processing or swine-raising facilities at all. As the industry publication &lt;a href="https://www.pigprogress.net/market-trends-analysis-the-industrymarkets/us-pork-processing-preparations-underway-for-mass-deportations-of-illegal-workers/" target="_blank"&gt;Pig Progress noted in December&lt;/a&gt;, such facilities depend heavily on the very undocumented labor being targeted for mass deportations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would we know if a suspicious cluster of human cases, that could represent the first sustained human-to-human transmission of the disease, were happening? Perhaps not. What's not clear though is whether the problem is lack of data or lack of transparency about the data. Rasmussen's suggestion was that the necessary monitoring was not happening in the United States. But she also noted that the &lt;a href="https://www.wsaz.com/2025/02/07/weekly-cdc-report-returns-omits-bird-flu/" target="_blank"&gt;CDC withheld publication of certain H5N1 studies&lt;/a&gt; in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report for a couple of weeks, reportedly, she said, for political reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So I do think it's possible that there is H5N1 data that's being collected and being suppressed, but I don't know." But, she speculated, "it may not be that that information is being intentionally concealed, but it may be that there's just not enough people to actually get this information into a form that would be releasable to the public."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influenza division at the CDC lots staff to probationary firings as well as on Valentine's Day when further staff were fired en masse. "And so my understanding, at least from people within the CDC who work closely with the influenza division, is that it lost a lot of people, but also the people who are still there, there's just this atmosphere of complete chaos ... They're trying to do the same amount of work with fewer resources." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second problem with the new avian flu plan is, in Rasmussen's view, that it doesn't even really acknowledge that a vaccine was conditionally approved in February and early March, nor mention using it to prevent infection in poultry, which would help to limit spread and reduce the chances of a more human-adapted variant emerging. Vaccines have been effective in China and Vietnam and Egypt for quelling outbreaks. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14575101/#:~:text=The%20avian%20influenza%20high%2Dpathogenicity,reliable%20monitoring%20program%20for%20AI." target="_blank"&gt;In Mexico, an outbreak of H5N2&lt;/a&gt;, a different form of bird flu, was successfully controlled in the 1990s, and quite quickly, by vaccination along with culling and controls on poultry movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our bovine [cow] outbreak, we haven't taken that route," Nelson noted. "And that's largely because there's trade implications if you vaccinate." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when the French began to vaccinate ducks for H5N1, the U.S. and other countries &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-canada-ease-ban-french-poultry-imposed-after-bird-flu-vaccination-2025-01-20/" target="_blank"&gt;banned imports&lt;/a&gt; of their H5N1-free poultry. Then again, Nelson noted that using a vaccine effectively entails other activities: there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the possibility of silent transmission and accelerating evolution through vaccines that are not perfect matches to the circulating strains of the virus. Intensive biological monitoring is required, and for exports to be protected, you need a global system for transparent sharing of data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a big policy question that would be very helpful to establish going forward," Nelson said. On whether it might be a challenging time for creating such a global system for transparently sharing information, Nelson said only, "no comment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cruel and ineffective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The third thing," according to Rasmussen, "is that that plan mentions that they would like to reduce the amount of culling that happens in avian outbreaks."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this last point, Rasmussen grimaced, pointing out that health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed not culling birds stricken with the disease, suggesting that we might identify naturally immune chickens by letting it spread unchecked. Essentially the idea, for which the secretary of agriculture Brooke Rollins has also voiced support, seems to be that survivors might become super chickens with innate resistance to bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But highly pathogenic avian influenza is aptly named because of what it does to birds, including chickens. There is no innate resistance. Rasmussen said that it has an essentially 100% mortality rate: "You will not have surviving chickens that are likely to be super resistant chickens. You're not likely to have any surviving at all. And pathogenesis of flu in birds, in chickens is really, really gruesome, and it presents a huge risk for anybody who would have to clean up after just sort of letting it go. Flu in birds is gastrointestinal and well as respiratory. So, I mean, you're talking about birds convulsing, bloody diarrhea, bloody vomit. A lot of really gross stuff. A lot of really terrible suffering for those animals. And a really dangerous situation where you have potentially hundreds of thousands of bird carcasses that are loaded with high titre H5N1 virus."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/php/avian-flu-summary/h5n1-human-infections.html" target="_blank"&gt;probable cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, including H5N1&lt;/a&gt; — but, crucially, not the same H5N1 that is circulating now — being passed from one human to another in a very limited way. No such cases have been reported in the United States. And so far, there is no evidence that the current H5N1 bird flu can be transmitted from one human to another. Nevertheless, scientists believe it's only a matter of time, or time plus opportunity for the virus to evolve the necessary mutations — before a version that is well-adapted to humans begins to show human-to-human infection in a sustained way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mammalian adaption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm a cat person, so I'm intrigued by this," said Nelson, when asked about the risk to or from cats from H5N1 bird flu. "Cats kind of fall [off] the radar because they're not livestock, they're not USDA, so there's no kind of dedicated funding for studying cats." They don't fall under the purview of the USDA, nor within the purview of the NIH, which focuses on human health. "So far, we've seen all these different routes by which cats can get infected." Barn cats have been infected by drinking H5N1-infected milk that splatters around during the milking process. House cats have also been &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/02/12/cats-with-bird-flu-could-pose-a-risk-to-public-health_partner/" target="_blank"&gt;infected through frozen raw pet food&lt;/a&gt; — the virus survives very well in freezers, Nelson noted. And there are cases that are suspected to have resulted from outdoor cats that play with or scavenge infected or dead birds. Finally, there was a cat that appears to have been infected by its owner, a dairy farm worker, possibly just through virus on his clothing. "It just shows how complicated this disease system is, that something as simple as a house cat can get infected four different ways," Nelson said. Cats are highly susceptible to the virus, and infection with it is &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-h5n1-cats" target="_blank"&gt;very serious and frequently fatal in cats&lt;/a&gt;. By contrast the threat to humans from cats who pick up the virus is currently considered low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A December analysis published &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt0180" target="_blank"&gt;in Science showed that a single mutation&lt;/a&gt; in the genes coding for the protein hemagglutinin in H5N1 bird flu virus in cows could be enough to change the virus' receptor specificity, which still favors birds, to target humans. Hemagglutinin, which is the H part of the virus' name and is related to severity of infection, is attached to the surface of the virus, helping it get into cells. A switch from glutamine to leucinein resulting from just one mutation could switch the virus from being able to easily bind to avian, or bird, receptors to favouring human receptors in the respiratory tract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I would suspect," Nelson said, "That for every [human] infection we detect there's a great deal more that are just undiagnosed." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These would mostly be among people with occupational exposure, like workers in the pork, beef and poultry industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Just because people aren't hearing about H5N1 in the news, just because there isn't some massive outbreak with lots of human cases [doesn't mean it's gone away]. For scientists, this is just kind of an ongoing problem, that just continues to escalate in its complexity," said Nelson, noting the emergence of D1.1, of new human cases, of continued outbreaks in wildlife and of transmission through pet food. "You know, this problem is staying with us for the near future, probably long term. And I think that's what really alarms people ... Just that we don't seem to have a strategy to contain this over the long term."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When or if that happens, we'll be at the start of a pandemic that could make COVID-19 look mild in comparison, though of course anyone with long COVID will say it's very far from just a cold. Speaking of COVID, that pandemic may have waned lately, but &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home" target="_blank"&gt;tens of thousands of infections still occur weekly&lt;/a&gt;, as well as several hundred deaths. And we're always just one nasty mutation — something the SARS-CoV-2 virus has done countless times — away from another major resurgence of COVID. Coupled with the return of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/03/11/you-dont-want-to-throw-a-measles-party/" target="_blank"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/02/21/tuberculosis-is-on-the-rise-again-we-can-fight-it--if-we-try/" target="_blank"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; and more, H5N1 is likely just another of symptom of the erosion of public health and trust in science. We need to monitor and study it — to understand it — if we want to keep it at bay.&lt;/p&gt;

You’ve got the usual players like vitamins C, D and E. And these days, trendy newcomers like nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD, are also taking up significant real estate on store shelves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the global NAD market was $535.5 million, and it's expected to balloon to $1.7 billion by 2032, according to &lt;a href="https://www.polarismarketresearch.com/industry-analysis/nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide-market" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Polaris Market Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Polaris Market Research&lt;/a&gt;. With that kind of growing popularity, NAD must have some major benefits — right? To find out, we reached out to experts. Here's what they had to say. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is NAD?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, NAD is an essential molecule found in every cell that our bodies must have to function. "Without it, life stops in seconds," says &lt;a href="https://sinclair.hms.harvard.edu/people/david-sinclair" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David A. Sinclair, Ph.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David A. Sinclair, Ph.D&lt;/a&gt;., a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School Paul F. Glenn Center for Biology of Aging Research and the author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lifespan-Why-Age_and-Dont-Have/dp/1501191977/?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.64566791%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lifespan: Why We Age — and Why We Don’t Have To;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Lifespan: Why We Age — and Why We Don’t Have To&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;“NAD is used by the body to carry out chemical reactions involved in processes such as energy production, DNA repair and activating longevity-promoting enzymes like sirtuins.” It's also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10665902/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:linked to your circadian rhythm;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;linked to your circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6342515/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies in mice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies in mice&lt;/a&gt; have found that higher levels of NAD may prevent fatty liver disease, improve kidney function, strengthen muscles, maintain a healthy cardiovascular system, lower inflammation, protect neurons and slow aging. &lt;strong&gt;There isn’t enough research on humans yet to say that increasing the amount of NAD in your body will result in all of those health benefits, but scientists are exploring the possibilities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, our level of NAD tends to decline with age — and the amount by which it drops varies by type of tissue, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8747183/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found. That's why some people turn to supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should you take an NAD supplement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, testing for NAD levels is not a routine part of health care and there’s no established recommended daily intake. That said, there are ways to evaluate the amount of NAD you have. “High-functioning organs like the brain, heart, liver and muscles require greater amounts of NAD,” says &lt;a href="https://tobyamidornutrition.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Toby Amidor, M.S., R.D., C.D.N., F.A.N.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Toby Amidor, M.S., R.D., C.D.N., F.A.N.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition expert and partner with Niagen Bioscience, which sells NAD products. “While direct measurement in these tissues typically requires biopsies or advanced imaging like MRIs, a less invasive way to assess overall NAD status is through blood testing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, how your body feels is the best indicator that something is amiss. “Fatigue, brain fog and metabolic slowdown could be signs that your NAD levels are declining,” says Sinclair. Of course, many other things can cause those symptoms as well so if you’re feeling off and think low levels of NAD could be a contributing factor, talk to your physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;RamilF - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, the NAD molecule itself is so large and unwieldy that it’s difficult for the body to use when taken as a supplement. &lt;/strong&gt;“Supplements called NAD boosters typically contain either NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) or NR (nicotinamide riboside),” says Sinclair. “The body uses NR to make NMN, which is then converted to NAD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might think you could save your body a little effort if you gave it NMN instead of NR, but you may not find NMN in stores. Because pharmaceutical companies started looking into NMN as a potential drug, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10721522/#:~:text=However%2C%20on%2010%20November%2C%202022,developed%20as%20a%20novel%20drug." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:FDA banned its sale as a dietary supplement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;FDA banned its sale as a dietary supplement&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. in 2022. The &lt;a href="https://www.npanational.org/news/npa-wins-huge-legal-victory-against-fda-on-nmn/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Natural Products Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Natural Products Association&lt;/a&gt; (NPA) then filed a lawsuit against the FDA and in 2024, a federal court ruled that the FDA couldn’t take unauthorized punitive action against NMN vendors for the time being so it’s still sold by some companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you get NAD from the food you eat?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we don’t absorb NAD directly from food, our bodies can produce it from specific nutrients found in whole foods,” says &lt;a href="https://serenaloves.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Serena Poon, C.N., C.H.C., C.H.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Serena Poon, C.N., C.H.C., C.H.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a certified nutritionist and founder of the wellness brand Serena Loves. Here are some strategies for obtaining NAD precursors through food:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MNM:&lt;/strong&gt; “Broccoli and green beans are especially rich in NMN,” says Poon. “Beetroot, cucumber peel, spinach, carrots, scallions and collard greens are also valuable sources.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NR:&lt;/strong&gt; “For NR, top choices include wild chicory, bananas, oranges, avocados, leeks, cilantro and purple taro,” says Poon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Niacin/vitamin B3:&lt;/strong&gt; “Niacin-rich foods — like mushrooms, sunflower seeds, peanut butter, brown rice, sweet potatoes, oats, quinoa and green peas — support NAD production,” says Poon. Fish and poultry also contain niacin, adds Amidor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tryptophan:&lt;/strong&gt; “Tryptophan, an amino acid that converts into niacin, is found in pumpkin seeds, lentils, tofu, tempeh, chickpeas almonds and cashews,” says Poon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s also worth noting that preparation matters,” says Poon. “Steaming is an ideal cooking method for preserving NMN in foods like green beans and beets, while NR is more heat-sensitive, so enjoying certain fruits and leafy greens raw can help maintain their potency.” Just keep in mind that it’s probably not possible to eat enough food to bring NAD levels up to youthful levels, according to Sinclair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any lifestyle habits that can boost NAD?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7752291/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research suggests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that short bursts of hot or cold exposure (such as in a sauna), a diet that’s not high in fat or sugar, exercising and cutting calories may help increase NAD in your body. However, these methods aren’t recommended for everyone, and they may not lead to a meaningful long-term difference in NAD levels so many people depend on NAD booster supplements instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to choose an NAD booster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, talk to your doctor to make sure they think it’s a good idea for you to supplement with NAD. “There are a few ways to elevate NAD, including oral capsules and IV or injection therapy,” says Amidor. &lt;strong&gt;“It’s important to remember that supplementing or infusing with NAD directly is not efficient or as effective to raise NAD. Although NAD IV is popular amongst celebrities and athletes, it can take hours and induce severe side effects, such as nausea, headache and diarrhea.”&lt;/strong&gt; If your doctor gives you the green light and recommends a dosage, here are some tips to consider when selecting an oral supplement to increase NAD levels:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Look for the most well-studied and bioavailable forms: nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN),” says Poon. “These &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10692436/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:have been shown;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;have been shown&lt;/a&gt; to effectively raise NAD levels and support cellular health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Check for third party certifications, testing and evidence of clinical research,” says Amidor. The FDA regulates dietary supplements but doesn’t approve them all before they are sold. “As a result, product quality and safety becomes the responsibility of the manufacturers, but not all companies take this seriously,” adds Amidor. U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) and NSF International are two reputable third-party testing organizations. You can also request a Certificate of Analysis from the manufacturer, Poon says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Avoid vague ‘proprietary blends’ or ‘extracts,” suggests Sinclair. You should know exactly what you’re ingesting and these extras really are not needed in an NAD booster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:52:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE5qb3g1UGd1RlBMTDIxOTlKMG40Y3JtMTlUWGhNWXZqOHlFZTdaSXU0eE9vMExwc1lPZS1BX2V1bU5TeUpsRXp1VkJrdTE3UTFncGx6blNqS1hjWnZXbXA3VXdsUFk1WUJqWTlTcXFjY3J2STBGYW9sdg</guid></item><item><title>全新AI工具可准确检测从RRMS到SPMS的过渡-今日多发性硬化症新闻 | New AI tool accurately detects transition from RRMS to SPMS - Multiple Sclerosis News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxQYXphVENXZHZ1Sk9FVUQwZWdTNlZDWU1rbmxrRDZsS1l0UVoxQnBNRkNHTUJFbFplV2plZzdDdEN2NWVJWnhFbzFYQkc0b1RoSXA5UzF3cWlMWU5MdEZ2N2pxaXM4Z0VCa2x3U3hpNGdJa3RzMm5EVFNyRmd6RUxHUGxrYmNCRC1UTTZxUF9KVnpvN01EWklwRDR3QTl1QjZYU25kVkg0X3B0cE5idjhqN3h2SC1OOVU1emc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new machine learning tool, a form of artificial intelligence (AI), may accurately detect the transition from &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms"&gt;relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (RRMS) to &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/secondary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-spms"&gt;secondary progressive multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (SPMS) — and may be able to do so even earlier than clinicians can — a new study showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, their newly developed AI model may improve diagnostics in &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By recognising patterns from previous patients, the model can determine whether a patient has the relapsing-remitting form or whether the disease has transitioned to secondary progressive MS,” Kim Kultima, PhD, the study’s senior author and a professor at Uppsala University in Sweden, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.uu.se/en/press/press-releases/2025/2025-04-28-new-ai-model-improves-ms-diagnostics"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per the study team: “We present here a first-of-its-kind predictive model that is able to distinguish between RRMS and SPMS at high accuracy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team noted that “the gradual transition” among patients from RRMS to SPMS “is often diagnosed retrospectively with a typical delay of three years.” This new model has the potential “to distinguish between RRMS and SPMS at each individual [doctor] visit,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study “&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01616-z"&gt;Conformal prediction enables disease course prediction and allows individualized diagnostic uncertainty in multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;npj Digital Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Researchers use AI tool to develop predictive model for MS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people with multiple sclerosis initially develop RRMS, which is marked by &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-flares/"&gt;relapses&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; worsen, interspersed with periods of remission when symptoms ease. Over time, many people with RRMS will transition to SPMS — characterized by symptoms that get gradually worse over time irrespective of relapse activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diagnosing the transition from RRMS to SPMS is important because these two &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/4-types-ms/"&gt;MS types&lt;/a&gt; have distinct responses to the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapies&lt;/a&gt; now available to patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Proactive recognition of patients with progressive disease could limit exposure to ineffective medications and their side effects,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, however, there are no solid criteria defining the transition between disease types. Usually such diagnoses are made by looking at how a patient’s symptoms have changed from previous years. As such, patients generally are not diagnosed with SPMS until they’ve already been living with this type of MS for several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To improve MS diagnoses, Kultima and colleagues set out to create a machine learning tool to detect the transition from RRMS to SPMS based on data collected from patients at routine checkups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning is a form of AI that uses mathematical rules called algorithms to analyze a large set of data, learn from its analyses, and make predictions based on the learned patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build the model, the researchers used data from more than 22,000 people with MS, collected between 1972 and 2022, in the Swedish MS Registry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data from most of the patients was used to train, validate, and calibrate the machine learning tool, and data from the remaining 3,595 patients was used to subsequently test it. The test dataset comprised 2,451 people with RRMS, 677 with SPMS, and 467 who had an initial RRMS diagnosis but then transitioned to SPMS during follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;In 26% of cases, model ID’d MS transition earlier than doctors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the new model overall was 92.1% accurate at discriminating between RRMS and SPMS at a given hospital visit. The model also correctly predicted an initial RRMS diagnosis and a later transition to SPMS in 68.5% of the 467 patients who experienced such transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more than half of these cases, the tool identified the switch from RRMS to SPMS at almost exactly the same time as patients’ records changed. Moreover, in 26.6% of cases, the model identified the switch at an earlier hospital visit than doctors had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For patients, this means that the diagnosis can be made earlier, which makes it possible to adjust the patient’s treatment in time and slow down the progression of the disease,” Kultima said. “This also reduces the risk of patients receiving medicines that are no longer effective.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;What is unique about the model is that it also indicates how confident it is in each individual assessment. … This means that the doctor will know how reliable the conclusion is and how confident the AI is in its assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to identifying which type of MS the patient has, the machine learning tool includes conformal prediction — basically, a way for the computer to report how certain it is that its labeling is correct for each patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is unique about the model is that it also indicates how confident it is in each individual assessment,” Kultima said. “This means that the doctor will know how reliable the conclusion is and how confident the AI is in its assessment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers have made a version of their tool &lt;a href="https://msp-tracker.serve.scilifelab.se/"&gt;publicly available online&lt;/a&gt; so that other researchers and clinicians can explore its utility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the long term, the model could also be used to identify suitable participants for clinical trials – which could contribute to more effective and individualised treatment strategies,” Kultima said.&lt;/p&gt;

The clinical trial began in July 2024 in hopes of making the treatment publicly available by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-missing-teeth-and-protein"&gt;Missing teeth and protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24168-anodontia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anodontia&lt;/a&gt; rate of around &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0528.2004.00158.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;1%&lt;/a&gt; of the general population presents a problem for those who cannot develop a complete set of permanent teeth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This condition can affect speech and eating from an early age. Traditional treatments often involve dentures or dental implants, but these approaches can carry inconveniences for young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe the new therapy could help children aged 2 to 6 who lack adult teeth. They are examining a way to block a protein linked with limiting tooth growth in mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-protein-blocking-breakthrough"&gt;Protein blocking breakthrough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, scientists discovered that the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abf1798" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;USAG-1 protein&lt;/a&gt; plays a direct role in regulating the development of new teeth. When this protein is active, it can prevent additional teeth from forming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By crafting a medication to neutralize it, Takahashi’s team encouraged animals to grow teeth beyond their normal sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested their medication on mice with missing teeth. They observed tooth development in those mice where none had grown before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-the-discovery-matters"&gt;Why the discovery matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people are born with two sets of teeth. Yet some animals – like sharks – regrow many sets as needed. Scientists once believed humans did not have any spare tooth buds beyond baby and adult teeth, but evidence now suggests we have a latent third set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea of growing new teeth is every dentist’s dream. I’ve been working on this since I was a graduate student. I was confident I’d be able to make it happen,” said Takahashi. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some individuals show a tendency toward &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/hyperdontia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hyperdontia&lt;/a&gt;, which means they form extra teeth. One in three such cases involves growth of a third set. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-animal-research-on-protein-and-teeth"&gt;Animal research on protein and teeth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trials on &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32922570/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt; paved the way for studies in ferrets. The medication spurred the growth of an extra front tooth, suggesting that ferrets – like mice – possess the capacity for additional sets. It showed that what was once dormant could be nudged into action with the right approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers emphasize the potential impact for those with tooth agenesis, another term for missing teeth. Many with missing teeth struggle from an early age due to problems with speech and chewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-potential-human-benefits"&gt;Potential human benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials in humans will aim to confirm the therapy’s safety. Takahashi believes an added set of teeth might someday become a realistic option for those who have lost teeth or never formed them in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In any case, we’re hoping to see a time when tooth-regrowth medicine is a third choice alongside dentures and implants,” said Takahashi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dentists typically turn to implants or dentures, which require maintenance and can be uncomfortable. The proposed medication seeks to offer a biological alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-challenges-on-the-road-ahead"&gt;Challenges on the road ahead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safe human testing remains a key goal. Regulatory reviews will be crucial to confirm there are no adverse effects. The team hopes that in six years, regrowing teeth for therapeutic purposes will be a common procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research in genetics has opened possibilities for medicine that once seemed too ambitious. Understanding how to spur a new set of teeth is a major step in combining genetics and dentistry for practical solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shaping-the-future-of-dentistry"&gt;Shaping the future of dentistry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists around the world have been intrigued by similar regenerative procedures. Some labs study &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/154405910408300703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, while others explore chemical triggers for tooth development. The search for a viable therapy has been active for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takahashi’s approach hinges on a well-defined protein target. If successful, it might also encourage the development of treatments for other dental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-it-works"&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medication contains an antibody designed to block USAG-1. When that happens, tooth buds have fewer barriers stopping them from maturing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By directing the body’s &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/what-happens-to-our-teeth-as-we-age-new-details-have-emerged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;natural growth process&lt;/a&gt;, researchers aim to produce strong and fully formed teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hope is that those who never had a complete set can finally grow a replacement. Many doctors see it as a potential game-changer in oral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signs-of-optimism"&gt;Signs of optimism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, missing teeth lead to lifelong issues. Families handle multiple rounds of dental visits for children in need of prosthetics or implants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these trials confirm the safety and effectiveness of the therapy, the days of coping with artificial replacements might become less common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the journey from mouse studies to human trials can be long, Takahashi’s team is excited about the milestone. They view their discovery as a chance to rewrite what is possible for tooth restoration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead"&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research community will watch these clinical trials in Japan to see if the technique can be reliably repeated in people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it works, it may shape a future where anyone could regrow a natural tooth. That prospect alone has generated plenty of curiosity and interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:33:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNdkpPNzAwUFFKdXcwMVpSdEdYdGZRWGVYQUQybU1YdVdoOGZnQjlzT2xQcnplNDFvSEJvbDd2ei10ZHVmQkVkdEJUbVpCYlQwOFkzNXR5bVRNNWNfOFlEUXZtV0tibWtzY0ZjTFhKWUJxT0czMzJfX0lUMmZNWjluVExoeG0tQWlZaUhocEpjMi0xdmR6dHJmRlpLZlhhTEUyc2x6Z01n</guid></item><item><title>一名潜水员参观了一条堕落的鲸鱼。当他回来时，它已经消失了。-《纽约时报》 | A Diver Visited a Fallen Whale.

As he descended, a hulking mass took shape below him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;There, at an exceptionally shallow 115 feet, lay the body of a baby gray whale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Whale falls are usually not seen by human divers. Typically, they are discovered by remotely operated vehicles at depths exceeding 3,000 feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Local marine biologists had a guess as to the gray whale calf’s origins. An animal that matched what was found on the seafloor had been spotted swimming near La Jolla Shores, desperately searching for its mother. During its final hours, it was seen approaching boats, as though asking for help that wasn’t coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Because it was the first time in memory that a fall was so accessible to people, other divers quickly made their way to the site. Among them was Jules Jacobs, an underwater photojournalist who &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/09/science/tuna-crabs-san-diego.html" title=""&gt;has written&lt;/a&gt; for The New York Times about his explorations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;At that point in late January, the carcass’s resting place was a trough in the canyon that required pinpoint precision to reach. So Mr. Jacobs steeled himself for a dangerous and mentally taxing dive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Inattention and anxiety appear to reinforce each other in girls, but not in boys, where hyperactivity is the more predictive factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers emphasize that these findings could improve early diagnosis and intervention for young girls, who are often overlooked due to their quiet or daydreamy demeanor. Early support may prevent later mental health issues, offering a path toward more targeted, sex-specific approaches to ADHD care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender Differences:&lt;/strong&gt; Inattention predicts anxiety in girls, while hyperactivity predicts it in boys.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Undiagnosed ADHD:&lt;/strong&gt; Girls with inattentive-type ADHD are often diagnosed late due to subtler symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Intervention:&lt;/strong&gt; Identifying inattention before age 12 could prevent anxiety later on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;NTNU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) have found new correlations between ADHD and anxiety, which are two major health issues among adolescents. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two disorders often co-occur in individuals, and recent findings now reveal that the relationship between them appears to be different in girls and boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109382"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a girl and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ADHD-anxiety-girls-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The NTNU researchers hope their findings can demonstrate the importance of early detection of ADHD in children. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apparent differences between girls and boys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several types of ADHD, and the researchers’ findings are related to one specific type called the &lt;em&gt;inattentive type&lt;/em&gt;. A higher percentage of girls have this type of ADHD. Boys often have a different type of ADHD called the &lt;em&gt;hyperactive-impulsive type&lt;/em&gt;. Some people can have both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“First and foremost, we have identified a link between anxiety and inattentive type ADHD, and we find that this only applies to girls,” said Professor Lars Wichstrøm at the Department of Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprised by major differences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first time researchers have investigated – and demonstrated – that the relationship between ADHD and anxiety differs according to sex, and that it is linked to inattention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We assumed there were differences between the sexes, but we did not expect them to be so significant,” said Wichstrøm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He emphasizes that they have studied inattention as a symptom of ADHD, rather than ADHD as a disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reciprocal relationship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two disorders seem to reinforce each other. In girls, the prevalence of inattention increases the likelihood of more severe symptoms of anxiety disorders during childhood and adolescence. In addition, anxiety during adolescence increases the likelihood of the inattention worsening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found no such correlation between inattention and anxiety in boys. However, they found that increased hyperactivity-impulsivity in the first few years of school increased the likelihood of developing anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earlier detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders increase significantly during adolescence, especially for girls. The NTNU study concludes that early detection and effective treatment of inattention symptoms in girls can reduce the risk of anxiety later on in life. Similarly, interventions or treatment for anxiety can reduce the likelihood of attention deficit difficulties becoming more severe in young girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is well known that ADHD and anxiety often co-occur in individuals. According to Wichstrøm, only a small part of this comorbidity can be explained by shared genetics between ADHD and anxiety. We also know that the intensity of ADHD symptoms and anxiety can vary over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, we do not know why this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under the radar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, 5 per cent of children and adolescents have ADHD, both in Norway and in other countries where this has been studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety increases significantly in children as early as 12 years old. If we can identify inattention problems before that age, possibly as early as 8 years old, we may be able to reduce or prevent them from developing into anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Girls with inattentive type ADHD are often perceived as shy, introverted, absent-minded and daydreaming – or even lazy. As children, they often go under the radar because they rarely cause any trouble or disturb others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only symptom they have is inattention, and it can be difficult to distinguish this from simply being ‘normally’ distracted, disorganized, or forgetful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missing out on help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that girls often receive the diagnosis later on in life. As a result, they miss out on interventions that might help limit the later development of anxiety, according to Wichstrøm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyperactive-impulsive type ADHD is most prevalent in boys. It is easier to see and hear individuals who struggle with restlessness and hyperactivity, who cannot sit still or wait their turn. Thus, they tend to be identified earlier, receive a diagnosis, and get help more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Struggle and exclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children who struggle with basic skills can experience exclusion, bullying and other stressful challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Personal and social challenges can easily lead to rumination, worry, anxiety and catastrophizing. It seems that girls are more vulnerable when they are exposed to negative life events or bullying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They are more likely to respond with depression than boys,” explained Wichstrøm, who has done extensive research on anxiety and depression among adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADHD is detected through anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers still do not know if there are any common factors underlying and influencing why some individuals develop both anxiety and ADHD. What they do know is that the older an individual is when diagnosed, the more common it is for them to have inattentive type ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Generally, as young people approach puberty, the prevalence of anxiety increases significantly – especially among girls, and it is only at that point that their ADHD is also detected,” explained Wichstrøm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking for early signs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NTNU researchers hope their findings can demonstrate the importance of early detection of ADHD in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anxiety increases significantly in children as early as 12 years old. If we can identify inattention problems before that age, possibly as young as 8 years old, we may be able to reduce or prevent them from developing into anxiety,” said Wichstrøm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NTNU researchers emphasize the need for more knowledge about the intricate connections between sex, ADHD and anxiety. An additional step could be to confirm the findings they have made in an even larger study. Wichstrøm would like to see further research on the very youngest girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helping people with ADHD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wichstrøm is fully aware of the debate about the overdiagnosis of ADHD. He says it is quite possible that too many people may end up with a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But we must still strive to actually detect ADHD where it exists and help those who have it,” he said.Studied 1000 children and their parents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NTNU study is an observational study. It is based on information from 1000 children born in 2003 and 2004 and their parents. The participants have been followed up every other year from the time the children were 4 years old until they turned 18. They are now young adults, turning 22 this autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this ADHD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lars Wichstrøm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NTNU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lars Wichstrøm – NTNU&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.14038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Reciprocal relations between dimensions of attention-deficit/hyperactivity and anxiety disorders from preschool age to adolescence: sex differences in a birth cohort sample&lt;/a&gt;” by Lars Wichstrøm et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reciprocal relations between dimensions of attention-deficit/hyperactivity and anxiety disorders from preschool age to adolescence: sex differences in a birth cohort sample&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jcpp14038-sec-0001-title"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of anxiety and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are prospectively related from childhood to adolescence. However, whether the two dimensions of ADHD—inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity—are differentially related to anxiety and whether there are developmental and sex/gender differences in these relations are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jcpp14038-sec-0002-title"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two birth cohorts of Norwegian children were assessed biennially from ages 4 to 16 (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 1,077; 49% girls) with diagnostic parent interviews used to assess symptoms of anxiety and ADHD. Data were analyzed using a random intercept cross-lagged panel model, adjusting for all unobserved time-invariant confounding effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jcpp14038-sec-0003-title"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In girls, increased inattention, but not hyperactivity-impulsivity, predicted increased anxiety 2 years later across all time-points and increased anxiety at ages 12 and 14 predicted increased inattention but not hyperactivity-impulsivity. In boys, increased hyperactivity-impulsivity at ages 6 and 8, but not increased inattention, predicted increased anxiety 2 years later, whereas increased anxiety did not predict increased inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jcpp14038-sec-0004-title"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two ADHD dimensions were differentially related to anxiety, and the relations were sex-specific. In girls, inattention may be involved in the development of anxiety throughout childhood and adolescence and anxiety may contribute to girls developing more inattention beginning in early adolescence. In boys, hyperactivity-impulsivity may be involved in the development of anxiety during the early school years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective treatment of inattention symptoms in girls may reduce anxiety risk at all time-points, while addressing anxiety may decrease inattention during adolescence. Similarly, treating hyperactivity-impulsivity may reduce anxiety risk in boys during late childhood (at ages 8–10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 15:29:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE85RHM5M1pMWDQ1WkRzRkxuek5LOFkwSkY0RktCb1MxaWRxY21RVHVWS1dSMGNUU2tSVS1EUV9iOGV3OTJSRXhENVNJSmY2eFRURVV2eEpPbjhFZXF6cTdoaFJjV1g</guid></item><item><title>由营养师创建的7天高蛋白抗炎膳食计划，以改善血糖- EatingWell | 7-Day High-Protein Anti-Inflammatory Meal Plan for Better Blood Sugar, Created by a Dietitian - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNTXN6MTQxMi1uZWxZX0Q4UDBoNjFVTFI4RXhKbjFrTXlCV19UYTB2UWpVTGZIVmFNNVBGQWdXcVNoQlI3VVBXVzR1TjV2bXJPZXhzXzlQbVVEUmlMRG5tMWhzS0dibXVKVFk4Vm95d2xNMjVMbDFBWkU2MHY3NFI4dFpvSFNSWGpOdjk2OEVWQzdZWG9KWXVEYlFyN3FHaXM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-table__table-wrapper"&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;​​Is it OK to mix and match meals if there is one I do not like?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, if there’s a meal you don’t like, feel free to substitute it with a different meal in this plan or browse all of our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/17899/health-condition/diabetic/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diabetes-friendly recipes&lt;/a&gt;. We aimed for about 40 to 50 grams of high-fiber carbohydrates per meal to support stable blood sugar levels, so a simple swap should work for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item " data-ordinal="2"&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it’s easier for your routine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day, go for it! Each meal is fairly similar in carbohydrate content and total calories, so making a swap should work for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item " data-ordinal="3"&gt;

&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item " data-ordinal="4"&gt;

&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Should I cut back on carbohydrates?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been told you have high blood sugar levels or are looking to reduce your risk, you may think you need to cut back drastically on carbohydrates. However, that’s often not necessary or sustainable long-term. Many carbohydrates, such as whole-grains, legumes and fruits, contain fiber, which is a beneficial nutrient for healthy blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Instead, focusing on fiber-rich carbs and reducing refined grains and added sugars can be an effective strategy. For more individual recommendations, consider reaching out to a registered dietitian for guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_180-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-this-meal-plan-may-benefit-blood-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_181-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How This Meal Plan May Benefit Blood Sugar: &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_182-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follows the Anti-Inflammatory Diet: &lt;/strong&gt;To support healthy blood sugar levels, we include the principles of the anti-inflammatory diet. Research shows that following an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/category/4243/anti-inflammatory-diet-center/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory diet&lt;/a&gt; may lower blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; An anti-inflammatory diet focuses on nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains, seafood and a wide-array of healthy fats, such as nuts, olive oil and avocado. It limits refined grains, processed foods with minimal nutritional value and added sugars. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Protein with Moderately-Low Carbohydrate:&lt;/strong&gt; To support healthy blood sugar levels, we opted for a moderately-low carbohydrate level of about 40% of daily total calories and spread the carbohydrates out fairly evenly between the day’s meals and snacks to support stable blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While there’s no one-size-fits all recommendation for the amount of carbohydrates a person should eat per day, there are some nutrition strategies that may help support healthy blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These strategies include reducing total carbohydrates, emphasizing high-fiber carbohydrates and including plenty of protein.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Each day provides at least 103 grams of protein and 33 grams of fiber in this blood sugar-friendly plan. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart-Healthy: &lt;/strong&gt;Having type 2 diabetes can increase the risk of developing heart disease, so we made this plan with both blood sugar and heart health in mind.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To support a healthy heart, we capped saturated fat at 14 grams per day (with an upper limit of 20 grams on days we include fatty fish, like salmon) and capped the sodium at 2,300 milligrams per day, as recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Far from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“In the field of consciousness, there are already so many theories that we don’t need more theories,” said Oscar Ferrante, a neuroscientist at the University of Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you’re looking for a theory to explain how our brains give rise to subjective, inner experiences, you can check out Adaptive Resonance Theory. Or consider Dynamic Core Theory. Don’t forget First Order Representational Theory, not to mention semantic pointer competition theory. The list goes on: A 2021 survey identified &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/11/5/535" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;29 different theories of consciousness.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Dr. Ferrante belongs to a group of scientists who want to lower that number, perhaps even down to just one. But they face a steep challenge, thanks to how scientists often study consciousness: Devise a theory, run experiments to build evidence for it, and argue that it’s better than the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“We are not incentivized to kill our own ideas,” said Lucia Melloni, a neuroscientist at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics in Frankfurt, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Seven years ago, Dr. Melloni and 41 other scientists embarked on a major study on consciousness that she hoped would break this pattern. Their plan was to bring together two rival groups to design an experiment to see how well both theories did at predicting what happens in our brains during a conscious experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p&gt;Behind the gleam of blinking screens, scientists at the Allen Institute for Brain Science staged one of the most intriguing confrontations in science. The goal was to uncover what makes us conscious — what transforms light bouncing off a tree or the sound of a bird into the rich and subjective experience of waking life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To achieve this mission, since 2018, the scientists have been testing two of the most influential theories about the rise of consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seven years later, the results are in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings offer no final verdict on the nature of consciousness. But they deal a blow to both of the leading theories — Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) — while providing new clues about how the brain transforms sensory input into the experience of being.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Adversarial collaboration fits within the Allen Institute’s mission of team science, open science and big science, in service of one of the biggest, and most long-standing, intellectual challenges of humanity: the Mind-Body Problem,” said &lt;a href="https://alleninstitute.org/person/christof-koch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Christof Koch&lt;/a&gt;, meritorious investigator at the Allen Institute. “Unravelling this mystery is the passion of my entire life.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-two-theories-one-conscious-mind"&gt;Two Theories, One Conscious Mind&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two theories try to explain the origin of consciousness in strikingly different ways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IIT, spearheaded by Italian neuroscientist &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulio_Tononi"&gt;Giulio Tononi&lt;/a&gt;, claims consciousness arises from how much information a system integrates within itself. According to IIT, the “hot zone” for this process lies in the back of the brain — the posterior cortex — where networks supposedly weave together the web of experience. But according to IIT, it is not &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; the activity happens that matters, but &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; deeply it is integrated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GNWT, championed by French cognitive neuroscientist &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislas_Dehaene"&gt;Stanislas Dehaene&lt;/a&gt;, argues that consciousness emerges when information becomes globally accessible across a network of brain regions — a kind of neural spotlight, centered largely in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), that brings thoughts and perceptions into awareness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study began as an “adversarial collaboration” — a relatively rare scientific arrangement in which theorists with opposing views agree to a shared experiment, using standardized methods and blinded analyses. The goal is to reduce bias and settle long-standing debates not with words, but with data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 2019 experiment tested both theories head-to-head. Involving 256 adult participants — a record-breaking number of people for this type of brain study—the research team used visual stimuli and a combination of brain imaging tools: functional MRI to track blood flow, EEG to capture electrical activity, and MEG to measure magnetic fields. These tools allowed them to observe the brain as it responded to conscious and unconscious visual experiences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers laid out three critical predictions where IIT and GNWT would clash:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where in the brain is conscious content represented?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How is it maintained over time?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Which regions synchronize to support it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants viewed suprathreshold visual stimuli—faces, letters, objects, even fake symbols—presented at different angles and for different durations. They were asked to detect rare targets, but most of the time, they simply watched as their brains were scanned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What this allowed was a full-spectrum view of the brain’s dance—from millisecond-level flickers of electric fields to broad patterns of blood flow — capturing consciousness from multiple angles at once.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-adversarial-collaboration"&gt;Adversarial Collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results didn’t hand victory to either theory. Both IIT and GNWT got some things right — and some very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was clear that no single experiment would decisively refute either theory,” said Anil Seth, a professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience at the University of Sussex and one of the study’s co-authors. “The theories are just too different in their assumptions and explanatory goals, and the available experimental methods too coarse, to enable one theory to conclusively win out over another.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, conscious content could be decoded in both the posterior cortex and the prefrontal cortex, aligning with both theories. But when it came to more detailed aspects like the orientation of a face, the prefrontal cortex came up short. That was a problem for GNWT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, IIT predicted that conscious content would be maintained in the back of the brain for as long as a stimulus was visible. The evidence here was mixed. Some neural signatures in the posterior cortex did track stimulus duration, but only a minority of electrodes showed this sustained activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even more damaging was the failure to find sustained synchronization within posterior regions — the key claim of IIT. Connectivity was brief and patchy, not the continuous integration the theory calls for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And GNWT? It fared no better on its own turf.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The theory predicted distinct bursts — or “ignitions” — in the prefrontal cortex at both the beginning and end of a conscious experience. But those offset ignitions were missing. Though the prefrontal cortex lit up when a stimulus appeared, it stayed mostly quiet when it vanished.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Much has been learned about both theories and about where and when in the brain information about visual experience can be decoded from,” said Seth. “Having said all this, the findings of the collaboration remain extremely valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-model-for-investigating-consciousness"&gt;A New Model for Investigating Consciousness&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The greatest achievement of the study may not lie in what it found, but in &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it was done. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike typical neuroscience studies — often conducted by a small team aiming to support a hypothesis — this effort was born of open science. The predictions were publicly registered in advance. The experiments were replicated across labs and technologies. The theory proponents themselves stepped back from data analysis to reduce bias.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was a scientific duel, but it was fought with mutual respect and transparency. This isn’t the end of the road for either theory, but it is a recalibration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Adversarial collaborations are a powerful social process, little used because of its challenging nature,” Koch added. “But it requires a great deal of cooperation and work.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maybe consciousness isn’t located strictly in the front or the back of the brain. Maybe it doesn’t live in bursts or seamless continuity. Perhaps it’s more like a shifting mosaic, stitched together by fleeting alignments of neural activity. More studies are already underway. The next confrontations may involve animal models, higher resolution brain scans, or radically new theories altogether.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications go beyond the philosophical. They may help doctors detect signs of consciousness in patients who appear unresponsive, such as those in comas or vegetative states. In 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/one-four-brain-injured-unresponsive-patients-shows-signs-hidden-consciousness"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; study&lt;/a&gt; estimated that up to 25% of such patients may retain “covert consciousness,” detectable only with brain scans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the mind remains mysterious. But now, it has fewer places to hide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings appeared in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08888-1"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Those are the areas your parents always made sure you washed growing up, after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But there’s one often-overlooked body part that deserves just as much attention. And chances are, you’re not washing it properly without even realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The body part in question? Your feet.

They're the perfect breeding ground for bacteria, especially with all the moisture from sweaty socks. Add in the dirt and grime from walking barefoot, and it’s a recipe for trouble. If you skip washing your feet or don't wash them properly, it's basically an open invitation for multiple bacterial and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1140198/ericasweeney/home-remedies-foot-fungus/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fungal infections;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;fungal infections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/often-really-shower-202248112.html" data-ylk="slk:How Often Do You Really Need to Shower? ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Often Do You &lt;em&gt;Really&lt;/em&gt; Need to Shower? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How Dirty Are Your Feet, Really?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you could zoom in on your feet with a microscope, you’d see tiny germs all over, though that depends on how often (and well) you wash your feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In one &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/18/3503" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, scientists swabbed the soles of volunteers and found some eye-opening results. People who washed their feet had about 8,800 bacteria per square centimeter of skin. However, when they &lt;em&gt;skipped &lt;/em&gt;washing, that number skyrocketed to a million bacteria per square centimeter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If these statistics don't knock you off your (hopefully now clean) feet, here's another. Researchers made headlines years ago when they were the first to study how much fungus lives on the feet. Their findings? Nearly &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12171" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:200 fungal species;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;200 fungal species&lt;/a&gt; live on the feet.

"You have several thousand sweat glands on the soles of your feet, so you are basically inviting bacteria to grow and live on the skin."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, of course, there are millions of bacteria and fungi all over the human body. The mouth, for example, has about 700 different microbes crawling around. Some germs have a symbiotic relationship with the human body, where they protect the body from more harmful microorganisms in exchange for shelter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jocd.13368" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:foot is no exception;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;foot is no exception&lt;/a&gt;. The problem lies in the number of infection-causing germs that accumulate when you don't wash your feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What Happens When You Don't Wash Your Feet Every Day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Feet get dirty easily, even when they're covered in socks. Sometimes &lt;em&gt;because &lt;/em&gt;they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"They’re enclosed in socks and shoes for hours at a time, creating a warm, moist environment that’s perfect for bacteria and fungi to thrive," Dr. Kopelman explains. "Plus, they’re constantly exposed to sweat, dead skin and, depending on your activities, dirt and grime. If you don't actively wash your feet, all of that can build up over time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When you don't take proper care of your feet, you open the door to fungal infections like athlete’s foot and the bacteria that cause smelly feet. Worse, if bacteria slip into your bloodstream through a cut or cracked skin, it can lead to even more serious infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"At a high level this is pretty inconsequential, outside of maybe having to deal with odor or unsightliness. It only takes one small crack in the skin for this bacteria to go deep enough to affect your joints and bone health," says Dr. Haghverdian. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/heres-exactly-happens-body-dont-012500414.html" data-ylk="slk:What Happens When You Don't Clean Your Belly Button;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;What Happens When You Don't Clean Your Belly Button&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How To Wash Your Feet the Right Way&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I hate to break it to you, but chances are, you're probably not washing your feet correctly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"A lot of people assume that because the water from the shower runs down their body and hits their feet, that’s enough to keep them clean," Dr. Kopelman says. "But in reality, that's not true. Feet need direct attention just like any other part of the body."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even if you skip a shower, Dr. Kopelman says people should ideally still give their feet a quick scrub with soap and water, explaining, "It doesn't have to be complicated. A quick clean, followed by drying them well, can go a long way toward keeping your skin healthy and reducing odor or infection risk." If you're active, prone to sweating or often wear closed-toe shoes, washing your feet daily should be a top priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Don't forget to scrub between your toes when you wash your feet, either. "I always recommend spending a few extra moments in the shower to actually scrub your feet with soap, paying special attention to between the toes, and making sure to rinse and dry them thoroughly afterward," Dr. Kopelman adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/wash-face-dermatologist-straight-board-210000238.html" data-ylk="slk:How to Wash Your Face Like a Dermatologist ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;How to Wash Your Face Like a Dermatologist &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Foot self-care tips&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While unnecessary, if you want to pamper your feet, try using foot masks and exfoliators. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"If you have thickened skin, calluses, or get a lot of dry, rough areas on your feet, then using a gentle exfoliating product like a pumice stone, a urea-based cream or an occasional foot peel helps keep the skin smooth and healthy," Dr. Kopelman says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Depending on your skin type, Dr. Kopelman says using these products once or twice a week is enough to refresh your feet. Anything more can cause tiny cracks or irritation that make your feet more vulnerable to infection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now stop dragging your heels and wash those feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/youll-never-guess-shower-product-202500357.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: You'll Never Guess What Shower Product Dermatologists Say You Should Ditch ASAP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: You'll Never Guess What Shower Product Dermatologists Say You Should Ditch ASAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 14:48:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPOVllUG1MSGZFZVRNR0doVE9yLWhVem1NdF9QdEdtUlRSU3BBOW9UMkpHbTVoSmFtbzNWQlJPR0xQa25tOTMxS05qcm9rWjlQZ29QcG1sNVZSZmpQMnJTbnluRXJ6ZzJWSGJNTmw4Uy1LUzlrenRqRW9PclhWdms3ZVEzQQ</guid></item><item><title>新一代软外骨骼增强脑瘫儿童的行动能力-神经科学新闻 | Next-Gen Soft Exoskeleton Boosts Mobility for Kids With Cerebral Palsy - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTFB0YWRUUlU5d1ZhRU5pUmVZWnhXZTNwdVdxM3RnUkVvYXNXdVVLMW1TWnRsc3d2WU9ta05LY3hpdlgzRzFmRGstMlhUdVlnY19nRWpYSXo1U2poSE9zQ0JieDZraF9NR3N5Sl9TNllJOGxIOTRKUFE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have developed the MyoStep, a next-generation soft exoskeleton designed to help children with cerebral palsy walk more easily and safely.

By integrating cutting edge technologies such as artificial muscles, smart fabrics, and a comprehensive sensor network, MyoStep offers a promising solution to the challenges faced by existing exoskeletons.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need for exoskeletons that promote healthy musculoskeletal development and can adjust as children grow prompted Contreras-Vidal to convene a cross-disciplinary team with clinical partner Gerard Francisco, MD, professor and The Wulfe Family Chair of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at UTHealth Houston and medical officer at TIRR Memorial Hermann.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team includes experts in biomechanics and orthopedic surgery (Christopher J. Arellano, University of Arizona), medical officer at TIRR Memorial Hermann and from the IUCRC BRAIN at the University of Houston: costume design and technology (Paige A. Willson), industrial design (Elham Morshedzadeh and Jeff Feng), mechanical engineering (Francisco C. Robles Hernandez, and Zheng Chen) and electrical engineering students (Shantanu Sarkar, Aime J. Aguilar-Herrera, and Lara Altaweel). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research represents a groundbreaking step forward in how we think about mobility and independence for children with cerebral palsy,” said Francisco.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovations in mobility &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tailored the MyoStep to be lightweight, discreet and tailored to fit seamlessly into the lives of children and their families. The wireless sensor network, embedded inside the smart and flexible fabrics, is the backbone of the suit, collecting and sending real-time data about the user’s movements so the device knows when to assist their arms or legs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also includes safety features such as temperature monitoring and emergency shut-off mechanisms.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All electronics and actuators are fully isolated from the user’s skin to prevent direct contact and reduce the risk of irritation or discomfort. Integrated temperature sensors continuously monitor the device’s surface temperature, automatically deactivating the system if it exceeds safe limits to protect against overheating or burns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The various sensors in the network communicate with each other using Bluetooth technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What makes the MyoStep project so compelling is that it’s not just about the technology: it’s about restoring confidence, function, and hope. This kind of innovation has the potential to dramatically improve quality of life, helping children move through the world with greater ease and dignity,” said Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next steps &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coordination across the ankle, knee and hip was vital in producing the prototype. Continually improving how the ankle moves could make walking more efficient, allowing children to use less energy to walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The team is currently focused on enhancing ankle movement control using artificial muscles made from advanced smart materials, such as shape memory alloys, which contract with temperature changes and dielectric elastomers which respond to voltage,” said Contreras-Vidal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These actuators work in conjunction with a multimodal sensor network, including EMG sensors to monitor muscle activations, and inertial measurement units to detect gait phases and joint angles.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscles have been investigated for decades, but their actual behavior has not been successfully replicated with lightweight systems.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To make this possible, there is a need for interdisciplinary systems and disciplines to fully execute the physics of muscle gesticulations,” said Contreras-Vidal.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work has been supported in part by the IEEE Electron Device Society’s Humanitarian Fund. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurotech research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#771b16111e141c1a161937021f59121302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Laurie Fickman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uh.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Houston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Laurie Fickman – University of Houston&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;IEEE Electron Devices Magazin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;e&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 14:46:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFB0YWRUUlU5d1ZhRU5pUmVZWnhXZTNwdVdxM3RnUkVvYXNXdVVLMW1TWnRsc3d2WU9ta05LY3hpdlgzRzFmRGstMlhUdVlnY19nRWpYSXo1U2poSE9zQ0JieDZraF9NR3N5Sl9TNllJOGxIOTRKUFE</guid></item><item><title>肯尼迪建议新父母“自己做疫苗研究” --《纽约时报》 | Kennedy Advises New Parents to ‘Do Your Own Research’ on Vaccines - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxOQ0RKSWJuM0lFMTk5V3FxaFRQbFdvMFBuNjc4R0dCQlZ2ZzVCU1F1dDJSZEpjcjRHREZlY3FPMzR5eWtlOHppcFRId21oNVdJbXRSYmswUFZMVG1IZVdNYW1KMm10ZDdmY2VfRXJCdFN6aHFoWXExMzJLMGZDekJTMlRiTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. advised parents of newborns to “do your own research” before vaccinating their infants during a televised interview in which he also suggested the measles shot was unsafe and repeatedly made false statements that cast doubt on the benefits of vaccination and the independence of the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Kennedy made the remarks to the talk show host Dr. Phil &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZofNzZ8UoPk" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;in an interview&lt;/a&gt; that aired Monday on MeritTV to mark the 100th day of the Trump administration. He said, as he has in the past, that “if you want to avoid spreading measles, the best thing you can do is take that vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But Mr. Kennedy also made clear, as he has in the past, that he believes it is up to individuals to decide. In suggesting vaccines are unsafe, he contradicted decades of advice from public health experts, including leaders of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I would say that we live in a democracy, and part of the responsibility of being a parent is to do your own research,” the health secretary said, in response to a question from a woman in the audience who asked how he would advise a new parent about vaccine safety. “You research the baby stroller, you research the foods that they’re getting, and you need to research the medicines that they’re taking as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The phrase “I did my own research” became a cultural and political touchstone during the coronavirus pandemic, when proponents of vaccination, mostly on the political left, used it to denigrate those who had chosen not to get vaccinated.

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/diabetes/" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Diabetes&lt;/a&gt; deaths in the U.S. have fallen to some of the lowest rates in years, according to new preliminary figures published by the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention/" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, reversing a surge in mortality that was seen during the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/coronavirus/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 26.4 deaths per 100,000 people from diabetes, according to early death certificate &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/mortality-dashboard.htm#" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; for the third quarter of 2024 published this month by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Death rates from diabetes peaked in 2021, according to CDC &lt;a href="http://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D158/D434F595" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;figures&lt;/a&gt;, at 31.1 deaths per 100,000 people for that year. Diabetes was the eighth leading &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr73/nvsr73-08.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;cause of death&lt;/a&gt; in 2021. The CDC says the link between COVID-19 and diabetes may be to blame for that increase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Data show an increase in mortality rates for all people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and research shows that people with underlying conditions, including diabetes, are more likely to become very sick from COVID-19 and have a higher risk of hospitalization and death," Christopher Holliday, head of the CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation, told CBS News in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holliday added that research shows the pandemic may also have made it harder for Americans to properly manage the disease, ranging from interruptions to physical activity to disruptions to routine medical care diagnosing and treating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While diabetes-related death rates have decreased since 2021, they have not returned to pre-pandemic levels," Holliday said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 103,294 deaths from diabetes in 2021, up more than 17% from 87,647 deaths in 2019 before the pandemic. Provisional &lt;a href="http://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D176/D434F599" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; reported so far for 2024 have tallied 94,294 diabetes deaths last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes deaths had been largely falling in recent years before the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an increase in the prevalence of the disease. Those trends were before the introduction of new diabetes treatments like Ozempic and Mounjaro that have seen &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-declares-end-to-wegovy-and-ozempic-shortage/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;high demand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 1 in 10 adults had diagnosed diabetes &lt;a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/NHISDataQueryTool/SHS_adult/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;in 2023&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC's National Health Interview Survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK568010/#ch36.s7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;caution&lt;/a&gt; that analyzing long term trends in diabetes deaths is complex for a number of reasons, including changes in the definition of the disease over the past decades and variation in how death certificates record diabetes deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, not all death certificates record diabetes as the main "underlying cause of death" but instead as a contributing factor, which is counted separately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Diabetes is a more common contributing cause of death, not the primary underlying cause of death. Furthermore, most deaths among people with diabetes are cardiovascular and would be counted among the cardiovascular," &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1882/elizabeth-selvin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Elizabeth Selvin&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Johns Hopkins Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research, said in an email to CBS News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selvin said it is up to doctors to choose whether to select diabetes or other underlying health conditions as the cause of a heart attack death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of this to say, trends in underlying causes of death will reflect awareness of diabetes and coding practices; It is hard to know what role these play in these data," Selvin said.&lt;/p&gt;

Experts say yes. “Vitamin D is an essential nutrient and has powerful antioxidant benefits—having a direct effect on so many of our bodily functions, organs, and overall health,” says &lt;a href="https://bznutritionny.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://bznutritionny.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Brigitte Zeitlin" data-node-id="7.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Brigitte Zeitlin&lt;/a&gt;, RD, a certified nutritionist and founder of BZ Nutrition. If you're feeling low-energy, vitamin D can also give you a boost, Zeitlin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Along with improving immune function and preventing &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g19922804/foods-that-fight-cold-and-flu/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g19922804/foods-that-fight-cold-and-flu/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="colds and infections" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;colds and infections&lt;/a&gt;, vitamin D can also promote healthy bones and teeth by helping our bodies absorb calcium, reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by regulating blood sugar levels, and even lower the chance of developing certain cancers by lowering body inflammation, Zeitlin says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“There is also research to suggest that vitamin D plays a role in improving mood and mental health by reducing &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a40990916/how-i-finally-found-a-way-to-manage-my-anxiety/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a40990916/how-i-finally-found-a-way-to-manage-my-anxiety/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="anxiety" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a45500132/postpartum-depression-treatment-future/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a45500132/postpartum-depression-treatment-future/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="depression" data-node-id="9.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, as vitamin D decreases inflammation in the brain,” Zeitlin says, acknowledging a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9468237/#:~:text=In%20the%20meta%2Danalysis%20of,4000%20IU%20for%20%E2%89%A5%208" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9468237/#:~:text=In%20the%20meta%2Danalysis%20of,4000%20IU%20for%20%E2%89%A5%208" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="recent study" data-node-id="9.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). All this to say, vitamin D could be a small, but powerful way to help you reach your health goals—both physical &lt;em data-node-id="9.7"&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; mental. &lt;em data-node-id="9.9"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="when-is-the-best-time-to-take-vitamin-d" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;When Is The Best Time To Take Vitamin D? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="body-text css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;There is no magic, universal time when everyone should take vitamin D. However, experts generally recommend taking it in the morning, ideally with breakfast or your first meal of the day. “For a lot of people, it’s convenient to take vitamin D—or any vitamin—in the morning,” Cording says. “It can become a part of your daily getting-ready ritual.” You can keep the supp next to your coffee maker or even have a stash at work so you remember to take one, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Taking vitamin D later in the day may not be as effective if you want to reap the full benefits, and some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23665342/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23665342/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="evidence" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests that it may negatively impact your sleep. “Limited evidence suggests that it may affect melatonin production,” says Sonya Angelone, RD, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition Dietetics. “I haven’t seen it to be a problem when taken before bed, however, I don’t usually recommend taking supplements before bedtime." &lt;br data-node-id="12.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Ultimately, vitamin D works best when taken with food and water, so you may want to plan your supplementation around meal time. “Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, which means your body uses what it needs at the moment and then stores the rest in your fat cells—so your body will pull the vitamin D out of your fat cells when it needs it during the day,” Zeitlin explains.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.ccjm.org/content/89/3/154" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ccjm.org/content/89/3/154" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Research" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; studies have &lt;a href="https://www.jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(14)01468-3/abstract" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(14)01468-3/abstract" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="consistently shown" data-node-id="15.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;consistently shown&lt;/a&gt; that vitamin D increases blood levels better when taken with a fat-containing meal," Angelone adds. So, take your supp with a scoop of peanut butter—or better yet, a full breakfast—for max impact.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-should-take-vitamin-d" data-node-id="16" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;Who Should Take Vitamin D? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If you’re considering a vitamin D supplement, it’s a good idea to ask your doctor for a blood test to make sure that your levels are, in fact, low, says Angelone. “It is important to check your blood level of vitamin D before supplementing so you know just how much to take,” she adds. A circulating level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D greater than 30 ng/mL is required to maintain a healthy level of vitamin D, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532266/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532266/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="per the NIH" data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;per the NIH&lt;/a&gt;—so if you're lower than that, your doc may suggest a supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Vitamin D can also be beneficial if you're pregnant or breastfeeding (but always get your doc's approval first). “Women who are breastfeeding should consider higher doses of like 5,000 units daily, as opposed to the original 600 units, and then you won’t have to supplement baby with vitamin D separately,” Zeitlin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If you deal with frequent mood swings, energy loss, fatigue, anxiety, and/or depression, vitamin D supplementation may be helpful, Zeitlin says. However, it's not an overnight fix or substitute for medication. “Adding vitamin D into your routine can help reduce the severity of your symptoms and if you are taking any medication, speak with your doctor before adding in any supplements," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-get-more-vitamin-d" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;How To Get More Vitamin D &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Most people can get vitamin D from food sources like cod liver oil, trout, salmon, and mushrooms, says &lt;a href="https://kerigansny.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://kerigansny.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Keri Gans" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Keri Gans&lt;/a&gt;, RD, author of &lt;em data-node-id="21.3"&gt;The Small Change Diet&lt;/em&gt;. But if you have a lack of vitamin D in your diet, it may be wise to take a daily supplement. This is especially true for vegans, vegetarians, and folks who don't eat as many animal products, Gans says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Another easy way to up your vitamin D levels? Go outdoors. “The more time you spend in the sun, the more vitamin D you get,” Zeitlin says. “But also just the act of the sun on your face, breathing in fresh air, can help improve your mood and mental well-being. It’s hard to tease out the difference—is it the sun or is it the vitamin D? Either way, it’s a win-win.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="best-vitamin-d-supplements" data-node-id="23" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;Best Vitamin D Supplements &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div data-embed="embed-gallery" data-lazy-id="P0-11" data-node-id="24" class="embed css-0 e1ghppmw21"&gt;&lt;div class="css-117i6qr e1ghppmw18"&gt;&lt;div class="css-tiqbpf e1ghppmw20"&gt;&lt;div class="css-1bdrxq9 e1ghppmw16"&gt;&lt;div data-ad-exclude="(min-width: 90rem)" data-embed="embed-product" data-theme-key="embedded-product-wrapper" size="large" class="size-large align-center embed css-me9690 e1ydkxnk0"&gt;&lt;p id="product-40586118-dadf-4855-90a1-d08755ae2929" data-anchor-id="product-40586118-dadf-4855-90a1-d08755ae2929" class="css-17pp2fn e1ydkxnk1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div size="large" class="align-center css-0 ebgq4gw4"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-theme-key="base-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001UZPY1O?tag=womenshealth-auto-20" aria-label="$9 at Amazon for High Potency Vitamin D-3" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001UZPY1O" data-product-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001UZPY1O" data-affiliate="true" data-affiliate-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001UZPY1O?tag=womenshealth-auto-20" data-affiliate-network='{"site_id":"6b499c58-dc46-4f93-80b3-25265395e77a","metadata":{"links":{"default":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001UZPY1O?tag=womenshealth-auto-20","sem":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001UZPY1O?tag=wh-lift-20","social":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001UZPY1O?tag=wh-soc-lift-20"}},"network":{"name":"Amazon"},"product_metadata":null,"afflink_redirect":"/_p/afflink/cTqb/amazon-now-supplements-vitamin-d-3-2000"}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$9 at Amazon" data-vars-ga-media-role="1" data-vars-ga-media-type="Embedded Gallery List" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001UZPY1O" data-vars-ga-product-brand="NOW" data-vars-ga-product-id="40586118-dadf-4855-90a1-d08755ae2929" data-vars-ga-product-price="$8.90" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="5f1a3cdb-8b08-44c0-acd8-14e286583507" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="NOW" data-vars-ga-gallery-display="list" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | On Sale" data-vars-ga-sku="B001UZPY1O" data-vars-ga-magento-tracking="1" class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-g6od0w e1c1bym14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="css-1kpik7c ebgq4gw3"&gt;&lt;div size="large" class="css-19is6rd ebgq4gw1"&gt;&lt;h6 class="css-wziefo e1bddzxd0"&gt;NOW High Potency Vitamin D-3&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p class="css-12k1hqd e1uq555e0"&gt;Now 48% Off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption-embedded-gallery" class="css-1am3yn9 e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1xs3or1 e1geg53v2"&gt;Credit: Amazon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-optimizely="product-dek-container" data-theme-key="embedded-product-description" class="css-w7e3be exai5wx0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 26,000 customers on Amazon have rated this supplement at 4.8 stars, with some users claiming they saw immediate changes in their overall demeanor and even their appearance. This brand is the perfect choice for someone who is looking to decrease the amount of pills they take each day, says Zeitlin. “You can find a NOW pill that has both vitamin D and other vitamins and minerals combined into one pill," she says. "They also make a chewable version, if swallowing is tough." Another green flag? It’s highly affordable, ringing in at just $8 for a 240-count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-tiqbpf e1ghppmw20"&gt;&lt;div class="css-1bdrxq9 e1ghppmw16"&gt;&lt;div data-ad-exclude="(min-width: 90rem)" data-embed="embed-product" data-theme-key="embedded-product-wrapper" size="large" class="size-large align-center embed css-me9690 e1ydkxnk0"&gt;&lt;p id="product-00207b69-80a9-424d-83e9-65c1c75e13ee" data-anchor-id="product-00207b69-80a9-424d-83e9-65c1c75e13ee" class="css-17pp2fn e1ydkxnk1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div size="large" class="align-center css-0 ebgq4gw4"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-theme-key="base-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JAT318?tag=womenshealth-auto-20" aria-label="$21 at Amazon for Vitamin Code Raw D3" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JAT318" data-product-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JAT318" data-affiliate="true" data-affiliate-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JAT318?tag=womenshealth-auto-20" data-affiliate-network='{"site_id":"6b499c58-dc46-4f93-80b3-25265395e77a","metadata":{"links":{"default":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JAT318?tag=womenshealth-auto-20","sem":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JAT318?tag=wh-lift-20","social":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JAT318?tag=wh-soc-lift-20"}},"network":{"name":"Amazon"},"product_metadata":null,"afflink_redirect":"/_p/afflink/cTyM/amazon-garden-of-life-vitamin-d"}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$21 at Amazon" data-vars-ga-media-role="1" data-vars-ga-media-type="Embedded Gallery List" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005JAT318" data-vars-ga-product-brand="Garden of Life" data-vars-ga-product-id="00207b69-80a9-424d-83e9-65c1c75e13ee" data-vars-ga-product-price="$20.99" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="8d47b903-32ab-47de-8d7a-934acd5c80de" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Garden of Life" data-vars-ga-gallery-display="list" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | On Sale" data-vars-ga-sku="B005JAT318" data-vars-ga-magento-tracking="1" class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-g6od0w e1c1bym14"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="css-1kpik7c ebgq4gw3"&gt;&lt;div size="large" class="css-19is6rd ebgq4gw1"&gt;&lt;h6 class="css-wziefo e1bddzxd0"&gt;Garden of Life Vitamin Code Raw D3&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p class="css-12k1hqd e1uq555e0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption-embedded-gallery" class="css-1am3yn9 e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1xs3or1 e1geg53v2"&gt;Credit: Amazon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-optimizely="product-dek-container" data-theme-key="embedded-product-description" class="css-w7e3be exai5wx0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This once-daily formula contains 5,000 IU of fat-soluble vitamin D3. “What I love about Garden of Life is that it also has probiotics mixed in, so you get a boost of gut health with your vitamin D,” Zeitlin says. In addition to being gluten-free and kosher, it's also "RAW"—meaning it was produced without the high heat, synthetic binders, fillers, artificial flavors, sweeteners, colors, or additives commonly used in tablets. You can even open the capsule and mix it with juice or water for a yummy formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-tiqbpf e1ghppmw20"&gt;&lt;div

The compound was well tolerated, with only mild side effects, and benefits persisted for weeks after dosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study was primarily designed to test safety, researchers observed meaningful and lasting improvements in multiple symptoms. The findings suggest psilocybin may enhance neuroplasticity and reduce inflammation, helping the brain heal itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustained Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Improvements in mood, cognition, and movement lasted for weeks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safe and Well Tolerated:&lt;/strong&gt; Mild side effects reported, but no serious adverse events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Phase:&lt;/strong&gt; A larger, multi-site trial will explore underlying mechanisms like neuroplasticity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psilocybin, a natural compound found in certain mushrooms, has shown promise in treating depression and anxiety.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UC San Francisco researchers wanted to know if it could be used to help Parkinson’s patients who often experience debilitating mood dysfunction in addition to their motor symptoms and don’t respond well to antidepressants or other medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109366"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person sitting and mushrooms." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psilocybin-parkinsons-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Another theory is that psilocybin could provide relief from multiple symptoms of the disease by reducing inflammation and promoting neuroplasticity – the growth and reconnection of brain cells involved in mood, cognition, and movement regulation. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did participants tolerate the drug without serious side effects or worsening symptoms, which is what the pilot study was designed to test, they also experienced clinically significant improvements in mood, cognition, and motor function that lasted for weeks after the drug was out of their systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the first time a psychedelic has been tested on patients with any neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are still in very early stages of this work, but this first study went well beyond what we expected,” said the paper’s first author, Ellen Bradley, MD, assistant professor and associate director of UCSF’s Translational Psychedelic Research Program (TrPR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people don’t realize this, but mood symptoms in Parkinson’s are linked to a faster physical decline,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And they are actually a stronger predictor of patients’ quality of life with Parkinson’s than their motor symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the TrPR Program, within UCSF’s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and the Department of Neurology, teamed up to lead this project, which was funded by an anonymous donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings appeared online earlier this month in &lt;em&gt;Neuropsychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Psilocybin’s lasting mood and motor effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by uncontrolled movements due to abnormal brain activity, affects about 1 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While medications like levodopa can relieve symptoms, there are no approved therapies to slow the progression or reverse the disease itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common early physical symptoms include tremors and foot dragging, but Bradley said anxiety and depression in patients with no history of psychiatric problems often precede the onset of motor symptoms by several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear why standard medications often don’t work well for these patients, but mood changes could be part of the neurodegenerative disease process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the safety of psilocybin for these patients, the researchers gave seven men and five women with mild to moderate Parkinson’s disease a 10 mg dose, followed two weeks later by a higher dose of 25 mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients completed psychotherapy sessions before and after the psilocybin — eight sessions in total — and were evaluated for changes in mood, cognition, and motor functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While nearly all participants experienced some adverse events while on the psilocybin, such as anxiety, nausea, and elevated blood pressure, these were not serious enough to require medical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants had meaningful improvements in their mood, cognition, and motor symptoms at both their one-week and one-month follow-up appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team evaluated the participants’ mood again three months after their psilocybin sessions and found it was still significantly improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggested a variety of explanations for the improvements. The beneficial impact of psilocybin on the patients’ mood could have led to better cognitive and motor functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, people feel better, and that, in turn, helps them socialize and become more active – both key elements of Parkinson’s treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another theory is that psilocybin could provide relief from multiple symptoms of the disease by reducing inflammation and promoting neuroplasticity – the growth and reconnection of brain cells involved in mood, cognition, and movement regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An expansion into unchartered territory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this pilot study were promising enough that the researchers are conducting a larger randomized controlled trial at UCSF, enrolling a larger and more diverse group of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study incorporates noninvasive brain stimulation, neuroimaging and other tools to understand how psilocybin impacts inflammation and neuroplasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will include a second site at Yale University, with the aim of enrolling 100 participants. This work will be funded by the same anonymous donor that paid for the safety pilot as well as by the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The vast majority of brain diseases still lack interventions that change the course of illness,” said the study’s senior author, Joshua Woolley, MD, PhD, associate professor at UCSF and director of the TrPR Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can often treat the symptoms, but we don’t alter the trajectory or prevent decline. Now, that’s beginning to change. These results raise the exciting possibility that psilocybin may help the brain repair itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Additional co-authors include Kimberly Sakai, BA, Gisele Fernandes-Osterhold, MFT, Balázs Szigeti, PhD, Connie Ludwig, PhD, Jill L.

A preventive visit generally comes at no cost to patients.

For instance, most adults who never received the HPV vaccine do not know they are eligible, so it’s critical to inform them of their options, said Verda Hicks, a gynecologic oncologist based in Kansas City, Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AQMITZYMF5CQBF3ALOJNMGETUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The vaccine offers protection against nine types of HPV, she said.

Also, prices can vary depending on where care is delivered and tests are performed. If you need a blood test, ask that your doctor send the requisition &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/routine-bloodwork-lab-work-tests-surprise-bill/" target="_blank"&gt;to a commercial, in-network lab&lt;/a&gt;.

A meta-analysis of 231 brain studies showed that chronic sleep disorders alter regions involved in emotions and memory, while short-term deprivation primarily affects attention and movement regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings could pave the way for more targeted therapies and preventive strategies for mental illnesses linked to poor sleep. Understanding these neural differences may also help develop treatments tailored to specific types of sleep disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different Brain Regions:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic sleep disorders affect the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, while short-term sleep loss impacts the thalamus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Health Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic sleep loss raises the risk of depression, anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could inform targeted therapies and future transdiagnostic studies across multiple sleep disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Forschungszentrum Juelich&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About 20% to 35% of the population suffers from chronic sleep disorders—and up to half of all people in older age. Moreover, almost every teenager or adult has experienced short-term sleep deprivation at some point. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons for not getting enough sleep, whether it be partying, a long day at work, caring for relatives, or simply whiling away time on smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109362"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain on a bed." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-brain-impact-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These regions are involved in processing emotions, memories, decisions, and sensations, for example.

In contrast, long-term pathological sleep disorders, such as insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and short-term sleep deprivation, are located in different parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Lack of sleep has negative impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerion Reimann, one of the lead authors of the study, who wrote his master’s thesis on this topic at the Jülich Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-7), says, “The symptoms of sleep deprivation are similar during the day. Anyone who has ever slept poorly or not had enough sleep will know how you often feel a bit grumpy—or unable to perform tasks well due to your attention and reaction times being significantly impaired.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated instances of sleep deprivation can have much more serious consequences. Studies show that frequent sleep deprivation has an adverse effect on brain development, reduces the removal of harmful substances from the brain, decreases emotional stability, and causes a massive decline in working memory as well as a person’s performance at school or at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chronic sleep disorders and a continual lack of sleep are also risk factors for various mental illnesses,” says Reimann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Different brain structures detected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jülich researchers analyzed data from 231 brain studies. The studies examined and compared several groups—for example, patients suffering from chronic sleep disorders with healthy individuals, or healthy, well-rested test subjects with those suffering from sleep deprivation. The results show clear neural differences between the groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with chronic sleep disorders showed changes in a region of the brain known as the “anterior cingulate cortex,” as well as in the right amygdala and in the hippocampus, one of the brain’s central hubs. These regions are involved in processing emotions, memories, decisions, and sensations, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reimann explains, “These abnormalities reflect common symptoms that occur during the day with various sleep disorders, such as exhaustion, memory problems, mood swings, and even depression. Whether the changes in the brain are the cause or a consequence of chronic sleep disorders remains to be seen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, short-term sleep deprivation was associated with changes in the right thalamus, a brain region responsible for temperature regulation, movement, and the perception of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This corresponds with the symptoms of short-term sleep deprivation,” says Reimann. “You are less attentive, restricted in your actions, and often feel the cold more easily.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Important findings for future studies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were thus able to show for the first time that there are no overlapping brain regions between the two groups,” says Reimann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is important for future studies. We can now focus on the precise structural and functional regions and networks that are representative of the respective sleep disorder,” he emphasizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individual sleep disorders have previously been considered separately from one another. Now we can also address questions about chronic sleep disorders in transdiagnostic studies—in other words, we can examine several findings at the same time,” adds Tahmasian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings might also pave the way for more targeted therapies and preventive measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many patients who suffer from insomnia—or chronic sleep disorders in general—also have an increased risk of depression, anxiety, and other mental disorders, as well as Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia,” explains Reimann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now that we know which brain regions are involved, we can investigate in more detail the effects of non-pharmacological therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, in comparison to pharmacological treatments for various sleep disorders,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fz-juelich.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gerion Reimann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fz-juelich.de/portal/DE/Home/home_node.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Forschungszentrum Juelich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Gerion Reimann – Forschungszentrum Juelich&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2025.0488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Distinct Convergent Brain Alterations in Sleep Disorders and Sleep Deprivation&lt;/a&gt;” by Gerion Reimann et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Convergent Brain Alterations in Sleep Disorders and Sleep Deprivation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep disorders have different etiologies yet share some nocturnal and daytime symptoms, suggesting common neurobiological substrates; healthy individuals undergoing experimental sleep deprivation also report analogous daytime symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, brain similarities and differences between long-term sleep disorders and short-term sleep deprivation are unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate the shared and specific neural correlates across sleep disorders and sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Sources&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, and BrainMap were searched up to January 2024 to identify relevant structural and functional neuroimaging articles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Selection&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole-brain neuroimaging articles reporting voxel-based group differences between patients with different sleep disorders and healthy control participants or between total or partial sleep-deprived and well-rested individuals were included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Extraction and Synthesis&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant coordinates of group comparisons, their contrast direction (eg, patients &amp;lt; controls), and imaging modality were extracted. For each article, 2 raters independently evaluated eligibility and extracted data. Subsequently, several meta-analyses were performed with the revised activation likelihood estimation algorithm using &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .05 cluster-level familywise error correction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transdiagnostic regional brain alterations were identified across sleep disorders and among articles reporting sleep deprivation. Their associated behavioral functions and task-based or task-free connectivity patterns were explored using 2 independent datasets (BrainMap and the enhanced Nathan Kline Institute–Rockland Sample).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 231 articles (140 unique experiments, 3380 unique participants) were retrieved. The analysis across sleep disorders (n = 95 experiments) identified the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (176 voxels, &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; score = 4.86), associated with reward, reasoning, and gustation, and the amygdala and hippocampus (130 voxels, &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; score = 4.00), associated with negative emotion processing, memory, and olfaction. Both clusters had positive functional connectivity with the default mode network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The right thalamus (153 voxels, &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; score = 5.21) emerged as a consistent regional alteration following sleep deprivation (n = 45 experiments). This cluster was associated with thermoregulation, action, and pain perception and showed positive functional connectivity with subcortical and (pre)motor regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subanalyses regarding the direction of alterations demonstrated that the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex exhibited decreased activation, connectivity, and/or volume, while the amygdala and hippocampus cluster and the thalamus cluster demonstrated increased activation,connectivity, and/or volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distinct convergent brain abnormalities were observed between long-term sleep disorders (probably reflecting shared symptoms) and short-term sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 13:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE4wTS1zdHF3RUM5cHNFcWdwWjEyTV9od2o3eUJiSnZqS0E3dDF2MHdDSklPWnV2aEpSY3JGQWwxY1U1YjJMMGVSY0N4VjM3ZUhXVUZIR1Y3RVNNTldNM25ncDdCRTlwT2VkLXJrZUp3</guid></item><item><title>专家警告说，常见的卫生间错误可能会使您面临致命癌症的风险-每日邮报 | Common bathroom mistake that can put you at risk of deadly cancer, expert warns - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Storing sun cream in the bathroom could make it less effective at guarding against deadly cancer, a doctor has warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hot steam from showers and baths can cause the protective ingredients in the cream to break down, meaning the product can fail to prevent dangerous skin damage, according to specialist Dr &lt;span&gt;Ed Robinson. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It means millions who keep their SPF in bathroom cabinets could be at risk of deadly disease, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both warm temperatures and direct sunlight,' reduce the effectiveness of the sunscreen and leave your skin unprotected,' Dr Robinson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Using degraded SPF means you are not getting the full protection advertised on the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This increases your risk of sunburn, premature ageing, and, more seriously, skin &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-8d6b1120-25c3-11f0-82e1-a544321fbb00"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In some cases, broken-down ingredients can cause skin irritation or allergic reactions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, sun creams should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Millions have been storing their sunscreen all wrong, says aesthetics doctor Ed Robinson &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Robinson, who runs his own aesthetics practice in Cheshire, urged the public to check their bottles of sunscreen for signs that the active ingredients have degraded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes a change in texture—it could be runnier, lumpier or the formula may have separated. This means it is likely to apply unevenly, leading to 'patchy' protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A foul smell or darker, yellowish colour usually means your sunscreen isn’t as able to do its job as it should be, the expert said, adding to always check the expiration date too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He advised to keep the product away from car dashboards and glove boxes, windowsills and bags that are exposed to the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the summer months are approaching, slathering on the sunscreen is the best way to avoid skin damage. Experts recommend wearing at least SPF 30 on warm days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most well-known type of harmful sun rays are UVA and UBV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UVB rays hit the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) and cause the most sunburn, while UVA rays penetrate much deeper and contribute to ageing. Both are ultraviolet, and are known to cause skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A shocking 90 per cent of skin cancer cases in the UK are a direct result of too much exposure to the sun and sunbeds, according to Cancer Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have projected a record high of 20,800 cases last year and there has been a seven per cent rise in the deadly disease in UK adults aged 25-49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, those over the age of 80 have seen a rise of 57 per cent over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Exposure to the high humidity and temperature fluctuations can degrade its effectiveness by reducing its SPF protection. A survey found 58 per cent of people forget to protect ‘sun terraces’—areas including the nose, the shoulders and the soles of the feet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite increasing awareness of the disease, 45 per cent of people in the UK don’t wear SPF every day, according to an independent YouGov survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority of people miss out parts of their body when they apply sun cream, risking sunburn which can lead to skin cancer, studies show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2015 survey found 58 per cent of people forget to protect ‘sun terraces’—areas including the nose, the shoulders and the soles of the feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also commonly forget to protect the back of the neck, the ears, and the tops of their feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other most frequently missed body parts were the the top of their head, the middle of the back, the toes/feet and the eye lids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as the Skin Cancer Foundation warned that a history of five or more sunburns doubles your risk on the deadly skin cancer melanoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

ROACH: Two years ago, my doctor (whose patient I had been for many years) decided to switch to a concierge practice. He charged $2,000 annually per patient. Neither my husband nor I chose to participate. We found a new doctor who we have been very happy with for the past two years. Now he has decided to go concierge as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2FQ6H6MRCJCH5MHRLFTLSC52VY"&gt;He is charging $2,000 annually or offering patients who do not wish to participate in a concierge practice an opportunity to pay an “administrative” fee of $500 annually to continue as one of his patients. Both my husband and I have very good insurance that covers 100% of our medical costs, and I saw my doctor three times last year. I told him that paying an additional payment of over $150 per visit is ridiculous. So, once again, we are looking for another physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HIB2EFRSONHQBPAJHWIFNSDRAY"&gt;This appears to be occurring quite often in my area. My question to you is, do you think this is right? -- P.E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HTSQF37HPZEKZG5PMHGL22HKQQ"&gt;ANSWER: In my opinion, concierge medicine can be done ethically, but I have real questions about the way your physician is moving to a concierge or “retainer” medicine practice. If a physician chooses to move to a concierge model, which by itself is not unethical, they ought to help their existing patients find care and aid with the transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LKIUZX6ZVVCKRNUJX2WGHRFWKA"&gt;I don’t agree with the $500 “administrative fee” per year, which sounds like a charge solely to remain as his patient and get no additional service. I understand the benefits of a concierge practice to a physician, and for those who can afford it, there are advantages for the patient, too. But it is my personal opinion that we physicians have an obligation to provide care.

ROACH: I first heard about a disease called “sweating sickness” while watching a television series. Do people still get sweating sickness under a different name? -- J.S.B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MC3L4UOB4NFEHKNERARMRZEL3A"&gt;ANSWER: Sweating sickness was a disease that was found in England between 1485-1581 but wasn’t seen again. The major symptoms were a rapid onset of a high fever with sweating, then death following in hours or days. The details of the described cases at the time have led medical historians to suspect that the disease was a very dangerous virus such as a hantavirus, which causes a hemorrhagic fever in Europe and Asia and a heart/lung syndrome in the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F4VOEGXGL5BDREEIXF42LZZHBE"&gt;Hantaviruses normally exist in rodents but can occasionally cross over into humans. Less than 1,000 cases of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome have been reported in the United States as of 2021, but a prominent actor’s wife recently died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OCSCWG4EQRGEDAA2HPXCDM6JHE"&gt;Other authorities suspect that sweating sickness was caused by an enterovirus (a large family of viruses that is responsible for many diseases, including polio), which is the suspected cause in a condition called acute flaccid myelitis. But we can only guess at the cause of this mysterious illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="U2437OHNYFHETEVEDH6BIAQD64"&gt;Highly virulent germs (those that kill their hosts) often die out quickly as they kill their hosts before many people get infected. However, some diseases become less virulent over time since the germs that don’t kill people have more time to quickly spread to other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LDTGPYSKOBE5JEY73AHMD3W4IM"&gt;Syphilis, for example, was a rapidly fatal disease in Europe during the 16th century, but by the 18th century, it had become a much more indolent disease. (Though, of course, it’s still dangerous and should be avoided.) The main barrier to syphilis treatment now is getting people diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6TSUFOWILREORCFE32NT3RMKSQ"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This assay is important for assigning patients to the correct clinical trials, but it will be even more important in the future as researchers develop targeted, precision treatments for PSP,” says Ivan Martinez-Valbuena, a scientific associate at the Rossy Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Centre at the UHN’s Krembil Brain Institute and U of T’s Tanz Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need diagnostic tools to be developed hand-in-hand with new treatments, so that as these treatments become available, we can identify the patients who would benefit most.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In neurodegenerative diseases, misfolded proteins – often alpha synuclein or tau proteins – accumulate in brain and nervous system cells, eventually damaging the cells and causing neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While researchers have successfully detected these misfolded proteins in cerebrospinal fluid obtained through a lumbar puncture, the technique is not always accessible and some patients are unable to undergo the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, patients are typically diagnosed based on their symptoms and clinical presentation, so some patients may be misdiagnosed – particularly for rarer neurodegenerative diseases such as PSP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could also have a negative impact on research since patients with PSP may be misdiagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and be included in a trial that targets the wrong protein, influencing the results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research that led to the PSP breakthrough has roots in an earlier study. In previous research, Martinez-Valbuena and his colleagues developed a test that could detect misfolded alpha synuclein protein in the skin in patients with Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have since validated that assay and hope it can be used in clinical trials, although the test is not yet available for clinical diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team wanted to extend that test for use in PSP. Using the same technology as the alpha synuclein assay, the team developed a test that could detect a sequence of misfolded tau specific to PSP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Following a meticulous and innovative strategy, Ivan reported for the first time in the literature that disease-associated tau protein can be detected in the skin in living patients with high accuracy,” says Gabor Kovacs, Martinez-Valbuena’s supervisor, a neuropathologist at UHN and a principal investigator at the Tanz Centre who is also a professor of laboratory medicine and pathobiology in U of T’s Temerty Faculty of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working collaboratively with colleagues in the Rossy PSP Centre, Martinez-Valbuena, Kovacs and a clinical team led by Anthony Lang – who is director of the Rossy Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Centre, the Lily Safra Chair in Movement Disorders at UHN and the Jack Clark Chair for Parkinson’s Disease Research at U of T’s Temerty Faculty of Medicine – were able to access patient samples and validate the new test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers examined skin biopsies of patients with PSP as well as people with multiple system atrophy, corticobasal degeneration, Parkinson’s disease and healthy controls, they found misfolded tau in most patients with PSP, but much less frequently in other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the misfolded tau protein was not detected in patients with Parkinson’s disease or the healthy controls. Overall, the researchers found that the assay had 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am so delighted to see this exciting development of a new biomarker for this rare neurodegenerative disease, made possible by the close collaboration of world-leading scientists in Toronto,” says Graham Collingridge, senior investigator at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Sinai Health and director of the Tanz Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martinez-Valbuena says the test could be incorporated into a panel of blood- and skin-based tests, along with clinical information, to help clinicians make more precise diagnoses and recommend more appropriate clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It will be important to pair this skin-based assay together with a patient’s clinical symptoms, and this will give us a much better picture of the patient’s diagnosis,” says Martinez-Valbuena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once we have precision treatments targeting these misfolded proteins, we will have a better idea of the treatment each patient should receive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now validating the assay in more patients through a clinical trial at five PSP centres in North America and Europe. The Toronto team will continue to study the assay to ensure it is practical and convenient for use outside of major research centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this PSP and neurology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/news/authors-reporters/eileen-hoftyzer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eileen Hoftyzer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Toronto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Eileen Hoftyzer – University of Toronto&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2824066" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Four-Repeat Tau Seeding in the Skin of Patients With Progressive Supranuclear Palsy&lt;/a&gt;” by Ivan Martinez-Valbuena et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four-Repeat Tau Seeding in the Skin of Patients With Progressive Supranuclear Palsy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emergence of α-synuclein seeding amplification assays (SAA) has provided a new tool to support a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technology enables the detection of aggregated forms of α-synuclein (the neuropathologic hallmark of these diseases) in brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and in peripheral tissues, such as skin.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 12:59:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE9Fb3pJUUtUTUtRM2REa0QxWG9QTjZkVkt4QllHNDNJalJkeDRCOGxRbHVrYnV4dEFsVkZvalJ4NWkxYXp1UU5HMEVzbmVMVndGS25MT3p3U2xmcVhmMUJOdl8tMVZhUjRuT0E0</guid></item></channel></rss>
