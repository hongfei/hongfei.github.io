        &lt;p&gt;A painful and serious gut problem is increasingly afflicting younger Americans, and no one’s sure why. Recent research shows that cases of severe diverticulitis among people under the age of 50 have substantially risen over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, and others examined data from millions of Americans hospitalized by diverticulitis. They found that the proportion of severe, or complicated, diverticulitis cases in younger Americans noticeably increased between 2005 and 2020. The reasons for this surge are unclear, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Additional research is needed to determine the cause of these trends and identify public health policies aimed at potentially preventing the increasing burden of diverticulitis among younger populations,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/dcrjournal/abstract/2025/05000/national_trends_in_hospital_admissions,.13.aspx"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Diseases of the Colon &amp;amp; Rectum&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A problematic pouch&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The outer wall of our large intestine can develop a pocket- or pouch-like structure alongside it, formally known as a diverticulum (diverticula for plural). These pouches are harmless on their own, and most people will never be bothered by them. But the pouches can become inflamed and/or infected: a condition we call &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10352-diverticulitis"&gt;diverticulitis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Most cases of diverticulitis are uncomplicated, meaning the inflammation is localized. Though painful, this form can usually be managed with rest, a change in diet, and occasionally antibiotics. Complicated cases are caused by more widespread inflammation, which can then lead to severe, potentially life-threatening issues like gastrointestinal bleeding, abscesses, and even a ruptured colon. It’s these cases that often require hospitalization and sometimes radical interventions like the surgical removal of some or all of a person’s colon (a colectomy).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cases of diverticulitis, both mild and severe, are much more common in people over 50. But this latest research suggests that things are changing, and not for the better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A worrying trend with no clear answer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, the country’s largest publicly available database of hospital visits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between 2005 and 2020, they found, at least five million Americans were hospitalized for their diverticulitis. About 16% of these cases were early-onset, occurring in people under 50. Over time, the researchers found, more of these early-onset cases led to severe illness. During the study period, the percentage of severe diverticulitis among early-onset cases significantly increased, from 18.5% to 28.2%.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;On the positive side, people with early-onset diverticulitis were less likely to die from their condition than older cases and had shorter hospital stays on average. The proportion of early-onset cases treated with colectomy also declined over time (from 35% to 20%), suggesting that doctors have gotten better at managing the condition with less intrusive measures. But younger people were also more likely to require surgery or other invasive treatments for their condition than older patients.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, the researchers say, there’s no easy explanation for why these cases are becoming more common in younger Americans. It is possible that some of the same risk factors linked to increased early-onset cases of colorectal cancers, such as obesity, may also be driving an increase in diverticulitis. Other lifestyle factors, such as a diet high in fiber, are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6731157/"&gt;thought&lt;/a&gt; to lower people’s risk of diverticulitis, and most Americans simply aren’t getting &lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/most-americans-are-not-getting-enough-fiber-in-our-diets/"&gt;enough fiber&lt;/a&gt; in general. Younger people also seem to be &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0316051"&gt;exercising less&lt;/a&gt; than earlier generations, and physical activity is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrgastro.2009.94"&gt;another protective factor&lt;/a&gt; against diverticulitis.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Without more study, though, we can’t know for sure just how much these and other factors could be playing a role in early-onset diverticulitis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Little is known about why we’re seeing this increase in younger patients,” said lead author Shineui Kim, a researcher at UCLA Health, in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-analysis-alarming-severe-diverticulitis-younger.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “We urgently need additional research to determine what’s driving these trends, whether it’s dietary factors, lifestyle changes, obesity rates or other environmental influences.”&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

In contrast, men needed to reach 530 minutes, or nearly nine hours, a week to see the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study builds on previous work that suggests women benefit more than men from the same amount of exercise, but that women are generally less physically active and less likely to meet recommended exercise targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Under &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/physical-activity-guidelines-for-adults-aged-19-to-64/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;NHS guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, men and women aged 16 to 64 should take at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, each week, combined with muscle-strengthening activities at least twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But the latest work stresses the need for tailored advice for men and women, and highlights the substantial health benefits women can achieve with only moderate amounts of exercise. Globally, one in three women die of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Compared with male individuals, females derive equivalent health benefits with only half the exercise time,” the authors write in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-025-00732-z" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nature Cardiovascular Research&lt;/a&gt;. “The findings might have potential to encourage females to engage in physical activity,” they add.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Jiajin Chen at Xiamen University in China and his colleagues analysed data from activity trackers worn by middle-aged volunteers enrolled in the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/nov/30/uk-biobank-and-the-masses-of-medical-data-that-became-key-to-genetic-research" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;UK Biobank project&lt;/a&gt;. They first looked at 80,243 participants who did not have coronary heart disease. In this group, women who met the 150-minute weekly exercise target had a 22% lower risk of developing heart disease over eight years of follow-up, compared with those who did not. For men, the risk was 17% lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Further analysis showed that women could reduce their heart disease risk by 30% through exercising for 250 minutes a week, a benefit men only achieved on reaching 530 minutes of physical activity each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The most striking result emerged from data on more than 5,000 men and women who already had coronary heart disease. Here, the researchers found that the risk of dying during the follow-up period was three times lower for women who met the weekly exercise target than for similarly active men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="e5608e87-b2f8-4e1c-ada5-c1d13b3f617c" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":9,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"New AI tool can predict a person’s risk of more than 1,000 diseases, say experts","elementId":"e5608e87-b2f8-4e1c-ada5-c1d13b3f617c","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/sep/17/new-ai-tool-can-predict-a-persons-risk-of-more-than-1000-diseases-say-experts"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Yan Wang, a senior author on the paper, said the work showed both sexes could gain “substantial cardiovascular benefits” from physical activity and recommended everyone, regardless of their sex, to take regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But he added that, globally, more women than men were not meeting physical activity targets. “We particularly hope that our findings could encourage physically inactive females to become more active, thereby reducing their cardiovascular risk,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is unclear why exercise may benefit women more than men, but scientists point to differences in sex hormones, muscle fibres and the ability to break down sugar to produce energy as potential factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-025-00734-x" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;accompanying article&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Emily Lau, a women’s cardiovascular health specialist at Massachusetts General hospital, writes: “This study provides further evidence that one size really does not fit all and challenges us to move from conversation to action.

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleeping with the lights on is linked to a 42% higher risk of heart attack compared to sleeping in darkness, based on a study tracking nearly 90,000 adults over 9 years.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The brightest bedrooms also showed higher risks for heart failure, coronary artery disease, irregular heartbeat, and stroke.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The connection held even after accounting for diet, exercise, smoking, and genetics, suggesting light at night is a factor worth managing for heart health.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Simple fixes like blackout curtains, turning off devices, and keeping bedrooms dark may help protect your heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s the glow from your alarm clock, the TV you fall asleep to, or the hallway light you leave on throughout the night. Whatever the source, sleeping with ambient light might be doing more than disrupting your sleep—it could be affecting your heart. A study of 89,000 people found those with the brightest bedrooms had a 42% higher rate of heart attacks over nearly 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The connection held true regardless of how much people exercised, what they ate, whether they smoked, or how their genes predisposed them to heart disease. Light exposure at night remained linked to cardiovascular health even after accounting for familiar risk factors like poor diet and lack of physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also found elevated risks for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;, coronary artery disease, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/irregular-heartbeat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;irregular heartbeat&lt;/a&gt;, and stroke. Researchers tracked 88,905 people in the United Kingdom who wore light-tracking devices on their wrists for one week, then followed their health records for the next 9.5 years. The average age was 62, and about 57% were women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How Researchers Measured Personal Light Exposure Around the Clock&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants wore small sensors on their wrists that recorded light levels around the clock for seven days, collecting approximately 13 million hours of light data total. Rather than relying on satellite data measuring outdoor lighting, this approach captured personal exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers identified daytime light exposure (7:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.) and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/study-finds-smartphone-screen-insomnia-sleeping/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nighttime light exposure&lt;/a&gt; (12:30 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.), then grouped participants by their light levels. Those with the darkest nights (the bottom half) served as the comparison group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People in moderately bright rooms had a 20% higher risk of heart attack. Those in brighter rooms faced a 27% higher risk. The brightest rooms showed a 47% increase. After accounting for age, sex, ethnicity, season, socioeconomic status, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and diet quality, the risk for the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/light-pollution-alzheimers-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brightest rooms&lt;/a&gt; remained at 42%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-tiny-font-size"&gt;Bright bedrooms impact heart health as well as sleep quality. (Credit: Jozeph Forakis via SWNS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why Light at Night Disrupts Your Heart Health&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The human body runs on circadian rhythms (internal clocks that regulate everything from blood pressure to heart rate to the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/stress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;release of stress hormones&lt;/a&gt;). Light is the primary signal that keeps these rhythms synchronized with the 24-hour day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When light hits the eyes at night, it disrupts these rhythms. Blood pressure normally dips during sleep, but exposure to light can keep it elevated. Hormones that should peak in the morning may be released at the wrong times. The balance between the sympathetic nervous system (which activates “fight or flight” responses) and the parasympathetic system (which promotes “rest and digest”) gets thrown off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the short term, circadian disruption raises heart rate, increases inflammation, and promotes blood clotting. Over years, these changes can contribute to atherosclerosis (the hardening of the arteries that sets the stage for heart attacks). When arterial plaques rupture or blood clots form in narrowed vessels, heart muscle tissue gets starved of oxygen, causing a &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research on shift workers, who regularly experience bright light during nighttime hours, has documented higher rates of heart disease for decades. This new study extends those findings to the general population, showing that even ambient light in bedrooms or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/sleep-blue-light-glasses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;from devices&lt;/a&gt; can carry risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2840489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, also found that circadian disruption may increase the risk of irregular heartbeats. When the body’s master clock in the brain sends conflicting signals to the heart’s own cellular clocks, the result can be irregular heartbeats that increase stroke risk and reduce the heart’s pumping efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who Is Most Affected? Women and Younger Adults at Higher Risk&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Women appeared more vulnerable to the heart-damaging effects of nighttime light than men, particularly for coronary artery disease and heart failure. Previous research has found that women may be more sensitive to bright light than men, with their circadian systems responding more strongly to the same light levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Younger adults in the study also showed larger increases in risk for heart failure and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/yoga-afib-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt; compared to older participants. This pattern could reflect that older adults generally have less sensitive circadian systems, meaning their bodies may not respond as strongly to nighttime light exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Genetic susceptibility to heart disease didn’t change the relationship between light and cardiovascular risk. People with higher genetic risk scores still showed the same association between bright nights and increased disease as those with lower genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Surprising Benefits of Daytime Light Exposure&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At first glance, brighter daytime light appeared protective. People exposed to the brightest daytime light had a 13% lower risk of coronary artery disease, a 28% lower risk of heart failure, and a 27% lower risk of stroke compared to those with the darkest days. However, these protective effects disappeared after adjusting for lifestyle factors, particularly physical activity. People who &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;spend time outdoors&lt;/a&gt; in bright daylight are also more likely to be physically active, and exercise is a well-established protective factor for heart health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers looked at the effect of bright days without factoring in exercise, the protective effect reappeared for heart failure and stroke, suggesting that daytime light exposure and physical activity may work together to support cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What This Means for Protecting Your Heart Health&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was limited by a number of factors warranting acknowledgment. Light exposure was measured for only one week, though participants’ light patterns remained fairly consistent over time. The study couldn’t determine specific light sources (&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/outdoor-lights-diabetes-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;streetlights&lt;/a&gt;, bedroom lamps, televisions, or smartphones). The UK Biobank participants are predominantly White (97%), better educated, higher income, and healthier than the general population. The study is also observational, meaning it shows associations but can’t prove direct causation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death worldwide. This study points to avoiding light at night as a new prevention tool. Unlike genetic risk factors, light exposure is modifiable through blackout curtains, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/phone-panic-battery-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;turning off devices&lt;/a&gt;, using dim red lights for necessary nighttime activities, and keeping bedrooms dark.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/night-shift-sleep-disorders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shift workers&lt;/a&gt; or those with unavoidable light exposure, managing other cardiovascular risk factors through diet, exercise, and regular health screenings becomes especially important. Darkness matters for heart health. This research shows that sleeping in darkness appears important beyond just sleep duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from 88,905 UK Biobank participants who wore light-tracking sensors on their wrists for one week between 2013 and 2016. The sensors recorded light exposure continuously, capturing approximately 13 million hours of data. Participants were then followed through health records until November 2022, a span of about 9.5 years. The researchers used factor analysis to identify two distinct time windows: daytime light exposure (7:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.) and nighttime light exposure (12:30 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.). They divided participants into four groups based on their light exposure percentiles: 0-50th (darkest), 51st-70th, 71st-90th, and 91st-100th (brightest). Cardiovascular disease diagnoses came from hospital admission records, primary care records, self-reports, and death registers. The conditions tracked included coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction (heart attack), heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Statistical models used Cox proportional hazards analysis adjusted at three levels for various confounding factors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants exposed to the brightest nighttime light (91st-100th percentiles) had significantly higher risks for all five cardiovascular outcomes compared to those in the darkest environments (0-50th percentiles). The adjusted hazard ratios in the most adjusted model were 1.23 for coronary artery disease, 1.42 for myocardial infarction, 1.45 for heart failure, 1.28 for atrial fibrillation, and 1.28 for stroke. Dose-response relationships were observed, meaning higher light exposure correlated with higher disease risk across the percentile groups. The associations remained statistically significant after adjusting for established cardiovascular risk factors including physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, sleep duration, pre-existing diabetes, hypertension, body mass index, cholesterol levels, and genetic susceptibility. Women showed larger-magnitude associations between nighttime light and heart failure and coronary artery disease compared to men. Younger participants in the cohort showed stronger associations between nighttime light and heart failure and atrial fibrillation compared to older participants. Brighter daytime light showed some protective associations with cardiovascular outcomes in initial models, but these effects were not statistically significant after adjusting for lifestyle factors, particularly physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Light exposure was measured for only one week per participant, which may not fully capture long-term patterns, although previous research indicates individual light patterns remain relatively stable over time. The study could not determine the sources of nighttime light exposure, so researchers couldn’t distinguish between different types of light (streetlights, electronic devices, indoor lighting). The UK Biobank cohort is predominantly White (97%), better educated, higher income, and healthier than the general UK population, which may limit how well the findings apply to more diverse groups. Some covariates such as physical activity and pre-existing health conditions may lie on the causal pathway between light exposure and cardiovascular disease, making it difficult to determine whether adjusting for them is appropriate. The study is observational, meaning it can show associations but cannot prove that nighttime light directly causes cardiovascular disease. Information about some variables was collected before light tracking and may have changed during the follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;

In &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://slate.com/tag/direct-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Direct Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, she spotlights themes from her inbox that help explain the modern workplace and how we could be navigating it better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2glh86005r3b78odevcpvm@published"&gt;Workplace “wellness” initiatives—like free yoga classes, mindfulness tips, step challenges, diet advice, and other pushes for well-being now common at work—are supposed to be a win–win situation: Employees get healthier and happier while employers reap the benefits of lower health care costs. But in practice, these programs frequently miss the mark, and many employees perceive them as intrusive and out of touch.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="30" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2gdlvk000o3b787pbtluea@published"&gt;Here’s how &lt;a href="https://www.askamanager.org/2021/09/companies-lip-service-about-self-care-isnt-what-employees-need.html#comment-3565275" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;one person&lt;/a&gt; who wrote to me responded when their company announced that the topics for their monthly wellness trainings would include fitness, nutrition, meditation, body image, and “resilience”:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My boss told my team that he wants us all to attend unless we have an urgent deadline and … why? None of these topics are my company’s business! They aren’t my doctor or my therapist. I’m here to work, not to get lectured by my employer about how healthy kale is, and I really don’t want to spend any time discussing my body image with colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2gexc5001u3b78z2tw5bnd@published"&gt;This reaction speaks for a lot of employees. When workplace wellness programs fail to account for the boundaries that many people prefer to have with their employers, they end up creating discomfort and resentment instead of fostering the well-being they purport to promote.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="32" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2gf01f00253b78q5eoe2gf@published"&gt;Probably nowhere is this more visible than when employers try to give out &lt;a href="https://www.askamanager.org/2019/06/my-employer-is-asking-invasive-questions-as-part-of-a-wellness-benefit.html#comment-2524011"&gt;diet advice&lt;/a&gt;—a topic that can be loaded under the best of circumstances and where advice can’t be one-size-fits all:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I had health insurance through my husband’s employer, we both had to do wellness questionnaires. Since I have chronic health problems, I was required to talk to a “health coach” on the phone. Her big solution for me was to make goulash so I’d have a healthy lunch available and wouldn’t have to cook during my lunch break (I work from home). Yeah, like goulash is gonna cure my lupus. To top it all off, the company’s insurance was the worst I’ve ever had. The plan had a huge deductible/huge out-of-pocket max, and they didn’t pay &lt;em&gt;any &lt;/em&gt;expenses until the deductible had been met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="8" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2gfjtp002q3b78xox1tlh9@published"&gt;A similarly irritated worker sent me &lt;a href="https://www.askamanager.org/2019/12/fitness-emails-accidentally-sent-personal-email.html"&gt;this account&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My company includes an on-site fitness center, and all the employees receive periodic emails from the fitness staff. There’s one kind of message they frequently send that bothers me a lot—talking about food and exercise in a really negative, kind of accusatory way that tends to moralize “good” vs. “bad” choices. For example, before Thanksgiving we all got an email listing exactly how many calories a serving of X food would contain, and exactly how much exercise of Y variety we would need to do to “burn it off.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2gh9vf003c3b78djv5z8f4@published"&gt;Not only do these messages annoy people who don’t come to work to be scolded about food, they can be outright harmful to anyone with a history of disordered eating. Yet workplaces continue to &lt;a href="https://www.askamanager.org/2016/08/workplace-weight-loss-programs-and-eating-disorders-giving-a-reference-for-a-coworker-who-drinks-heavily-and-more.html"&gt;assume&lt;/a&gt; that all employees want to lose weight, and all want support from their employers in doing it:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My workplace just decided to do a casual, team-wide weight loss competition. Participation is voluntary and each participant puts money in the pot initially, plus a dollar for every pound lost. The winner wins the pot at the end. This hit me hard because I have an eating disorder, and I avoid those teammates who like to talk about their eating and diet habits all the time. But now everybody around me is talking about it all the time, and I thank god nobody has asked me if I am participating yet (everybody is doing it, not just overweight people). This is seriously triggering and upsetting for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other people may be trying to establish a healthier relationship with dieting, or might need to maintain their weight or gain weight, or simply might not consider their diet or their weight to be any of their employer’s business and don’t want to engage with their co-workers about it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really wish employers would think more about the various wellness messaging they put out and how likely it is to backfire or grate on people’s nerves. The “Tips for good sleep!” always seem to come out the day after one of my kids was up all night with an ear infection. There’s a poster in our building with wellness tips that includes “Do relaxing activities for 2-3 hours before bed,” and I’m like, “We’re a family with two full-time working parents and two young kids. When exactly am I supposed to do the dishes or clean the house or clear out my inbox or exercise?” That overly chipper tone that makes it sound like you’re just a few easy life hacks away from living your best life comes across as so clueless about the realities of people’s lives. And it’s worse for people who have disabilities or medical conditions or major life stresses that make adhering to some of these wellness tips even more impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My officially logged task/ticket list just hit 200 things to do because my team of 2.25 people is understaffed by at least 2 full-time people. And the continual step-count challenges, weight loss tips, and “combat burnout by taking time to practice mindfulness” emails do nothing but raise my blood pressure and irritation levels when what we need is management to stop spending money on nutritionist consulting services and instead hire more employees. It is starting to feel like they’re pushing the responsibility for failure onto their burnt-out employees because in their eyes obviously we wouldn’t be having problems with the workload if we did all the things the emails told us to do. I’d much rather they address the chronic understaffing problems than anything else right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But those things cost money, and workshops about the importance of nutrition and meditation—and apparently advisers who recommend “goulash”—are a whole lot &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;cheaper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Dr. Kawashima and Nintendo were right: brain-training games can actually have a significant positive effect and reduce the effects of aging on our brain. A &lt;a href="https://games.jmir.org/2025/1/e75161"&gt;new scientific study&lt;/a&gt; has found that as much as a decade of aging may be offset by our efforts playing them, which is good news if you spent a very long time playing Brain Training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key finding was that doing rigorous mental exercises for 30 minutes a day boosts the chemical messenger acetylcholine, which not only carries messages across the brain but improves learning, memory and attention functions. Acetylcholine levels typically deplete with age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;a class="button video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5QusYYL9fs" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The study monitored 95 people over the age of 65 years for 10 weeks and found a 2.3 percent rise in acetylcholine after doing brain training exercises for 30 minutes a day. As &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/22/nx-s1-5581409/mental-exercise-reverse-brain-change-aging-acetylcholine?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;amp;utm_source=bsky.app"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt; noted in an article about the report, 2.3 percent doesn't sound enormous, but when you consider there's usually a decrease of 2.5 percent &lt;em&gt;per decade&lt;/em&gt; due to aging, it reframes the discovery. Brain-training games may offset as much as a decade of degradation caused by aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="injection_placeholder" data-position="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an important distinction to make, though. In order to achieve the desired result, you need to play games that are specifically designed to exercise these parts of your brain, such as Nintendo's Brain Training once was. &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush"&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/a&gt; and solitaire won't do it; they were what half of the participants played during the test and their acetylcholine levels didn't change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Ryuta Kawashima was the neuroscientist Nintendo's games were developed in collaboration with, and brain age (as the game was titled in Japan) and dementia prevention are specific areas of expertise of his. In other words: this is exactly the sort of thing he was trying to achieve with his Nintendo games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brain Training games first appeared here in 2006. They were made up of many mind-stretching games based around maths, memory recall, and many other things, and you'd play them every day and the game would give a score based on your performance. &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-brainage-ds"&gt;We gave the original Brain Training 9/10 in our review&lt;/a&gt;, and the series would go on to have numerous sequels and even a Switch version released in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

            If you’re experiencing joint pain in the knees, the solution might be to walk it off.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000g3b6nzh6j6eeg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aerobic exercise can reduce pain, improve movement and enhance quality of life for patients with knee osteoarthritis, according to a study published October 15 in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj-2025-085242" target="_blank"&gt;The BMJ&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Around &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;1 in 5 adults&lt;/a&gt;, or 54 million people, are affected by some type of arthritis in the United States. The most common form is osteoarthritis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000i3b6nb21hx7ai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Osteoarthritis is wear and tear of cartilage, or the covering at the end of bones, which leads to pain, stiffness and decreased joint function,” said Dr. Antonia F. Chen, chair and professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, via email. She was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000j3b6n8168wqph@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is incredibly common — sources have estimated that &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/5599-osteoarthritis" target="_blank"&gt;80% of adults&lt;/a&gt; greater than 55 years old have some arthritis, and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/osteoarthritis" target="_blank"&gt;500 million people&lt;/a&gt; are affected by osteoarthritis worldwide.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000k3b6nl6vzdugs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/osteoarthritis#:~:text=Key%20facts,benefit%20from%20rehabilitation%20(3)." target="_blank"&gt;causes of osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt; include injury, preexisting joint disease, specific metabolic diseases such as obesity or type 2 diabetes, and genetics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000l3b6nkuvlmu1i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Osteoarthritis is a leading cause of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3766936/" target="_blank"&gt;chronic disability&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the most commonly affected joints is the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21750-osteoarthritis-knee" target="_blank"&gt;knee&lt;/a&gt;. While knee osteoarthritis isn’t reversible, there are ways to reduce pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000m3b6nvk14owjx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Aerobic exercise consistently showed the greatest benefits across almost all outcomes,’ said Dr. Lei Yan, the study’s first author, in an email. “It reduced pain, improved movement and gait performance, and enhanced overall quality of life more effectively than any other exercise type.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000n3b6n7s8rsc41@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/7050-aerobic-exercise" target="_blank"&gt;Aerobic exercises&lt;/a&gt; are rhythmic and repetitive movements, such as walking, jogging, cycling and swimming.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000o3b6n4h04a012@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aerobic exercises “help nourish the joints, they strengthen supporting muscles, and they reduce pain,” said CNN fitness contributor Dana Santas, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000p3b6nm7z1sgx5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients with knee osteoarthritis should be doing “low to moderate-impact aerobic activity. This is not high-impact aerobic activity, and people with knee osteoarthritis should definitely avoid running or plyometrics, like jump training,” Santas said  .
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000q3b6nl3lbhqlt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You don’t have to aim immediately for &lt;a href="http://cnn.com/2025/07/23/health/daily-steps-how-many-wellness"&gt;10,000 steps&lt;/a&gt; a day or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/25/health/world-health-organization-physical-activity-guidelines-wellness/index.html"&gt;150 minutes&lt;/a&gt; of exercise a week, which are both common recommendations for exercise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000r3b6n28ekwkla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For patients just starting to exercise, walking or cycling for five to 10 minutes a day can help you get started in receiving those benefits and restrengthening the muscles around your joints, according to Santas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000s3b6nyolg3ia6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But before starting any movement, you should properly warm up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000t3b6nbulrkw3f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You can start by “mobilizing of your ankles and your hips” with stretches, such as ankle circles or simple &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/health/hip-exercises-knee-pain-relief-wellness"&gt;hip mobility&lt;/a&gt; stretches, Santas said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000u3b6n8k52k20b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Being conscious of your body during these exercises and pacing yourself is also key.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000v3b6nb59leac9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And it’s important for people &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/health-fitness/best-knee-brace?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=mainsite&amp;amp;utm_id=features"&gt;managing knee osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt; to avoid doing deep squats and twisting their hips because if hips are tight, then the movement is “going to go to the joint above or below, which is the knee,” Santas said.

            No matter what aerobic exercise you choose to do, you should “ensure that your knees, which are a hinge joint, aren’t being asked to do something that they’re not designed to do, because that’s only going to cause more issues,” she added.

            This movement can be modified by shifting your weight to one leg and coming “onto the toes of the opposite leg, so that you’re not putting weight” on the nonworking leg, according to Santas.

            While strength training and aerobic exercise can improve mobility, “the benefits depend on consistency — patients don’t need to train intensely, but they do need to keep moving regularly,” said Yan, a doctoral student at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

            The study’s findings were based on a systematic review and network meta-analysis that looked at 217 randomized controlled trials with over 15,000 participants from around the world. Researchers analyzed the impact of seven exercises and followed up with participants after four, 12 and 24 weeks.

The research, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2025.116613" target="_blank"&gt;Psychiatry Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, also found that while parent-reported symptoms of ADHD remained stable in boys, there was a small but statistically significant increase in symptoms among girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by differences in social communication and interaction, along with restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD, is another neurodevelopmental condition marked by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that can interfere with functioning or development. Over the past two decades, the number of clinical diagnoses for both conditions has increased substantially in many Western countries, particularly among teenagers and young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trend has raised questions about whether the underlying traits associated with these conditions are becoming more common in the general population. Researchers sought to investigate this possibility by looking beyond clinical diagnoses to the level of symptoms reported by parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The frequency of clinical diagnoses of ASD and ADHD has increased substantially over the past decades across the world,” said study author Olof Arvidsson, a PhD student at the &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/gnc" target="_blank"&gt;Gillberg Neuropsychiatry Centre&lt;/a&gt; at Gothenburg University and resident physician in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The largest prevalence increase has been among teenagers and young adults. Therefore, we wanted to investigate if symptoms of ASD and ADHD in the population had increased over time in 18-year-olds. In this study we used data from a twin study in Sweden in which parents reported on symptoms of ASD and ADHD when their children turned 18 and investigated whether symptoms had increased between year 2011 to 2019.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct their analysis, the researchers utilized data from a large, ongoing project called the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden. This study follows twins born in Sweden to learn more about mental and physical health. For this specific investigation, researchers focused on information collected from the parents of nearly 10,000 twins born between 1993 and 2001. When the twins reached their 18th birthday, their parents were asked to complete a web-based questionnaire about their children’s behaviors and traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents answered a set of 12 questions designed to measure symptoms related to autism. These items correspond to the diagnostic criteria for ASD. For ADHD, parents completed a 17-item checklist covering problems associated with inattention and executive function, which are core components of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this data, the researchers employed statistical methods to analyze whether the average symptom scores changed across the nine different birth years, from 1993 to 2001. They also looked at the percentage of individuals who scored in the highest percentiles, representing those with the most significant number of traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed no increase in the average level of parent-reported autism symptoms among 18-year-olds across the nine-year span. This stability was observed for both boys and girls. Similarly, when the researchers examined the proportion of individuals with the highest symptom scores, defined as those in the top five percent, they found no statistically significant change over time. This suggests that the prevalence of autism-related traits in the young adult population remained constant during this period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results for ADHD presented a more nuanced picture. Among boys, the data indicated that parent-reported ADHD symptoms were stable. There was no significant change in either the average symptom scores or in the percentage of boys scoring in the top 10 percent. For girls, however, the study identified a small but statistically detectable increase in ADHD symptoms over the nine birth years. This trend was apparent in both the average symptom scores and in the proportion of girls who scored in the top 10 percent for ADHD traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being statistically significant, the researchers note that the magnitude of this increase in girls was small. The year of birth explained only a very small fraction of the variation in ADHD symptom scores. The results suggest that while there may be a slight upward trend in certain ADHD symptoms among adolescent girls, it is not nearly large enough to account for the substantial increase in clinical ADHD diagnoses reported in this group. The study provides evidence that the steep rise in both autism and ADHD diagnoses is likely influenced by factors other than a simple increase in the symptoms themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Across the nine birth years examined, there was no sign of increasing symptoms of ASD in the population, despite rising diagnoses,” Arvidsson told PsyPost. “For ADHD, there was no increase among boys. However, in 18-year-old girls we saw a very small but statistically significant increase in ADHD symptoms. The increase in absolute numbers was small in relation to the increase in clinical diagnoses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers propose several alternative explanations for the growing number of diagnoses. Increased public and professional awareness may lead more people to seek assessments. Diagnostic criteria for both conditions have also widened over the years, potentially including individuals who would not have met the threshold in the past. Another factor may be a change in perception, where certain behaviors are now seen as more impairing than they were previously. This aligns with other research indicating that parents today tend to report higher levels of dysfunction associated with the same number of symptoms compared to a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in societal demands, particularly in educational settings that place a greater emphasis on executive functioning and complex social skills, could also contribute. In some cases, a formal diagnosis may be a prerequisite for accessing academic support and resources, creating an incentive for assessment. For the slight increase in ADHD symptoms among girls, the authors suggest it could reflect better recognition of how ADHD presents in females, or perhaps an overlap with symptoms of anxiety and depression, which have also been on the rise in this demographic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The takeaway is that the increases in clinical diagnoses of both ASD and ADHD need to be explained by other factors than increasing symptoms in the population, such as increased awareness and increased perceived impairment related to ASD and ADHD symptoms,” Arvidsson said. “Taken together we also hope to curb any worries about a true increase in ASD or ADHD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has some limitations. The response rate for the parental questionnaires was about 41 percent. While the researchers checked for potential biases and found that their main conclusions about the trends over time were likely unaffected, a higher participation rate would strengthen the findings. Additionally, the questionnaire for ADHD primarily measured symptoms of inattention and did not include items on hyperactivity. The results, therefore, mainly speak to the inattentive aspects of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore these trends with different measures and in different populations. The researchers also plan to investigate trends in clinical diagnoses more closely to better understand resource allocation for healthcare systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to better understand trends of clinical diagnoses, such as trends of incidence of diagnoses in different groups,” Arvidsson said. “With increasing clinical diagnoses of ASD and ADHD and the resulting impact on the healthcare system as well as on the affected patients, it is important to characterize these trends in order to motivate an increased allocation of resources.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2025.116613" target="_blank"&gt;ASD and ADHD symptoms in 18-year-olds – A population-based study of twins born 1993 to 2001&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Olof Arvidsson, Isabell Brikell, Henrik Larsson, Paul Lichtenstein, Ralf Kuja-Halkola, Mats Johnson, Christopher Gillberg, and Sebastian Lundström.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 12:06:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNWklQNk0wZ1pBY3lpdElDTF9tdkxLVVJuZlk4Sm81bWJFUkstM01pakRQdVc0QjFYRWwyTUlCME1nWkdLc0NfcUc2dlFxXzJGRDRkWU91aU9rWmQxb2lrX29RdGNYd1BIX3pSOERoQWk4YXhOSUFXZHppNEdwZEMtaDJOYUpvakJGTzZEUDZEMnhoYi10UkQyWDdmbVo</guid></item><item><title>医生对心力衰竭的可怕警告： “如果你晚上不刷牙，你可能会……” -印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/physicians-dire-warning-for-heart-failure-if-you-skip-brushing-your-teeth-at-night-you-might-be-/articleshow/124818504.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brushing your teeth before bed might feel like a small task, but it plays a major role in maintaining both your oral and overall health. For many people, the nighttime brushing routine often gets skipped due to tiredness, forgetfulness, or a busy lifestyle. However, experts warn that missing this step regularly can lead to more serious consequences than just cavities or bad breath. Recent medical research has found strong evidence linking poor oral hygiene, particularly skipping the nighttime brushing habit, with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Doctors and researchers suggest that what happens inside your mouth can directly impact your heart health over time, making it important to maintain consistent oral care habits every day. Take a look&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why brushing before bed is important&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brushing before bed helps remove food particles, plaque, and bacteria that accumulate throughout the day. When these are not cleaned, bacteria continue to grow inside the mouth overnight. During sleep, the body produces less saliva, which means harmful bacteria are not washed away as effectively as they are during the day. This bacterial buildup not only damages teeth and gums but also allows bacteria to enter the bloodstream through the gums, potentially leading to inflammation in other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Heart Failure Warning: 4 Symptoms You Might Be Overlooking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dentists recommend brushing at least twice daily using fluoride toothpaste, with one brushing session ideally right before going to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This practice helps prevent plaque formation, tooth decay, and gum infections such as gingivitis and periodontitis, all of which can contribute to broader health complications if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Skipping nighttime brushing raises &lt;keyword id="117152" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="heart-disease-risk" source="Orion"&gt;heart disease risk&lt;/keyword&gt;: Study finds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-abstract/40/14/1138/5251907" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in the European Heart Journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; revealed that people who skipped brushing their teeth at night were more likely to develop cardiovascular problems compared to those who brushed regularly. The study suggested that maintaining good oral hygiene might help reduce the risk of heart disease and even heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Kunal Sood’s &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPmocKBAOaa/?igsh=dHZwaWs0YzdrYzFv" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Instagram post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, a double-board-certified medical doctor and general physician, the results are clear enough to highlight a close connection between oral hygiene and heart health. In an informative social media post, he explained that neglecting nighttime brushing could allow harmful oral bacteria to travel through the bloodstream, causing inflammation that affects the heart and blood vessels. Over time, this inflammation can contribute to conditions such as atherosclerosis, where the arteries become hardened or narrowed due to plaque buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the research does not claim that poor oral hygiene directly causes heart disease, it points to a significant relationship between the two. Researchers emphasise that maintaining clean and healthy teeth could serve as a preventive measure for cardiovascular issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How &lt;keyword id="6556047" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="oral-health" source="Orion"&gt;oral health&lt;/keyword&gt; affects the heart&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human mouth naturally contains millions of bacteria, most of which are harmless when kept in balance through regular brushing and flossing. However, when oral hygiene is neglected, harmful bacteria multiply and can enter the bloodstream through bleeding gums or infections. Once in the bloodstream, these bacteria can trigger an inflammatory response from the body’s immune system. Chronic inflammation is one of the key risk factors associated with heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association and several global studies have reported that individuals with gum disease, also known as periodontitis, tend to have a higher risk of developing heart-related conditions. These include coronary artery disease, heart failure, and even certain heart valve infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation caused by oral bacteria may lead to the formation of fatty deposits in blood vessels, narrowing them and restricting blood flow. This can increase the chances of heart attacks and other cardiovascular complications. Hence, keeping your gums and teeth healthy is not just about appearance; it is closely linked to protecting your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dental problems that can raise heart risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor oral hygiene can lead to several dental problems, many of which have been connected to heart health issues:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gum disease (Periodontitis)&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a severe infection that damages soft tissue and bone supporting the teeth. It allows bacteria to enter the bloodstream easily, promoting inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooth loss&lt;/strong&gt;: Missing teeth may indicate long-term gum disease or bone loss, both of which are linked to a higher risk of heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Untreated cavities&lt;/strong&gt;: Decay that progresses deep into the tooth can cause infections, which in some cases may spread to other organs through the bloodstream.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oral inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;: Swelling or redness in the gums signals infection and can increase the body’s inflammatory response, putting stress on the cardiovascular system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These issues highlight how closely dental and heart health are related, emphasising the importance of preventive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Expert recommendations for maintaining oral hygiene&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce the risk of oral and heart health problems, experts recommend following a consistent dental care routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brush at least twice daily&lt;/strong&gt;: Once after waking up and once before bed, using fluoride toothpaste.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Floss regularly&lt;/strong&gt;: Flossing removes food particles and plaque between teeth where brushes cannot reach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use mouthwash&lt;/strong&gt;: Antibacterial mouthwash helps control bacterial growth and keeps breath fresh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit your dentist every six months&lt;/strong&gt;: Regular check-ups help detect early signs of gum disease or decay.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit sugary foods and drinks&lt;/strong&gt;: Sugar fuels bacteria that cause plaque and cavities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid smoking&lt;/strong&gt;: Tobacco products increase the risk of gum disease and other infections.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By maintaining these habits, individuals can significantly reduce oral infections and their potential impact on heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Broader link between oral and overall health&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond cardiovascular health, poor oral hygiene has been associated with other systemic conditions such as diabetes, respiratory infections, and complications during pregnancy. In diabetic patients, gum disease can make it harder to control blood sugar levels, while in pregnant women, it may increase the risk of premature birth. These findings further underline that oral hygiene should not be treated as a minor part of personal health but as an essential daily practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key takeaway&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brushing your teeth before bed might seem like a small task, but it can make a big difference to your health. Studies suggest that maintaining good oral hygiene not only prevents tooth decay and gum disease but may also help protect the heart from inflammation and long-term damage. Regular dental care, a healthy diet, and proper cleaning habits remain essential for overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, flossing daily and using an antiseptic mouthwash can further reduce bacteria that cause plaque buildup and gum problems.

But instead of wrapping it in toilet paper and tossing it into a bin, she put the tampon in a special plastic sample container, screwed the lid on tight and mailed it to an address in Oakland, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The address was that of NextGen Jane (NGJ), a Bay Area-based startup founded in 2014. And now Julia Carr, NGJ’s clinical research coordinator, stands in the company’s lab under a fume hood happily decanting a mixture of the woman’s blood and a preservation solution into a test tube. She will go on to pipette out small amounts to freeze and store for later analysis. NGJ has obtained about 2,500 menstrual blood samples this way – from women volunteering to send in their used tampons – for its research. That Carr is dealing with their period blood does not gross her out in the slightest. “This is a beautiful project for women’s science, and we are exploring a novel sample type,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-p6qh0t"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;[Menstrual blood] is considered waste but in fact it’s a real treasure&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;NGJ is one of a handful of small, mostly women-led “femtech” startups that, alongside a few academic research teams, are in a race to develop blood tests using menstrual effluent collected noninvasively at home. Usually, we use urine, saliva and, of course, blood drawn from our veins to test for a range of medical conditions. The FDA-approved Cologuard test allows people to collect their own feces and send them off for screening for colon and rectal cancer. These groups ask: why not also a fluid that half the world’s population produces monthly for a long stretch of their lives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The big emphasis is on diagnosing gynaecological and reproductive health conditions for people who send in their period blood for analysis. But that blood could also be used to help track hormones, screen for cancers, monitor diseases such as diabetes and boost stem cell research. If Theranos became shorthand for Silicon Valley junk science, its proponents put menstrual-blood testing at the other end of the spectrum: an underexplored sample source whose clinical potential is only now being examined with scientific care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c4f64c19-b693-4831-b0b5-5eaa13caf14b" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;NextGen Jane’s collection kit.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Courtesy of NextGen Jane&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It is an obvious biological specimen that has been totally neglected,” says Christine Metz, who co-leads the Research Outsmarts &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/endometriosis" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Endometriosis&lt;/a&gt; (Rose) project out of the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research at Northwell Health. “It is considered waste but in fact it’s a real treasure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;No one had given much thought to analyzing menstrual effluent – which contains a mix of tissue from the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) as well as circulating blood and vaginal fluid – for the purpose of medical testing until the mid-2010s, when the Rose project and companies such as NGJ arrived on the scene. (“You matter PERIOD,” reads a tag in one of the stalls of NGJ’s arty, graffiti-decorated bathroom.) What &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.m112.018390" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;little work that had been done to test period blood prior&lt;/a&gt; was mostly concerned with distinguishing menstrual from circulating blood, for police forensic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That it was overlooked for so long is not exactly surprising to those in the field. Women – their bodies, their health concerns – have been understudied due to a combination of historical exclusion from clinical research, persistent gender bias and societal stigma around menstruation and reproductive health. Much to do with women’s health research is woefully underfunded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An “ick” factor has slowed research with menstrual blood specifically, according to Renate van der Molen, an immunologist at Radboud University medical center in the Netherlands who uses the fluid to study various gynecological conditions. “It is thought of as dirty, a bit stinky and useless … People hesitate to give a sample,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet tapping menstrual blood makes sense, she says. Not only is it noninvasive and easy to obtain but, most importantly, it is unique in that it contains cells and molecules that reflect the state of a uterus. It can deliver messages to doctors that other bodily fluids may not. It is just “so different” to blood drawn from a vein, says van der Molen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All told, the startups and research groups see huge potential, even if it is early days. And one of the holy grails the field is hotly pursuing is endometriosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="diagnosing-endometriosis" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnosing endometriosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Having an easy test for diagnosing endometriosis would be a breakthrough, says Abigail Trotter, a 23-year-old living with endometriosis from Pennsylvania. That’s why she sent her period blood to NGJ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f5a3a370-6edd-485c-b2ca-f0aa5b8a1bc2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="element element--richLink element-richLink dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":16,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"From 24/7 pain to tolerable symptoms, Botox is helping people living with endometriosis ","elementId":"f5a3a370-6edd-485c-b2ca-f0aa5b8a1bc2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/29/from-247-pain-to-tolerable-symptoms-botox-is-helping-people-living-with-endometriosis"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":18,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Endometriosis – in which tissue similar to the uterus’s endometrial lining grows outside the uterus in spots known as lesions, causing severe pelvic pain and heavy bleeding, and making it harder to get pregnant – is a debilitating disease. It is estimated to afflict more than 10% of women of reproductive age. Not only is there no cure and limited treatment options, but confirming a diagnosis can be a nightmare: the only way to do it is via laparoscopic surgery, typically performed under general anesthesia. Because endometriosis presents differently in different people and its symptoms resemble those of other conditions, it can take years to even get to the surgical diagnostic stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Trotter was surgically diagnosed with endometriosis late last year, after nearly a decade of pelvic pain and period problems. “All the years you go without it being diagnosed it is spreading, wreaking havoc on your inner parts,” she says. The surgery itself resulted in an under-the-skin infection that laid her so low she missed six weeks of work at the veterinary clinic where she is employed as a technician. (She recently underwent further surgery to remove her lesions robotically and is recovering well.) “A surgical procedure just to have it diagnosed … [That] really does need change,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Trotter came across NGJ’s work while recuperating from her diagnostic surgery and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;got in touch to receive a collection kit. She wanted to help other women avoid what she went through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Developing a noninvasive, at-home test for endometriosis became NGJ’s main focus in 2021, though the company had been asking menstruators to mail in their used tampons for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After receiving enough samples, the company started hunting for molecular signals of gynaecological conditions by analyzing DNA, RNA and proteins. Particularly strong differences in messenger RNA, the molecule that tells cells which proteins to make and when, between women with and without endometriosis stood out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2e5aab6d-2e75-4159-9eab-6477f1f40712" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--supporting element-supporting dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Ridhi Tariyal.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Courtesy of NextGen Jane&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We leaned in,” says co-founder and CEO Ridhi Tariyal, noting that the company has fine-tuned its collection kit and is now confirming the approach works. (She remained tight-lipped about which exact biomarkers NGJ is focused on.) Tariyal adds that NGJ’s trove of stored samples provides it with a “jumping-off point” to explore other molecular signals for different gynaecological conditions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other players such as the Rose project are trying to develop a test for endometriosis using a predominately cellular rather than molecular approach, looking for abnormalities in the whole live cells in the period blood of people with the disease. There are differences in the quantity and shape of certain cells in women who have endometriosis versus women who don’t, explain Metz and her co-lead Peter Gregersen. “From that combination we can develop a diagnostic,” says Metz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Rather than tampons, the Rose project collects samples with menstrual cups, so it can get the whole live cells. (Indeed, the perception that period blood is just dead material is wrong.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;So does Katherine Burns, an associate professor of environmental and public health sciences at the University of Cincinnati, who is also working on a test for endometriosis based on a different set of cellular abnormalities, and who herself lives with endometriosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet menstrual cup collection, as it stands, could be a barrier. The cups can be messy, prone to spills and difficult to insert and remove, particularly for someone who has pelvic pain or has not had their period long (endometriosis starts in the teenage years, and the earlier the condition can be diagnosed the better). Developing a more comfortable and less spillable cup is a goal, say Metz and Gregersen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Beyond endometriosis, proponents point to several gynaecological conditions that menstrual blood could help diagnose – including other disorders of the endometrium such as adenomyosis and chronic endometritis, as well as fibroids, polycystic ovary syndrome, and ovarian and endometrial cancers. Many of these conditions also go undetected for years and, in some cases, can only be confirmed through invasive procedures such as an endometrial biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ultimately whichever method proves to be best at detecting endometriosis and when it might become available to buy remains to be seen. All require further studies, including in teens, and none are yet seeking regulatory approval. (While full FDA approval is the gold standard, there is a less tightly regulated but still legitimate &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/in-vitro-diagnostics/laboratory-developed-tests" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pathway&lt;/a&gt; that allows companies to bring tests to market more quickly.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nonetheless, the good news for those with endometriosis, Burns notes, is that there are multiple irons in the fire. “We are all working towards the same goal to help diagnose endometriosis without surgery,” she says. “Do I hope and wish and pray that any of them are correct? You bet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="making-testing-a-reality" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making testing a reality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Beyond endometriosis, some startups and research groups are experimenting with a grab bag of other conditions and period blood collection techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;German startup Theblood, founded in 2022, is exploring how to use period blood collected via a menstrual cup to provide women with health status reports. It envisages an at-home test for hormone levels related to fertility, cycle health and perimenopause, typically done via a standard blood draw. It is also looking at inflammation markers with the aim of identifying patterns that might point toward chronic conditions earlier, and has studied using menstrual blood to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13237212" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;monitor vitamin levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-p6qh0t"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;[Using period blood is] the most overlooked opportunity in women’s health&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In May, researchers at ETH Zürich in Switzerland &lt;a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2025/05/sanitary-towels-morph-into-test-strips.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;unveiled a prototype menstrual pad&lt;/a&gt; with a nonelectronic sensor that changes color in the presence of certain proteins in menstrual blood that could indicate disease, including potentially cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Then there is Qvin, another ambitious Bay Area-based startup also founded in 2014, which may be farthest ahead in the race to make menstrual blood testing a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last year, the company became the first to receive FDA approval for a special menstrual pad and test for women already diagnosed with diabetes to track blood sugar levels – an A1C test but using period blood rather than blood from a vein. The pad has a special collection strip where a small amount of blood pools and dries before it is mailed in to Qvin for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, Qvin has stopped offering the test directly on its website for the time being and pivoted to include a different market: governments and health organizations, particularly in the global south, seeking inexpensive and more convenient ways of detecting diseases for the millions of women they serve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“[Using period blood is] the most overlooked opportunity in women’s health,” says co-CEO Sara Naseri. “We can make it easy for women to get information about what’s going on in their body, and get it early.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="95968930-93ef-44bd-a8b0-63e9f2648fe3" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Qvin’s standing kit and Q-pad for blood sample collection.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Courtesy of Qvin&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But only if Qvin’s pads are able to test a menstrual blood sample for more conditions than diabetes. It is selling its pad system to research institutions and large healthcare companies to encourage the development of more tests, including for endometriosis, and looking into getting additional FDA approvals of its own, like a test for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV), which is linked to cervical cancer and currently screened for with a Pap smear, and another for various sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Indeed, it has &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/qvin-menstrual-blood-diagnostic-device-receives-fda-approval-in-thailand-301736890.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;already secured approval in Thailand&lt;/a&gt; for the former. A big advantage of the pad over tampons or cups is it is the most widely used menstrual product worldwide, says Naseri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kate Clancy is a biological anthropologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where she is using period blood to study endometriosis lesions, as well as author of the book Period,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which investigates the overlooked science of menstruation&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; She has watched with interest as the field unfolds. Some of what she sees, she likes – including using period blood to test for endometriosis. “Conditions that actually affect the uterus I absolutely see a use case; it totally makes sense,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But she is skeptical of menstrual blood testing where a standard blood test already exists, such as A1C for diabetes or hormone testing to assess reproductive health. “Why wait until a person menstruates?” she says, adding that if an argument for the menstrual blood tests is that they increase women’s access to healthcare, the real answer lies in addressing the societal issues that limit access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She also raises a broader concern: while diagnostic tests provide clear answers, definitively confirming or ruling out conditions, a wave of new menstrual blood-based screening tests – which might, for instance, flag signs of cancer or STIs in healthy populations – could end up being burdensome, adding extra steps to confirm results and potentially needless anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And she urges caution around menstrual blood tests marketed more for health and wellness rather than medical purposes. Because they are not making medical claims, they are often less regulated and may sell insights about hormone balance or vitamin levels that have not been clinically validated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We are a ways from good translational work,” Clancy says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-potential-stem-cell-source" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A potential stem cell source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is a “medical miracle” that happens once a month in women’s bodies, when the endometrial lining that is shed during menstruation regenerates, thickening explosively as new blood vessels sprout from existing ones, says Thomas Ichim, a scientist and biotech entrepreneur who co-authored &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1479-5876-5-57" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a 2007 paper&lt;/a&gt; on the discovery of stem cells in menstrual blood. It is stem cells in the endometrium – some of which slough off into period blood – that drive that process. “It’s logical to think that you can use those cells to stimulate blood vessel production in somebody else,” Ichim says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In other words, menstrual fluid does not just have diagnostic and screening potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-p6qh0t"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Menstrual effluent is an intriguing stem cell source … but we are not far enough along to really say more than that&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The big promise of stem cells is that one day they will be used by doctors to regenerate damaged tissue.

And when they were first discovered in menstrual blood, a flurry of research began exploring applications for treating gynaecological disorders, among other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Theoretically, menstrual blood could be a plentiful source of stem cells: donors could give by menstrual cup instead of undergoing an invasive biopsy to harvest them from bone marrow, as is practice now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But little of the initial increase in research ever advanced; according to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2022.957164" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one recent estimate&lt;/a&gt;, just 0.25% of the adult stem cell research in recent years has involved menstrual blood-derived stem cells. Without a solid understanding of their basic utility, these stem cells are likely decades away from yielding therapies, says Brendan Harley, a tissue engineer also at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (he and Clancy are married).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="93bc462f-e319-4a73-bc8d-03227b8390d6" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘Blokes cringe if you talk about it in the pub,’ says researcher Caroline Gargett. ‘[But] menstrual fluid has so much potential.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Andrew Brookes/Getty Images/Image Source&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Menstrual effluent is an intriguing stem cell source … but we are not far enough along to really say more than that,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Fundamental work, he believes, is being held back in the US by the lack of funding and that ick factor– that anything related to menstrual blood is seen as dirty. “I think it has permeated folk’s thinking about using it for regenerative medicine,” Harley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 2004, researcher Caroline Gargett &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod.103.024109" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published her discovery&lt;/a&gt; of stem cells in the human endometrium, setting the scene for their later discovery in menstrual blood. These days Gargett, who works at the Hudson Institute of Medical Research in Australia, uses stem cells from the endometrium in her own work: helping treat pelvic organ prolapse. She says they have greater regenerative potential and longer lived effects than those in menstrual blood, though getting them requires invasive endometrial biopsy. “A lot of people have just gone, ‘well let’s try,’ with stem cells in period blood, without really understanding” the intricacies, she says. (For instance, menstrual blood contains a mixture of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;true stem cells and stem cell-like cells, making it more challenging to isolate a pure, reliable sample.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet she envisions an alternative use for menstrual blood. She would like to grow tiny, personalized models of the uterine lining for women with endometriosis, so-called “organoids”, from the fragments of endometrial tissue in their period blood. Each woman&lt;strong&gt;’&lt;/strong&gt;s “miniorgan” would be stored in a ‘menstrual fluid biobank’ and used to test how they respond to different drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Blokes cringe if you talk about it in the pub,” Gargett says. “[But] menstrual fluid has so much potential.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="264ed676-e624-4893-9fd5-3f1df451da99" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="element element--richLink element-richLink dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":60,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Stained panties, male guards and no privacy: what it’s like to have your period in prison","elementId":"264ed676-e624-4893-9fd5-3f1df451da99","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/24/prison-period"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":18,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Funding remains the biggest hurdle for period blood testing, say those in the field. While NGJ and Qvin, the Bay Area companies, have bagged roughly $20m in funding each since their inception over a decade ago, it is a small sum compared with vast amounts of cash sloshing around in Silicon Valley. The Rose project has no funding in place for the work of developing a better menstrual cup. Burns has had to pause development on her test for endometriosis because it is unfunded. Gargett has not yet secured funding for her biobank, though she continues to try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a spot of good news, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) launched a $10m &lt;a href="https://cgr.mit.edu/2025/07/31/mit-launches-moonshot-for-menstruation-science/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;menstruation science initiative&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. “This is frontier science,” says Linda Griffith, director of MIT’s center for gynaepathology research and the initiative’s leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Meanwhile, NGJ wants to keep the flow of blood incoming: as the startup’s CEO Tariyal, not one to miss an opportunity, says: “If you’re thinking about how you can contribute, give us your tampon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 11:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNRGMzUG92YlFaYlNKME5yb0RzTE1OS29BVGl4cno2Zmhqakl6UXFfMGJJb2cyZjdJdU93STdwb1k1SE9RaWVhd0tvbDhkMW9TSzdzUVZxMF9wdG94MzBJUmVwRnNIQXZ6R1BNNUY1akpfZDlyTnlwRDc4b3JCMHZnM1Q0bTF2Zi01MFRBMW8tcXRvOWRFTTJWOEpoUWdnQWQ5emR4aC1iMFRlY0U</guid></item><item><title>灰发可能是身体避免致命癌症的方式- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/gray-hair-might-be-the-bodys-way-of-avoiding-a-deadly-cancer</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Gray hair is nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, according to a new study by researchers in Japan, the presence of gray hair may be a good sign that your body is naturally protecting itself from  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="178695" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of mouse experiments suggests we've evolved to let go of cells that are at risk of generating tumors at the expense of a little color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our cells are routinely subjected to a barrage of 'genotoxic insults,' or DNA damage wrought by a wide variety of environmental factors. Skin cells bear the brunt of many such affronts, given their role in helping buffer our internal organs from the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/does-stress-really-turn-your-hair-gray"&gt;Does Stress Really Turn Your Hair Gray?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DNA damage can contribute to cell aging as well as to the development of cancer, although the specific genotoxins, signals, and cellular mechanisms involved with the physical signs of aging remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study focuses specifically on melanoma, a type of cancer predominantly found in the skin, where it originates in melanocytes – specialized skin cells that generate melanin, the pigment responsible for skin and hair color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melanocytes themselves arise from  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="178695" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; (McSCs) located within the hair follicles of mammalian skin, where they maintain skin and hair pigmentation via regular regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mice, the researchers profiled the expressions of the tissue's genes to uncover the fates of the McSCs subjected to various kinds of DNA damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of damage known as a double-strand break, in which both strands in the DNA's double helix are severed, the researchers identified a specific response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The McSCs irreversibly differentiated and disappeared, resulting in the mouse's hair turning gray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178766" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178766" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/000011891.jpg" alt="Genotoxic stress and melanocyte stem cell fate" class="size-full wp-image-178766" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/000011891.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/000011891-600x250.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178766" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Under cytotoxic genotoxin exposure, such as X-ray irradiation, McSC self-renewal is impaired, leading to depletion and hair graying. In homeostasis, McSCs maintain self-renewal and pigment balance. Carcinogenic genotoxins, however, promote KIT signaling and alter arachidonic acid metabolism, triggering melanoma. (&lt;a href="https://www.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/imsut/en/about/press/page_00079.html"&gt;University of Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known as senescence-coupled differentiation, or 'seno-differentiation,' this process relies on activation of the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.reth.2025.03.007"&gt;p53-p21 signaling pathway&lt;/a&gt;, which helps regulate cell cycling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, certain carcinogens triggered a remarkably different response. Researchers treated the skin of mice with ultraviolet B (UVB) light and 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA), a potent carcinogen often used to induce tumor growth in laboratory research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When exposed to these carcinogens, McSCs bypassed the differentiation process that occurred after double-strand breaks, even if the cells had suffered DNA damage, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the general benefits of resilience, there is also something to be said for knowing when to quit. For McSCs, bowing out in response to DNA damage may be worth the loss of hair color if it means a lower risk of skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When exposed to UVB or DMBA, melanocyte stem cells retained their self-renewal abilities and continued to clone themselves, the researchers report. This effect is supported by a cytokine called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell_factor"&gt;stem cell factor&lt;/a&gt; (SCF), which is involved with guiding the melanocytes to their proper place in the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secreted in the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="178695" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt;'s local microenvironment, SCF also suppresses seno-differentiation. Instead of containing DNA damage, this increases the risk of tumors developing by encouraging compromised McSCs to carry on.&lt;br&gt;

Graying is a result of seno-differentiation, a protective pathway that helps the body respond to genotoxic stress by eliminating potentially dangerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When this process doesn't take place, however, the resulting survival and proliferation of damaged McSCs may favor melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research will be needed to shed light on the mechanisms involved and to investigate corresponding phenomena in humans, but this already represents a significant leap in understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this insight into the molecular circuits governing McSCs' divergent fates, the study presents a model to help explain key details about the relationship between tissue aging and cancer, the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-025-01769-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d7xov000x27qkevsqbe5t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Monday marks a full year of continuous measles transmission in Canada, a milestone that’s poised to set the country back decades on a global health commitment. Ongoing transmission in the United States puts it among a group of countries that also face scrutiny from international leaders and are at risk of a similar fate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd00043b6nvco5jrkq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All of the World Health Organization’s regions have committed to eliminate measles by 2030, defined by the absence of local virus transmission for any period longer than 12 months. Canada achieved this goal in 1998, but falling vaccination rates set the stage for cases to grow into a massive — and ongoing — outbreak, putting the country and region at risk of losing elimination status.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd00053b6nbvdfu432@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In early November, the Pan American Health Organization, a regional WHO office, will convene an annual meeting of its Measles and Rubella Elimination Regional Monitoring and Re-Verification Commission to formally determine the status of measles elimination across the region.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd00063b6n97e6vukp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A country is no longer considered to be measles free if the virus returns and transmission is sustained continuously for more than a year,” WHO said in a statement. “There are no formal consequences of losing measles elimination status, however having measles again as an endemic disease will have a profound negative impact on communities, including preventable deaths among some of the most vulnerable populations.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd00073b6ntqf0iby2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Countries that lose elimination status will be asked to submit a corrective action plan, which may include efforts focused on intensified vaccination activities, strengthened surveillance and rapid outbreak response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh7w1j1900033b6nl2xnuzdd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2016, the Americas became the first and only region to effectively eliminate measles by ending local spread. Venezuela and Brazil have both lost elimination status since then, only recently becoming reverified after years of “extensive vaccination, surveillance, and rapid response efforts,” PAHO said. The region as a whole regained elimination status last year, but it is under threat again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd00083b6ndlpsxbqh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            International travel was the initial source of the outbreak that started in Canada in October 2024, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. But the country has now had thousands of cases across 10 jurisdictions, including hundreds of hospitalizations and two deaths in infants who were born prematurely with infections they contracted before birth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd00093b6np5gwzrfw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Canada has tallied more than 5,000 cases this year, more than twice as many as the country has recorded in the past 25 years combined. All but 157 cases have been associated with the outbreak, and about 90% of all cases have been among people who are unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000a3b6nt77inqof@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Immunization coverage across the Region is insufficient to stop outbreaks from occurring, and also hides pockets within countries that have even lower coverage. The Region needs to sustain high coverage, quality surveillance and rapid response at all times,” WHO said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh7wkjdv00093b6n8ini9cyt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Canadian leaders are “more consistent” in their support of vaccination than American leaders, said Dr. Dawn Bowdish, an immunologist and professor in the Department of Medicine at McMaster University in Ontario. National surveys suggest that the vast majority of parents still support childhood vaccinations, she said, but health care disruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic, disinformation and misinformation and liberal exemption rules in some provinces have created vulnerabilities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh7x278q000d3b6nkqfrrbqj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The potential to lose elimination status “highlights the severity of the measles outbreak,” Bowdish said. “If you look at the other countries that also have circulating measles, you see that they are countries without strong public health like Canada and they are countries that have been torn apart by war or civil unrest. It is an eye-opener about how you need to have constant vigilance and consistent support for public health in order to fight infectious disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000b3b6nyvncod2w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Canada’s national health agency says it is in regular communication with the Pan American Health Organization about the progress of the outbreak and efforts to contain it. The outbreak has slowed in recent weeks, the agency says, but there were still 30 new cases reported in the latest week of data available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000c3b6nn6pihtj2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And Canada isn’t the only country posing a risk to the region. Six others — including the US and Mexico — have active measles transmission situations that will be discussed at the PAHO commission meeting. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in January to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/politics/trump-executive-action-world-health-organization-withdrawal"&gt;withdraw the US from WHO,&lt;/a&gt; but PAHO says that it expects US officials – both from the CDC and the National Sustainability Commission – to attend the commission meeting on measles elimination next month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000d3b6n7qnc7ng0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In August, local health officials declared that an outbreak centered in West Texas — one of the largest and deadliest in decades — &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/18/health/texas-measles-outbreak-declared-over"&gt;had ended&lt;/a&gt;. The outbreak caused 762 cases over the course of about seven months, according to data from the state health department; neighboring New Mexico also reported 100 cases this year associated with the outbreak. Three people died: two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000e3b6nnildtpmo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But measles counts continue to grow in the US, and ongoing outbreaks in multiple states — including one on the border of Arizona and Utah and one in South Carolina — are being investigated for possible connections to the Texas outbreak. If links are confirmed and cases continue to spread into January, the US will have also lost its claim to the measles elimination status that it earned in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000f3b6nvwnuaevm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers the elimination of measles an &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank"&gt;historic achievement&lt;/a&gt;, credited to a “highly effective vaccination program” in the US and better measles control across the Americas region.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000g3b6nfx03lnw4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But coverage with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine has been declining in the US and Canada for years, with notable dips after the Covid-19 pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000h3b6nwwjgz9j3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last school year marked the fifth year in a row that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/31/health/vaccination-school-requirements-cdc"&gt;MMR coverage among kindergartners in the US&lt;/a&gt; had been below the federal target of 95%, a benchmark needed to prevent spread of the highly contagious disease. And in Canada, &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization-vaccines/vaccination-coverage.html" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from six jurisdictions shows that the share of 2-year-olds who had received at least one MMR dose fell from nearly 90% in 2019 to less than 83% in 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000i3b6niw2q2c3u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In South Carolina, there have been at least 22 cases associated with an outbreak in the upstate region, and more than 100 unvaccinated children were quarantined for weeks after a measles exposure at school. The state health department sent a mobile health unit to the area to offer free MMR vaccination, but uptake has been less than leaders had hoped: Only 21 people have utilized the resource over the past week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000j3b6njqxe4zyn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Although we are pleased that 21 people have chosen to receive the vaccine, the noted increase is largely attributed to adults, which contributes less to herd immunity in school populations where we have seen the greatest spread so far during this outbreak,” ​Louis Eubank, director of the state health department’s Bureau of Emergency Preparedness and Response, said in an email. “We remain hopeful that more parents of unvaccinated children will make an informed decision to take advantage of this opportunity to protect their children from a serious illness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000k3b6nalowdwdv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The measles outbreak along the state line between Arizona and Utah has grown to more than 100 cases since mid-August, spreading largely in unvaccinated communities. Last school year, nearly 1 in 5 kindergartners in the Southwest district of Utah where the outbreak is growing were missing documentation of having received the MMR vaccine — more than any other region and twice as high as the state average.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000l3b6nfyw1o2hn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As measles has spread across the country and locally, public health officials in Utah report a rise in vaccinations: 32% more MMR vaccinations statewide between March and September than in the same period last year. But vaccinations increased only half as much in the Southwest district — up 16% year-over-year — contributing to widening disparities in coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000m3b6nlspuqguq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers from McMaster University say that &lt;a href="https://news.mcmaster.ca/analysis-vaccine-hesitancy-how-social-and-technological-issues-converged-to-spawn-mistrust/" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine hesitancy&lt;/a&gt; is fueled by a “complex blend of personal, social and environmental factors.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000n3b6nidz0knth@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Individual behaviors are influenced by community, both in physical proximity and through social media, they said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000o3b6n5dqzn4p2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Such dynamics can also result in localized pockets of under-vaccination that benefit the unprotected through herd immunity, but also risk unvaccinated groups becoming high-risk clusters if that protection deteriorates,” they wrote in a recent analysis published in The Conversation. ”The COVID-19 pandemic has proven how damaging misinformation, disinformation, information voids and information gaps can be to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(24)00031-8" target="_blank"&gt;public health&lt;/a&gt;, including immunization coverage and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-17430-6" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine hesitancy&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

But the work of the committee isn’t done only by the independent advisers; it is supported by CDC staff and outside experts on working groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC staff provide logistical support and subject-matter expertise, and they make sure the committee follows rules and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The entire department is now “gone”, Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said last week at a press conference with Defend America Action. Only a designated federal official for the group remains, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“CDC scientists are being held hostage by Robert F Kennedy Jr.,” Daskalakis added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;With the ACIP staff, “a lot of what they do is logistics,” said Kevin Ault, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the Western Michigan University Homer Stryker MD School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In recent meetings, “you’ve kind of seen that fall apart”, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some presentations weren’t available for the most recent meeting, and several Zoom links and microphones weren’t working. The language of the votes wasn’t distributed to the public or apparently to the advisers ahead of time, with one committee member objecting to a vote because of the lack of information. With the support staff now gone, such delays and mistakes may worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s not just scientists and staff within the agency feeling the effects of terminations and shakeups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The ACIP’s working groups are often composed of subject experts, local health department officials, and representatives from medical groups in addition to CDC employees. There are usually eight to ten working groups at a given time focusing on pathogens like influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human papillomavirus (HPV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We usually do the very boring job of slogging through the data and deciding what information is most important to present at the public meeting,” Ault said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most working groups have not met in at least six months. Ault was in a meeting for the working group on RSV in June when the news broke that all 17 advisers on the ACIP – some of whom were leading the session – were being fired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“They weren’t informed ahead of time. It was in the Wall Street Journal and somebody happened to be on the call and said, ‘Hey, did you guys know you just got fired?’” Ault said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Since then, Ault has attended no meetings and received little word from staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The only communication I’ve gotten has been usually the day of a scheduled meeting – that it’s been canceled. Other than that, I’ve not gotten much communication at all,” Ault said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ault was an ACIP member from 2018 to 2022. He has been on the flu working group on and off since the flu pandemic of 2009, and he’s chair of the scheduling committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Most of them have not met in six months or more,” Ault said. “It’s been very fragmented and haphazard.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The flu recommendations were published in August despite no meeting of the working group, which meant experts and medical groups had no input on the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Representatives from some groups received an unsigned email in August saying their input was no longer needed. The disinvited groups included the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Other representatives, including from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), haven’t received word on whether they are still participating in the working groups, Ault said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One apparent exception to the pause on working groups is the new Covid vaccine group headed by Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the MIT Sloan School of Management and one of the new vaccine advisers. It’s not clear who is on the Covid committee and whether they are following the usual processes for working groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Working group members have presented data at ACIP meetings since the shakeup. But they’ve been “sidelined”, Daskalakis said. “They’re only, in effect, providing data that frankly is being just criticized and ignored.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A meeting planned for October has been rescheduled “TBD”, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the ACIP website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A vaccine schedule should be published by the CDC by 1 January, and Vaccines for Children – a program that provides vaccines to 52% of children in the US – depends on that schedule, Ault said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Normally, the schedule would have been published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), but that publication is temporarily closed during the government shutdown. And the schedule would’ve been discussed at the October meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“All the vaccines for children and to some extent adults are at risk if that job does not get done in the next two and a half months,” Ault said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Gutting the committee also means promising new vaccines in the late stages of clinical trials may never be recommended, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I don’t know what the future holds for new vaccines that are on the near horizon. The path forward just seems very murky.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;With the termination of ACIP staff, “it’s like the operating system for the advisory committee is gone”, Daskalakis said. “The hardware is there, the software is there” – but there’s no way to make the system run, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The RIFs, which also affected departments like human resources, could limit what happens with the committee in the future, Debra Houry, former chief medical officer for the CDC, said at the same press conference with Daskalakis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If they want to add any new members, HR is gone. The entire HR for CDC is gone. That’s who brings on the special government employees and new FACA [Federal Advisory Committee Act] members,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The ethics office was also entirely let go. If “these folks have a baseline conflict of interest, we’ll never know, because they’re not going to be assessed anymore by the ethics office”, Daskalakis said. “That’s another pretty significant red flag.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQYXFKSWdEdDEwQ3E1QktaYktsTWxab3JBRVpSel9vdS1EanFkS1NCeHJqa3lId01tYi1STlNkVkFjLThXb05lQ0tWUmdDUVZXZDREemVXUlRvOTdpQ1hvaWsxN0Y2QXk5Nl9obGNiX3pCcWFRa2hXdkhfOXZxS3NYZjVUY18</guid></item><item><title>我们询问了医生您需要服用镁多长时间才能睡得更好- Verywell Health</title><link>https://www.verywellhealth.com/magnesium-consistency-sleep-11834843</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium is a go-to supplement for better sleep, but there is confusion around how long you need to take it to see results. We asked our chief medical officer, Sohaib Imtiaz, MD, how consistently you need to take magnesium before you start falling asleep faster. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Q: I just started taking magnesium to improve my sleep, but haven’t seen any results yet. How consistently do I have to take it before I start sleeping better? &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You should only take magnesium if your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/magnesium-blood-test-7974465" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood test shows you are deficient&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s not like you can take it and your magnesium levels will be high immediately. Trials on the effects of using magnesium range from about 20 days to eight weeks, so you can expect to see results within that timeframe if you take it daily.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's safe for adults to take a daily magnesium supplement of 350 mg or less.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Melatonin is released from your pineal gland and helps you fall asleep—it directly impacts that. Magnesium supplements raise the magnesium levels overall, which helps you feel more relaxed and less stressed once your levels are in a healthy range. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, the mechanisms aren't as direct as those of melatonin, which literally acts on the receptors to help you fall asleep. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

She’s a retired, but still feisty, judge who now works as a mediator. And while she wasn’t much of an exerciser when I was growing up in Philadelphia, she now considers herself a “geriatric jock.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do &lt;a class="link" href="https://tools.silversneakers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Silver Sneakers&lt;/a&gt; on Zoom almost every day,” she boasted of her online fitness routine. “Let’s see what they have to show me here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out, a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.thegymvenice.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The Gym Venice &lt;/a&gt;specializes in training bodies over 40-years-old, which have &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2024-10-09/how-to-strength-train-aging-avoid-injury"&gt;different needs&lt;/a&gt;, when it comes to strength training, than younger exercisers, says owner Kris Herbert. For starters, older bodies — especially after years of a sedentary lifestyle — are more susceptible to injuries. Conditions such as osteoporosis and arthritis can lead to weakened muscles, fragile bones and unstable joints as well as balance issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herbert’s gym isn’t the only locale training adults in midlife and beyond. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.stillgotitfitness.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Still Got It Fitness&lt;/a&gt;, in Lomita, and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.q4-active.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Q4 Active&lt;/a&gt;, in Woodland Hills, both train exercisers over 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure m-0"&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;Times staff writer Deborah Vankin, right, and her mother, Sandra Mazer Moss, undergo an “ability test” at the Gym Venice. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Catherine Dzilenski / For The Times)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The niche approach is for good reason. As we age, we also lose muscle mass — as much as &lt;a class="link" href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2025/04/slowing-sarcopenia" target="_blank"&gt;3% to 5% per decade&lt;/a&gt; after age 30, according to the National Institutes of Health — and our metabolism slows, which can lead to weight gain. When strength training later in life, more attention must be paid to building strength around the joints, Herbert says, and strengthening the posterior, or back, chain of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the most part, the clientele here has very sedentary jobs sitting at desks and they [can] get &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2025-01-21/easy-exercises-help-desk-jobs-aches-pains"&gt;tech neck&lt;/a&gt; and their back and posture can get compromised, causing lower back pain,” he says. “So here, it’s all about &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2024-11-12/slow-motion-strength-training-studios-los-angeles"&gt;building skeletal muscle mass&lt;/a&gt; — which helps with metabolism, bone density, regulating hormones, everything — and getting your back and posture strong so you can support yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cool. I’m in!” my mom said. She was wearing her favorite T-shirt, picturing &lt;a class="link" href="https://rosietheriveter.org/?srsltid=AfmBOoqTT2TW2SFu48A_dvkTtK0y_Fr5x2S2kHrIzHC8igqEMXzJjyOe" target="_blank"&gt;Rosie the Riveter&lt;/a&gt; and the text “Nevertheless, she persisted.” “Where do we start?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former guitar shop on Venice Boulevard  — with its bow truss ceiling, exposed wood beams and a polished concrete floor — limits attendance to five clients and their trainers at any given time, so that the environment is calm and visitors can better focus on their workouts — no big-box gym sound system blasting hip-hop, just background chit-chat and the occasional sound of clanking metal from barbells. 95% of the gym’s clientele is between the ages of 40 and 65, with a few clients in their 70s and 80s and several teenagers who come in to work out with their parents. The gym’s trainers — there are seven on staff — are mentored by Herbert, 42, and gym manager Ed Gemdjian, 45. They’re taught how to train older bodies and modify movements when clients have limitations. Then they shadow other trainers before working  one-on-one with clients. Gemdjian also holds weekly workshops on various aspects of training older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They have to have an understanding of our specialized equipment,” Herbert says of his trainers, “as well as how to meet clients where they are — which could mean limited mobility or joint issues — to safely and properly put them through a workout.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Herbert explained all this, my mom nodded enthusiastically. She has both osteoporosis and arthritis and is concerned about her bone density. She’s also had two hip replacements. But after Herbert’s explanation of how his trainers work with clients, she felt she was in good hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He seems to know his stuff,” she said, “especially about issues that women face as they age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our mother-daughter session began as any new member’s would: with a full body assessment followed by mobility and ability tests so that Herbert could design a customized training program for each of us. He had us step on a body composition scanner, which looked like a slender scale. After wiping off our palms and soles (to increase conductivity), we stepped onto it and waited about a minute. Then it printed out a sheet of charts and graphs. It gave us a detailed &lt;a class="link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5771660/" target="_blank"&gt;muscle-fat analysis,&lt;/a&gt; including our total skeletal muscle mass in pounds, our basal metabolic rate (the number of calories we burn at rest), our overall body fat percentage as well as a “segmental fat analysis” that broke down our fat percentage across each arm, leg and on our trunk. Most importantly, it showed our visceral fat level, which means the fat around our organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is huge for disease prevention,” Herbert says. “We’re trying to keep that low.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body assessment was intimidating at first — I mean, who really wants to know the exact percentage of fat on their belly? But my mom found the information empowering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, like, you’d design a special program especially for me?” she said, almost teary-eyed. (I explained that all trainers do that, whether the client is over 40 or not. But still, she was impressed with Herbert and sang the gym’s praises as we moved into the next testing phase.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If I lived here, I could track my progress on the body scanner week to week,” she said, trailing behind Herbert. “I love that!” (Mom’s enthusiastic.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mobility test included our laying on a floor mat while Herbert guided us in doing three lower extremity stretches — a spinal twist, for example — followed by three upper body stretches, such as a shoulder raise, with light bands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that we did the ability test, gauging how we performed different compound movements — meaning multi-joint movements using major muscle groups — on machines or with hand-held weights, cables or bars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure m-0"&gt;

Then we bullet proof your back — make you strong for everyday things, like carrying groceries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mom was down: “Count me in,” she said (a favorite phrase), while checking out her form — and her freshly highlighted hair — in the mirror as she did a bicep curl with a 5-pound weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gym also features special equipment that caters to older bodies. Many of the weight machines are designed to be lower impact, for example, and therefore kinder on the joints. The bench pad used is 4 inches wider than a standard bench pad, eliminating shoulder overhang and protecting the chest and shoulders. They also use “specialty bars” to avoid impact on the shoulders. “So you can push yourself safely, harder,” Herbert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-right&gt;&lt;figure class="figure m-0"&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He walked us over to a hunk of metal glistening by the window. It looked like a medieval torture device … or something you’d see at &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2025-07-27/comic-con-2025-hall-h"&gt;San Diego Comic-Con&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a belt squat machine,” Herbert explained, slipping the padded belt around his waist. “It’s for people with shoulder impingement or spinal compression issues. It takes all the compression off your spine and allows you to perform a squat under resistance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then he pointed to another piece of equipment. “That’s a bilateral leg press,” he said. “You can work one leg at a time if you have imbalances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mom watched, eyes wide with possibility, as if Herbert were showing her a swanky vacation timeshare in Maui.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I could &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;that,” she said. “This place, for someone like me — I have two bionic hips, you know — it feels like a safe space to try something and initially fail, but then with hard work and encouragement eventually be able to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite her enthusiasm, I doubted my mom would join the Gym Venice if she lived in Los Angeles. The gym does offer a $99 weeklong trial that includes a body composition scan, mobility-ability tests and three personal training sessions.

&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis is interesting. Treatment is exciting.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’ve fond memories from early in my career prescribing medications that within minutes relieved patients smothering from congestive heart failure, pulled them back from near death from septic shock, or slowed the progression of their diabetes or heart disease. In my fellowship, my prescription of carbidopa transformed the first patient with Parkinson’s disease I diagnosed. After he went from the “utter misery” of house-bound days to happily walking about the neighborhood with his wife, the couple called me their miracle worker.&lt;/p&gt;

What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_3121566" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3121566" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3121566" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP22055206266652-1723796751.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="mpox virus" fetchpriority="low"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-3121566" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A nurse loads a syringe with the child’s dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine prior to vaccinating a Jackson Public School student at a vaccination station in Jackson, Mississipi, US, on February 16, 2022 [Rogelio V Solis/AP]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-an-mrna-vaccine"&gt;What is an mRNA vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-did-researchers-discover-the-link-between-mrna-and-cancer"&gt;How did researchers discover the link between mRNA and cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-newsletter-slot" data-testid="article-newsletter-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_1553721" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1553721" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-1553721" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AP21302760243116.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="covid" fetchpriority="low"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1553721" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Medical staff transport a body of a patient who died of COVID-19 at the morgue of the city hospital 1 in Rivne, Ukraine, October 22, 2021 [File: Evgeniy Maloletka/AP]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-longer-did-people-live-with-the-vaccine"&gt;How much longer did people live with the vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-it-work"&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_893764" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-893764" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-893764" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2ccf155507c742e595d8797bf6fa7276_18.jpeg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C434&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="China pharmaceuticals lab" fetchpriority="low"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-893764" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A technician inspects anti-cancer drugs in vials at a lab of a pharmaceutical company in Lianyungang, Jiangsu province, China, on March 13, 2019 [File: Stringer/Reuters]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-cancer-patients"&gt;What does this mean for cancer patients?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-did-scientists-find-in-tests-with-mice"&gt;What did scientists find in tests with mice?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 07:41:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxPRTV3d0xSMVlITGlLVGYtaDZUcjZJZjJTY05NSWpGeW1Wd0NxT1V5ZkhfSGtLd29mX0VTTUFBQTI0THJEZEE0ZFBGQm5ZalE4NEdvWG5IbGRDSEo5ZnZkQlFWZmFBa093WVZOblJMejdwTTZsQlY3aHRCMGYtVy1kMGVEV0l0VGdhM2hVNldmaUtGd9IBlwFBVV95cUxPaU9kV0VWdXJ6VTEtQm1HSUcwRkxSWVBBRk9zcEpvTV9Hd1dpM3M0YnQ1OXM3RjQxUFNrVlh4cU1NSVp1SHU4R3NsSWF3QjJ3UUZKT3JUVkx2bENZcEVPMXpUYmFuS3hVMGZDVnVJc1Q2aXZYaDc0Tk85UXBkeXRxUTFPQ3dRcjZEMVpIdVJWUjNva2VKd2Zn</guid></item><item><title>我为自己尝试了彩色步行热潮，结果让我大吃一惊- Creative Bloq</title><link>https://www.creativebloq.com/creative-inspiration/i-tried-the-colour-walking-craze-for-myself-and-the-results-took-me-by-surprise</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p id="f6e2f401-72f0-4b6d-b772-ee42a27873c1"&gt;I'll be honest: when I first heard about colour walking, I rolled my eyes. Another walking trend? Really? Even if it involves &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.creativebloq.com/colour/colour-theory-11121290" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.creativebloq.com/colour/colour-theory-11121290"&gt;colour theory&lt;/a&gt;, I’m not sure I’m interested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, social media's brought us hot girl walks, silent walks, rucking, Nordic walking… And now comes colour walking. And the premise is almost insultingly simple. Before you head out for a walk, pick a colour, and spend your time noticing it in everything around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="f6e2f401-72f0-4b6d-b772-ee42a27873c1-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;That's it. No special equipment, no subscription service, no complicated breathing patterns. Just you, your chosen colour, and whatever your neighbourhood has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;The trend started on &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.creativebloq.com/tag/tiktok" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.creativebloq.com/tag/tiktok"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; back in 2021, though it's been knocking about in various forms for decades. Writer William Burroughs poetically called it "walking on colours," which sounds far more sophisticated than admitting you're following a social media craze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;The idea is that by focusing your attention on seeking out one colour, you naturally become more present, more mindful, and less tangled up in the anxious nonsense that usually clutters your brain. So what happened when I actually tried to do it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-bc90959b-9f1d-4ab8-9970-e39a320e806a" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="starting-cynical-3"&gt;Starting cynical&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="104553ef-1025-4316-8a66-593e7cf06ebe"&gt;First, let me share my general cynicism about this kind of stuff. I've tried meditation apps that promised enlightenment, but delivered only frustration. I've attempted breathing exercises that made me more stressed than before. I've even given silent walking a go, which mostly just made me hyper-aware of how loudly I breathe through my nose. So forgive me for assuming that colour walking wouldn't be for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I was willing to give anything a try. I'd been ill for some time, and although my body had technically recovered, my mind was frazzled. I needed something, anything, to help me feel less like a tightly wound spring about to go boing across my home office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-xFAy6TuE2EZo7rUTbfSC4o" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-xFAy6TuE2EZo7rUTbfSC4o slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I chose blue, mostly because it felt green would be too easy, and headed out. No phone notifications, no podcast, no agenda beyond finding blue things. And blow me down, I actually found myself enjoying myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="f62f78b7-60a8-4043-88db-87d62b9aa707"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="2963cd38-5a5d-4bf4-9666-b730c2e67986"&gt;Within minutes, I found myself genuinely absorbed in the task. There was the obvious blue sky, yes, but then I started noticing things I'd walked past a hundred times without seeing: the forget-me-nots nestled against a garden wall, the vivid blue of a recycling bin, someone's turquoise front door, the way a discarded plastic bag caught the light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't counting steps or mentally rehearsing difficult conversations or wondering what I'd cook for dinner. I was just… thinking about blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, I walked more slowly, noticed more things, and felt genuinely lighter in both body and mind by the time I got home. I've kept it up for a week now, choosing different colours each time, and I'm still enjoying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3f807731-7c8b-49ad-8ea8-f838ef8da706" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-it-works-3"&gt;Why it works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="9aaf5550-85cd-465f-92a5-5d818c294226"&gt;Once I'd found that it works, I was keen to learn why. So apparently, colour walking is effectively because combines physical movement (which releases endorphins) with focused attention (which keeps your mind anchored in the present moment). So it's essentially a moving meditation for those of us who find sitting still frustratingly restrictive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yellow brought unexpected joy when I spotted it in everything from dandelions to crisp packets. Red made me realise how vibrant my supposedly boring neighbourhood actually is. Even taking a punt on grey revealed subtle variations I'd never appreciated before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the biggest revelation? You don't need expensive classes or complicated techniques to feel calm. Sometimes the simplest practices are the most effective…. even if they do come from TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;

But, excess of everything in the body is bad! When excess goes unnoticed, it becomes toxic! In contrast to water-soluble vitamins that are excreted through urine, vitamin D is fat soluble, so it builds up in the tissues with time. When we consume more than we can utilise in the body, overtime this accumulation becomes toxic, and this symptom is medically diagnosed, called as hypervitaminosis D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Doctor Vassily Eliopoulos, one shouldn't go overboard with it as “too much vitamin D can backfire.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Easy ways to increase your Vitamin D intake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vass lists three essential practices that one should consider while taking vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risks of vitamin D overuse&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blindly taking vitamin D can cause calcium to buildup in the body&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excess calcium may damage the arteries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kidneys can be affected, potentially leading to kidney stones&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Check before supplementing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not everyone needs vitamin D supplements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple blood tests can determine if supplementation is necessary&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Correct way to consume vitamin D&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pair it with magnesium for maximum absorption and vitamin k2 which directs calcium to bones and not arteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid supplementing without taking a test&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Four key steps for safe supplementation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get tested&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not follow marketing, know the body's need&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optimise dose and timing for the body&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seek professional guidance, not social media influence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The problem with the Vitamin D excess:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary issue with excess vitamin D involves its impact on calcium within the body. Vitamin D enhances intake of calcium from the intestines into the bloodstream. When the levels of this vitamin become excessively high and enter the unsafe realm, calcium absorption grows out of control, driving blood levels of calcium well beyond the normal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This surplus calcium, or hypercalcemia, is responsible for making vitamin D toxicity lethal. Symptoms may begin mildly, with weakness, nausea, or muscle aching, and gradually escalate to more serious complications such as vomiting, bone discomfort, kidney stones, and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The impact on kidneys&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kidneys tend to be the first organs to suffer damage. They strive to remove excess calcium from the bloodstream and over time can produce calcification of the kidneys and permanent damage. Individuals with vitamin D poisoning usually have elevated urination and thirst because the body attempts to eliminate excess calcium in the urine. Over time, this stress can weaken kidney function and make it more difficult to maintain electrolytes and blood pressure. Ironically, the very substance that helps maintain healthy bones can, in large amounts, weaken the skeletal system by extracting calcium from the bones and leaving it in soft tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Common misconception&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the misconceptions about vitamin D is that toxicity never originates from sunlight or food. The body will automatically control how much vitamin D it will produce from sun exposure, and foods such as fish, eggs, or fortified milk provide a modest dose. The true peril comes with supplements. Since vitamin D supplements are easily found and sometimes sold as energy and immune system boosters, it is easy to overconsume them. Most toxicity cases occur when individuals consume high-dose supplements over months without medical check-up. Taking more than 10,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D per day over a long time can elevate the 25‑hydroxyvitamin D in the blood levels way above safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, a person with excessive vitamin D may not notice anything out of the ordinary. Toxicity symptoms tend to develop slowly. They may consist of nausea, constipation, and dehydration on onset, followed by more chronic issues such as bone pain, abnormal heart rate, and arterial, lung, or kidney tissue calcification. Calcium deposits in places they shouldn't be result in the internal mechanisms of the body becoming stiff and more susceptible to illness. For instance, calcified arteries become less capable of expanding and contracting properly, increasing the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per PubMed central, the signs and symptoms of vitamin D toxicity are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such as difficulty in concentration, confusion, apathy, drowsiness, depression, psychosis, and in extreme cases, a stupor and coma. The gastrointestinal symptoms of VDT include recurrent vomiting, abdominal pain, polydipsia, anorexia, constipation, peptic ulcers, and pancreatitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physicians primarily diagnose vitamin D poisoning through a blood test for calcium and 25‑hydroxyvitamin D. When both are elevated, the disease is diagnosed. Treatment is primarily stopping all supplements of vitamin D outright and cutting calcium intake. In severe cases, intravenous fluids, corticosteroids, or certain drugs known as bisphosphonates are administered to decrease calcium levels immediately. The process of healing takes a long time as vitamin D stored in fat cells is slowly released, so its effects can last weeks or even months after stopping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ideal daily intake for most adults falls between 600 and 800 IU according to NIH, although older individuals or individuals who have very limited sun exposure can require a little more under medical supervision. Ongoing blood levels are the safest method of knowing if supplementation is truly providing benefit. For the majority of instances, healthy vitamin D levels are just a matter of balance. Limited sun exposure, a balanced diet, and occasional supplementation, if necessary, are sufficient to sustain healthy bones and general well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the tale of vitamin D toxicity has a wider message about moderation. Nutrients, like much in life, provide benefits only within a specific range. Too little exposes the body to risk; too much quietly harms.

According to Dr Dmitry Yaranov, MD, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/california-cardiologist-with-20-years-experience-says-you-dont-need-to-cut-out-every-bad-food-to-protect-your-heart-101761446844493.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="cardiologist"&gt;cardiologist&lt;/a&gt;, who specialises in heart failure, advanced heart failure, heart transplantation, and mechanical circulatory support, it does not lead to good results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How can excess protein harm your heart?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an Instagram video shared on October 27, titled ‘This is how a high-protein diet can lead to a heart attack at 35’, Dr Yaranov explained how years on extreme carnivore diets can be detrimental to your &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-says-avoid-these-5-foods-to-reduce-heart-disease-risk-red-meat-high-sodium-diet-sweet-beverages-101761052650721.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="heart health"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote, “He looks like a statue. Shredded. Vascular. Peak performance. But I’ve seen what’s inside those vessels — and it’s not pretty.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to the cardiologist, being on extreme diets like carnivore foods for years can lead to several heart health issues, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sky-high LDL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Endothelial dysfunction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic inflammation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Premature atherosclerosis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Athletic ≠ healthy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Yaranov explained that, though when you are on a high-protein diet, your body on the outside looks like a machine, the inside, in most cases, tells a different story. He added, “I’ve cared for ‘fit’ 35-year-olds with heart attacks. No symptoms. No warning. Just a ticking time bomb.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, he warned that being athletic does not mean that you are healthy. Similarly, low body fat is also not equivalent to being low risk for any of the heart diseases. “A six-pack doesn’t protect you from a plaque rupture. If your diet destroys your endothelium — it doesn’t matter how strong your biceps are,” he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lastly, Dr Yaranov advised that if you really want to be healthy, it’s not about extremes. Rather, it is about finding balance, eating whole foods, preferably plant-based diets, and getting regular blood work done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

They play a key role in many global diets and are often associated with improved heart health, metabolic balance, and overall wellness. However, emerging research highlights a potential link between peanut consumption and liver damage, primarily due to contamination by aflatoxins, toxic compounds produced by fungi during improper storage or processing. These aflatoxin-contaminated peanuts pose a serious risk to liver health, potentially leading to liver cirrhosis or cancer over time. Understanding safe storage, sourcing, and moderate intake is essential to enjoy the nutritional benefits of peanuts while protecting liver function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nutritional value of peanuts and their effects on liver health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peanuts are technically legumes, rich in nutrients that can support general and metabolic health. They contain protein, fat (mostly unsaturated), and dietary fibre. These nutrients help maintain healthy cholesterol levels and improve insulin sensitivity, both of which are beneficial for the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;"Unhealthy Lifestyle Damaging Liver Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these advantages, the risk of liver injury arises when peanuts are contaminated with aflatoxins, a type of toxic compound produced by certain fungi that grow under poor storage conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Aflatoxins in peanuts: The key cause of liver damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What are aflatoxins&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aflatoxins are poisonous substances produced by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, fungi that thrive in warm and humid environments. Peanuts and other crops such as maize are particularly vulnerable to contamination during harvesting, drying, and storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How aflatoxins affect the liver&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once ingested, aflatoxin B1, the most potent form, is metabolised by liver enzymes into a reactive compound that binds to DNA. This interaction causes mutations in liver cells, particularly affecting the p53 tumour suppressor gene, which leads to cell damage, cirrhosis, and potentially hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7693493/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;A study published in Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; noted that while nuts have metabolic benefits, they are at high risk for aflatoxin contamination, which can compromise liver function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcpharmacoltoxicol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40360-020-00420-7" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Another study published in BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;found that exposure to aflatoxins increases the risk of liver cirrhosis by approximately 2.5 times compared to non-exposed individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Overconsumption of peanuts and fatty liver disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond contamination, another question arises: can eating too many peanuts harm the liver through excess fat intake?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peanuts are calorie-dense, and excessive consumption can contribute to weight gain and fat accumulation in the liver, particularly in individuals with metabolic syndrome or poor dietary balance. However, moderate peanut intake has generally been shown to improve metabolic health, not worsen it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7693493/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;A study published in Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;reported that nut consumption, including peanuts, was associated with better liver enzyme profiles and reduced inflammation in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The conclusion was that peanuts do not directly cause fatty liver, but rather may aid in its management when consumed appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the link between peanuts and fatty liver is indirect and dependent on portion size and overall diet quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When peanuts become dangerous: Risk factors for liver damage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aflatoxin contamination: Peanuts stored in humid or warm conditions without proper drying can grow mould, leading to aflatoxin production.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poor storage and handling: Lack of air circulation and exposure to moisture encourage fungal growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unregulated processing: Inadequate testing and safety controls increase contamination risk, particularly in low-resource regions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pre-existing liver disease: Individuals with hepatitis, fatty liver, or cirrhosis are more susceptible to toxin-related injury.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excessive consumption: Large quantities of peanuts or peanut oil may contribute to excess calorie intake and fat accumulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Preventing liver damage from peanuts: Practical safety measures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enjoy peanuts safely while protecting liver health, the following steps are recommended:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buy from reputable brands that perform aflatoxin testing and meet food safety standards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Store peanuts properly in airtight containers, away from heat, sunlight, and humidity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid mouldy or discoloured peanuts; even a small amount of visible mould can indicate contamination.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limit portion size to around 30-40 grams several times per week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diversify nut intake to include almonds, walnuts, or cashews for balanced nutrient variety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discard stale peanut oil or any product with a rancid smell.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consult healthcare professionals if you have an existing liver condition before significantly increasing nut intake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement “peanuts cause liver damage” is only partially correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy, properly processed peanuts do not harm the liver and may even offer metabolic benefits.

In his latest &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/instagram" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; post, cardiovascular research scientist Dr James DiNicolantonio explained, “Recognising these subtle, early signs can make a significant difference in preventing severe cardiovascular events.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the three early red-flags he emphasises and how you can respond to them -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="20949" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="erectile-dysfunction" source="Orion"&gt;Erectile dysfunction&lt;/keyword&gt; as a heart signal&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr DiNicolantonio noteed that erectile dysfunction (ED) may serve as an early warning for cardiovascular trouble and cautioned, “About half of people with heart disease experience erectile dysfunction and it can precede heart disease by up to five years.” Since blood-flow issues in smaller arteries (such as penile arteries) often mirror what can be happening in coronary arteries, ED may reveal hidden cardiovascular risk. If you are experiencing ED, especially with no obvious lifestyle cause, discussing it with a clinician is wise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Heart Attack Warning Signs That Women May Confuse With Menopause Symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="142940" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="shortness-of-breath" source="Orion"&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/keyword&gt; during mild activity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One often dismisses it as "getting out of shape" or "just tired" but Dr DiNicolantonio flags dyspnoea or shortness of breath with light exertion as another key sign and warned, “If climbing a few stairs or doing light exercise leaves you unusually winded, it’s a signal that your heart may be struggling.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pay attention, whether you are parents juggling school runs or professionals managing long days or anyone who notices breathlessness on simple tasks. It may mean your heart is less efficient at pumping blood or your lungs are getting overburdened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

The expert revealed, “Swelling in the feet, ankles, or lower legs can indicate heart failure or kidney dysfunction. Fluid retention is a common but often overlooked symptom of cardiovascular issues.” If you notice persistent swelling (especially alongside breathlessness or fatigue), it is time to see a doctor. It could indicate your heart isn’t effectively pumping blood, causing fluid to pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why these early signs matter&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical research supports the idea that the heart sends whispers long before it crashes into a major event. For instance, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/5-warning-signs-of-early-heart-failure?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a 2023 review from Harvard Health Publishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; identified swelling, fatigue and breathlessness as early heart-failure signals. It is a general tendency for people to ignore heart failure symptoms and attribute them to just getting older but noticing these lesser-known symptoms and starting conversations early may lead to interventions (lifestyle, medical or both) that delay or prevent serious disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

It can flick a light switch early, sometimes via unusual signs. Swelling in ankles, unexplained breathlessness or a shift in sexual health might be your body’s early alert.

According to studies, oranges provide a rich supply of vitamin C that supports the structural integrity of eye tissues. This helps especially with preventing early clouding of the lens, one of the steps toward cataract formation. Vitamin C is concentrated in the eye lens and acts as an antioxidant. Over a lifetime, oxidative damage to lens proteins is a major driver of cataract formation but vitamin C helps slow that damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25735187/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2016 meta-analysis in Acta Ophthalmologica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that “higher vitamin C intake and serum ascorbate might be inversely associated with risk of cataract.” In plain terms, people who consume more vitamin C tend to have lower rates of cataract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Pair vitamin C foods with healthy fats (yogurt, nuts) to improve absorption of other eye nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="20316214" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="papaya" source="keywords"&gt;Papaya&lt;/keyword&gt;: The tropical fruit that helps with dry eyes and inflammation&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your eyes often feel tired, dry or itchy, it might be more than screen-time and papaya brings in nutrients that help reduce eye inflammation and combat dryness in the eyes. It is a go-to fruit when your eyes feel overworked. As per the studies, papaya supplies vitamin A precursors and other carotenoids, plus anti-inflammatory phytonutrients. Carotenoids support retinal and lens health and reduce chronic low-grade inflammation that helps preserve eye tissue over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889157521001848" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Analyses of papaya in a 2021 carotenoid composition study by Food Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; confirm it as a good source of carotenoids and show bioaccessibility varies by variety but overall papaya offers lutein/zeaxanthin precursors and antioxidants useful for eye health. The broader nutrition literature highlights papaya’s anti-inflammatory nutrients that can lower oxidative stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, dice papaya into breakfasts or smoothies or pair with lime and chia for a quick anti-inflammatory snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="125932" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="kiwi" source="Orion"&gt;Kiwi&lt;/keyword&gt;: The green shield for your retina&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t overlook kiwi. This green fruit contains plant compounds that support retinal health, especially protective against degeneration that can affect vision clarity over time and is part of the mix for sharper, healthier vision. Kiwi is unusually high in vitamin C and contains lutein/zeaxanthin along with other antioxidants that are a neat package for both lens protection and macular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviews of kiwifruit nutrition highlight its high vitamin C content and a supportive nutrient profile that can benefit eye health and general metabolic wellness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6267416/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Clinical and observational evidence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; links dietary lutein/zeaxanthin (the carotenoids found in kiwis and leafy greens) with better macular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, slice a kiwi after dinner as a refreshing dessert, toss into salads or blend into green smoothies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why diet matters more than you think for eye health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us associate vision problems with needing glasses or age catching up but behind that are physiological changes like oxidative stress, inflammation, blood-vessel damage and wear and tear on lens proteins. A diet rich in protective nutrients directly addresses these processes. According to the fruit studies, just including these fruits (with their vitamins, antioxidants and beneficial plant compounds) can make a meaningful difference in how your eyes feel and function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, if you are spending long hours on digital devices or living in a polluted/regional-smog context (hello big cities), or have diabetes/high blood sugar (which affects eye vessels), then the need to optimise your diet grows stronger. Make sure you pair fruit intake with other good practices for eye health. Take breaks from screens every 20 minutes (the 20-20-20 rule: look 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes), ensure adequate lighting, control overall blood sugar and get annual eye check-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The takeaway&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your eyes are not just passive observers, they reflect what is going on inside your body and while you cannot reverse all age-related eye changes, you can hit “pause” on a lot of the damage with smart diet and lifestyle moves.

Vaping is dangerous, drinking is dangerous, stress is the silent killer, but when a heart surgeon puts them in order of just how dangerous he believes they are, coming from what he sees in the operating theatre, it hits differently. Cardiovascular surgeon Dr Jeremy London recently ranked five everyday lifestyle habits on just how bad he believes they actually are for our wellbeing. The revelations are eye-opening and also oddly empowering because knowledge is always the beginning of change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaping — 10 out of 10&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaping might be cool to behold, fruity-scented, and nicer than cigarettes, but in your body, it's just as toxic. Dr London gives vaping a score of 10 out of 10 for harm. He describes why vaping is so deceptive because individuals think it's a "healthier alternative." Really, though, it's just a different way of administering chemicals that still damage blood vessels and heart tissues. He has seen young patients that have never had a cigarette, but vape every day, develop signs of cardiovascular stress at an early point. The illusion of safety makes it even riskier because they legitimize addiction under a new label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 Things that show you have a healthy heart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stress — 8 out of 10&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress is not necessarily bad, admits Dr London. The stress that compels you to meet deadlines or work yourself to the bone at practice sometimes toughens you up. But when stress becomes chronic, when it tips over into anxiety, burnout, or emotional exhaustion, it starts to nibble away silently in the heart. He calls stress an "invisible injury." You can't see it, but it affects everything from blood pressure to the sleep-wake cycle to food cravings. Chronic stress leads to inflammation, and inflammation is where disease typically begins. He rates it an 8 out of 10, not because it'll kill you, but because it slowly rots away at your health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Soda — 4 out of 10&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soda is not as bad as the rest, but Dr London still does not award it less than 4. He doesn't consume it himself, not just due to the sugar, but due to the addiction habit. The sweet drinks elevate your blood glucose, push the body towards insulin resistance, and ultimately to metabolic issues. Even diet soda isn't safe-he says it leaves people craving junk food, creating a vicious cycle. Soda might not be on the top of the threat list, but it's an insidious part of bad nutrition and unstable energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep deprivation — 10 out of 10&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep, according to Dr London, is not an indulgence. It's a matter of medicine. He gives poor sleep a 10 for harm. The reason is simple-if you don't rest, your body doesn't repair itself. Hormones get out of balance, blood pressure rises, and the heart works too hard without rest. He says even he's had his own struggles with bizarre sleep patterns and seen how quickly it can affect mood, focus, and energy. Sleep deprivation not only makes you feel miserable but actually helps you live longer. It's one of those health determinants where folks don't want to believe in it until it gets them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alcohol — 10 out of 10&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final one on his list, is kind of an old-school one, alcohol, also gets a 10. That might be surprising for some given how prevalent social drinking is. But Dr London makes the point that alcohol damages at the cellular level — specifically brain and heart cells. It interferes with sleep, increases blood pressure, and in most cases, leads to addiction. Research now suggests that moderate drinking can increase the risk of dementia and cardiovascular disease. He describes the impact of alcohol as cumulative. Each leaves behind a residue, and after decades, those residues add up to create dramatic damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you look at the list, the message is clear, it's not necessarily what we're putting into our bodies, but how often we expose ourselves to damage. Vaping, sleeping, and booze all take the number one spot because they're both short-term and long-term risk. Stress follows soon after, triggering every other habit on the list. Even soda, which may seem insignificant, is how rapidly we can turn the norm out of something that should not be part of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. London's ranking game is a revelation, it is not to scare people off, but to help them make what is the most important a priority. His advice is quite simple: Pick one habit, try and discover its triggers, find replacement. Replace vaping with breathing breaks, replace soda with flavored water or fresh juice. Replace late-night scrolling with a bed-time practice. And most of all, tune in to yourself, stress and fatigue usually arrive way before disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>研究将无糖饮食饮料与更高的2型糖尿病风险联系起来- VINnews</title><link>https://vinnews.com/2025/10/26/study-links-sugar-free-diet-drinks-to-higher-type-2-diabetes-risk/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="post-613102" class="post-613102 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail category-breaking-news category-health category-world" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Article"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA (VINnews)— Drinking one can of Cola Zero or other sugar-free “diet” drinks daily may increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes by 38%, according to a comprehensive 14-year study from Monash University. The findings, reported by ScienceAlert, reveal a higher risk compared to regular sugary soda, which carries a 23% increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong class="whatsapp-promotion-mobile"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers adjusted for factors such as diet, exercise, and body weight, suggesting the elevated risk is not solely tied to obesity. The study points to artificial sweeteners, commonly found in diet drinks, as a potential culprit. These sweeteners may disrupt the gut microbiome and impair metabolism, contributing to the development of Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, which tracked participants over 14 years, underscores the need for caution with sugar-free beverages marketed as healthier alternatives. Instead, researchers recommend water as a safe and effective hydration option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those looking to reduce their diabetes risk, swapping diet drinks for water may be a simple yet impactful choice. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind artificial sweeteners’ effects on health.&lt;/p&gt;

They had seen all the illnesses and tantrums. However, nothing prepared them for the odd behaviour of their youngest daughter, Austyn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child was "just not happy," and "never content," her mother told CBS News. Austyn never slept and cried constantly as an infant. As a toddler, she was "never smiling, never laughing," her mother added. The child had mild developmental delays and a tremor. After months of sleepless nights and growing concern, the family turned to genetic testing. When the results came back, they were shocked. The 18-month-old Austyn was diagnosed with Chiari malformation, a rare brain condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Surprisingly easy ways to protect your brain and prevent stroke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Chiari malformation?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the NHS, a Chiari malformation occurs when the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chiari-malformation/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;lower part of the brain pushes down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; into the spinal canal. This is a rare condition. Chiari malformation affects about 1 in 2,000 people, as per Dr. David Harter, director of pediatric neurosurgery at NYU Langone, Most are born with it, and while its exact cause remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conditions are caused by problems in the structure of the brain and skull. There are 4 main types, but type 1, called Chiari I, is the most common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Chiari I, the lowest part of the back of the brain extends into the spinal canal, leading to pressure on the brainstem and spinal cord, and obstructing the flow of fluid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="29905521" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="symptoms-of-Chiari-malformation" source="keywords"&gt;Symptoms of Chiari malformation&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In many people, Chiari I malformation will not have any symptoms. It is often found after an MRI scan of the brain. As per the NHS, in those who develop symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;headaches - mostly at the back of the head and may be brought on or made worse by coughing, straining, sneezing or bending over&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;neck pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;dizziness and balance problems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;muscle weakness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;numbness or tingling in the arms or legs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;blurred vision, double vision, and sensitivity to light&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;swallowing problems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;hearing loss and tinnitus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;feeling and being sick&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;difficulty sleeping (insomnia) and clinical depression&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who develop syringomyelia may also experience problems using their hands, difficulty walking, pain, and problems with bladder or bowel control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sisters diagnosed with the same condition &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Further tests revealed that Austyn’s spinal cord was under severe compression, blocking the flow of spinal fluid. She needed brain surgery. Dr. Jeffrey Greenfield performed a decompression surgery in March 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the surgery, Austyn woke up different. “She was ready to go. She was trying to get out of bed, and she was trying to walk. She was smiley. It was like the pain she'd always felt was gone, and the pain of surgery didn't match what she'd always felt. She was just ready to run laps around the ICU,” the mother recalled. “When we did the follow-up with Dr. Greenfield, I told him, ‘You gave me her laugh.'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the family thought their challenging days were behind, 3-year-old Amelia fell sick. This was just five days after returning home. They thought it was Lyme disease and took her to the hospital, only to find that Amelia also had Chiari malformation, along with a tethered spinal cord, which, according to the NIH, is a condition in which the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/tethered-spinal-cord-syndrome%5C" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;spinal cord attaches abnormally&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; to surrounding tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amelia underwent two surgeries in October 2023, both performed by Dr. Greenfield. She recovered quickly, but the family’s ordeal was far from over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Trump’s Bizarre Dance At Malaysia Airport Sparks Health Speculation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long after, the couple noticed their 7-year-old daughter, Aubrey, was being unusually moody and suffered frequent urinary infections. Recognizing the pattern, the mother pushed for an MRI, and her instincts were right. Aubrey, too, had both Chiari malformation and a tethered spinal cord. The child underwent surgery in November 2023. “She was our happy kid, and it was like one day we were losing her,” Ashlee said. “After surgery, we got her back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then came the next. 11-year-old Adalee, who had long complained of leg pain, was diagnosed with the same conditions. Adalee underwent surgery in March 2025 and made a strong recovery, even joining her school’s dance team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor explained that 10% of Chiari malformation cases have a genetic link; however, it’s rare for multiple siblings to share the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eldest two children tested negative for the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;Doctors now have new tools &lt;a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/understanding-ms/what-is-ms/how-ms-is-diagnosed/2024-mcdonald-diagnostic-criteria"&gt;to diagnose multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, or MS, earlier, sometimes even before a person experiences the symptoms of the autoimmune disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MS is a disease where the immune system attacks the protective covering around nerves known as myelin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can now diagnose MS before someone even has a symptom. It’s really earth shattering,” said Julie Fiol, the associate vice president of Clinical Innovation and Strategy at the National MS Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new guidance for neurologists comes in updates to the McDonald criteria, the checklist doctors use to diagnose MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors now check the optic nerve, the part of the eye that helps you see, for damage. Even if someone hasn’t noticed vision problems, scans like an MRI or OCT, which is a special eye scan, can reveal signs of MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doctors in the past often waited for a second MS episode to confirm the diagnosis, that’s no longer required if other signs are present. “We no longer require someone to have what was called dissemination in time… that’s one way that we’re helping people get to an MS diagnosis more quickly,” Fiol said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether someone is a child or an adult under 50, the same criteria now apply when reaching a diagnosis. This makes diagnoses more consistent and helps avoid delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors can now use special brain scans to look for signs like a central vein or a dark rim around lesions, which are features that help confirm MS and rule out other diseases. There’s also a newer spinal fluid test called the kappa free light chain (KFLC) index, which is easier to get in some places and helps doctors make a more accurate diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone has brain scans that look like MS but no symptoms, they may still be diagnosed if other tests support it. This helps catch MS even earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The treatments we have work best when started early,” Fiol said. “We’re helping people get to a diagnosis more quickly and with more certainty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis symptoms can vary widely, but common ones include fatigue, vision problems, numbness or tingling, muscle stiffness, known as spasticity, as well as walking difficulties. Some people also experience cognitive changes, dizziness and bladder issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to vision, MS can cause pain with eye movement, blurred vision, dim vision or even loss of color when it comes to what a person sees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people already living with MS, these changes won’t affect their diagnosis, but their experiences helped shape the new guidelines. Their stories, according to Fiol, pushed researchers to find better ways to diagnose MS faster and more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiol said the updates mean more people can get answers sooner, no matter their age or where they live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want people to feel reassured that if they were to develop symptoms, for most, they will be able to reach a diagnosis more quickly — and to have greater certainty in that diagnosis,” Fiol said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia spends a lot of time thinking about the last years of his life – and yours too. He's declared war on what he calls the marginal decade, the final years of life that are plagued by sickness and immobility. It's not often that 60 Minutes does a story on a physician who has fewer than 75 patients, but the Stanford-trained Attia has become both a pioneer and a star in the growing field of longevity medicine. His stark diagnosis – and advice on what to do about it – have attracted millions of followers, and billionaire patients who pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to hear the words "Dr. Attia will see you now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: At 75, both men and women fall off a cliff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: At 75?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: At the population level, it's unmistakable what happens at the age of 75. That's what we're up against. That's what I'm thinking about in the practice is, how do I create an escape velocity that gets somebody another 15 years there? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: And so is your goal to minimize or essentially erase that marginal decade?&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: The marginal decade's not going anywhere. We will all have a final decade of life. My goal is to make the marginal decade as enjoyable as possible. The way I explain it to my patients is, that last 10-15 of your years, if you don't do anything about it, you will fall to a level of about 50% of your total capacity, cognitively, physically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: And when people hear that you're like, "I don't wanna be that. That's not how I want to spend the last decade of my life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: That's right. A lot of people respond that way as though they're hearing this for the first time. Although if you ask them, "Haven't you seen people in this state?" They'll say, "Well, yeah, I guess I have."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: Right. Likely their own relatives.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: Sure. Their own parents even.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: So do you consider yourself a new kind of doctor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: No, I don't think so. What we're doing is creating a framework that fits directly into this idea of how to train for the marginal decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That training begins here in Austin, Texas, where Attia is based. This is where his patients go through two days of physical evaluation, and where we found, after just a few hours, how intense the 52-year-old doctor and his methods are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: I think this is the neglected part of medical testing, is how fit are you, how strong are you, how well do you move? And in many ways, these tests are even more predictive of how long you're going to live than what I might get out of your bloodwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: How do we know that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: The data are pretty clear. When you look at things like cardiorespiratory fitness, when you look at muscle mass, when you look at strength, they have a much higher association than things like even cholesterol and blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Attia and his team say the key indicator of overall health and longevity is a test called VO2 max. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like the name of a sports car, but essentially it's a measurement of the size of someone's engine, and their capacity to use oxygen to generate power with their muscles, heart and lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Luke Bennett - "There you go, that's the hardest part of your day done."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: Even though you say I-- I scored fairly well on my VO2 max &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Luke Bennett - "There we go, 42.1" &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Norah O'Donnell - "OK that's good!" &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: You say I'm still not good enough for Dr. Peter Attia. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: Yes, your VO2 max was gonna place you at the 85th percentile for women your age. And I think it's worth taking a victory lap. But tomorrow, we should come back and plan on what we're gonna do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: You think anyone, whether they're 45 or 65, should be training like athletes. Not for the Olympics but essentially for advanced age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: Absolutely. Life is a sport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Attia says the best drug to delay physical and cognitive decline is exercise, and he takes it in large doses. He aims for about 10 hours a week: cardio to burn fat; intense intervals for VO2 max; and weightlifting to maintain strength and muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He developed his program after turning his back on the medical establishment nearly 20 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While training to be a cancer surgeon at Johns Hopkins he got burnt out caring for so many terminal patients. He quit his residency, and became a management consultant. After becoming a father and discovering he was at risk of developing diabetes, he made big changes, personally and professionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: After my daughter was born, all I could think about was, "Oh my God," like, "I wanna-- I wanna have as much time as possible on this planet with this baby." &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc6" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",6]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's when he decided to become his own first patient in a new specialty: longevity medicine. Today he considers himself neither a primary care physician nor a provider of concierge care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Dr. Attia is prescribing is a radical change in how Americans think about their own health care, driven by the patient, focused on prevention — a practice he calls "Medicine 3.0." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: We're dying of heart disease, we're dying from stroke, cancer, dementia, Type II diabetes, and we I think have sort of come to realize that, "Hey, the playbook of Medicine 2.0 which is treat a disease when a disease is present, doesn't seem to work as well." And so the first principle of Medicine 3.0 is you have to take a much longer arc on the prevention of chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means using existing diagnostic tools in novel ways, like the DEXA scan, that checks bone density, as well as muscle mass and body fat. It typically costs under $300 and Attia says it's, quote, "almost criminal negligence" most women don't get one until they're 65. Another scan he employs is more costly, and not covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: There are certain things that you recommend that are controversial, like regular preventive full-body MRIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: Early detection matters. The earlier you can treat a cancer, the smaller the burden of the tumor at the time of treatment, the greater your odds of success. Now, let's talk about the flip side of that because it is going to detect a lot of things that are not cancer. That means you have a lot of false positives. If you're not willing to go through that experience, as traumatic as it is, you should not engage in this level of screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: Do you get them?&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc7" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",7]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: I do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also suggests patients get tested for the APOE gene, related to risk for Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019 Dr. Attia oversaw genetic testing for actor Chris Hemsworth, who learned he was eight to ten times more likely to develop Alzheimer's than the average person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, Dr. Attia sees fewer than 75 patients, and there's a long waiting list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: And how much does it cost?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: It is a six-figure program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: Like, $100,000, or $500,000, or $800,000? 'Cause that's a big range.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc8" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",8]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: Much closer to $100,000 than $500,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: That's a lot of money. I mean, what do you get for that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: Well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: You don't get-- I mean, you don't live forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: Nope. You're getting access to me, a team of a couple other physicians, a strength and conditioning team, a nutrition team. And what you're really getting is a path to help you achieve your goal of living longer and living better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pitch has proved extremely popular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His book "Outlive,"  part memoir, part medical manifesto, has sold nearly three million copies, and made him a top draw at longevity medicine events like this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And his podcast, that's been downloaded over 100 million times, tackles a wide range of topics, including menopause and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Attia wants his patients to eat a lot of protein — more than double what the current nutritional guidelines recommend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor and a handful of his patients have also taken a drug called Rapamycin that's FDA-approved for use by transplant recipients. The drug has extended the lifespan of mice, but Dr. Attia&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;stopped taking it, for now, because it gave him mouth sores, which can be a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are physicians, including a respected professor of public health we spoke to, who are skeptical that his extraordinary regimen will result in an extra decade of healthy life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: When a fellow physician calls some of what you're talking about, "Hocus pocus"?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: People are entitled to think what they want. And just because someone is a physician, doesn't mean they're even remotely equipped to evaluate the merits of exercise physiology. Remember, I went to Stanford Medical School, right? How many hours of education do you think I received on exercise?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: Probably, a few hours?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: Zero hours. And how many hours did I receive on nutrition? Zero hours. It was 25 years ago, so, maybe things have changed. But I'm pretty sure that if you're talking to other esteemed physicians, they're in the same bucket as me. So, you know, they might not be the ones that are best equipped to be my critics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our last morning in Austin, Dr. Attia took us for a ruck, a hike with weighted backpacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: This, to me, is as much about mental health and socialization, being in nature. And rucking is simply a vehicle to get that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: How much work do you do on your emotional and mental health? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: A lot. I mean, it's-- as much a practice as what I put into exercise or, you know, blood work, and cancer screening, and all the other things that make up physical health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attia has been open about dealing with depression and anger stemming from abuse he suffered as a child. Through therapy, including two stays at inpatient care facilities, he says he turned a corner about five years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: By working hard on our physical health, we can reduce the rate of decline. But if we're being deliberate and active on our emotional health, it can actually improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says progress was only possible because his wife of more than 20 years, Jill, stood by him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: There is plenty of data on longevity and people-- living long that have very strong relationships. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: Yes. Just like the exercise data, I don't think this is just a correlation. I really think that there is also some causality that flows from the end of having great relationships to living a longer life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: What's the point of living long if you don't have people to share it with?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: What's-- or– "What's the purpose of living longer if you're unhappy?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Attia plans on launching a new digital health app next year. He says that 80% of his program does not require a physician, and is adamant it's never too late to begin delaying the inevitable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: How long do you want to live?&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc12" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",12]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: You know, I want to live to be old enough to have a meaningful relationship with as many of my grandkids as I can. That probably means, making it into my 90s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: 'Cause you must be plotting that with your VO2 max?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: Yeah. You know, it's funny, we do an exercise with our patients, which is called the timeline exercise. So if we were doing this for you, we would draw-- you know, we would draw a line for Norah. So you're 51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: And then, I would draw a tick at 61, 71, 81, 91, 101, and then, we would draw all three of your kids. And then, we would start to extrapolate, when do you think they're gonna have kids? And so you're gonna draw their first grandkid, and we're gonna map your life out, according to this timeline. And you're gonna see, pretty quickly, what it's all about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norah O'Donnell: That really kind of puts it in great perspective for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Attia: So, yes, I've mapped my life out, in that regard. And I know that the difference between being 80 and 90 is huge, in terms of what I can have with those kids.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Only since November last year has she been able to eat properly and return to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eating is never going to be the same for me and you are always worrying about something coming back,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t know that I should be looking at my tongue or sticking my tongue right out my mouth to properly look at what’s going on. I didn’t even know that I had anything there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have anything you need to book a test straight away. Obviously it depends if the dentist is trained, which mine luckily was.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Diagnosed with breast cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has now been diagnosed with breast cancer and has been undergoing therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately I have been diagnosed with breast cancer now which is totally unrelated to the mouth,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have been going through chemotherapy. But I think I am doing ok.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mouth Cancer Foundation charity said more than 3,600 people died of mouth cancer last year nationally – a 20 per cent rise over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New cases of mouth cancer in the UK reached 10,825 last year – an increase of 38 per cent in the last decade and by 133 per cent compared with 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than two-in-three (68 per cent) of mouth cancers in the UK are diagnosed in men.&lt;/p&gt;

There’s also a school of thought in nutrition that white rice is the poor choice because it’s lower in fiber than brown rice. But it isn’t that simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The truth is, white rice is accessible, convenient, quicker to cook, and a staple for many communities of color that has received a lot of judgment from “a foundation in racism and whiteness because brown rice is seen as the elite choice for nutrition and is found readily in stores in affluent areas,” explains &lt;a href="https://thetessanguyen.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tessa Nguyen, MEd, R.D., L.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tessa Nguyen, MEd, R.D., L.D.N.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, professional chef, registered dietitian, and founder of Taste Nutrition Consulting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Both types can be used interchangeably in recipes, but white rice tends to be softer and fluffier while brown rice is heartier and slightly chewy, she adds. Calorically and carbohydrate-wise, the two types of rice are very similar.

Because brown rice is a complex carbohydrate, it also provides vitamins and minerals (like iron) and can provide more energy than white rice, Perez says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Perez says the whole bran and germ can also deliver antioxidants and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28274454/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:phytonutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;phytonutrients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which, paired with fiber, can support gut and immune health, as well as cardiovascular health. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6025443/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; show that brown rice contains phenolic acids, which are the most common antioxidants in our diet that reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Cons of brown rice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On the flip side, brown rice may be difficult to digest because it contains an anti-nutrient known as phytate that can hinder your body’s ability to absorb certain minerals from food, according to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33336992/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;one study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

And although brown rice has more fiber, white rice still has some, which is worth pointing out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“One of the most important benefits of white rice is that it is integrated into many cultural cuisines,” Perez adds. “White rice is surrounded by tradition, family, and connection. It goes beyond just physical nourishment. Being able to keep parts of your culture alive absolutely feeds you mentally and helps fulfill you too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you don’t add fat (say, in the form of butter), white rice is low in calories and paired perfectly with with vegetables or lean protein. Our experts note that it also may be easier to digest than brown rice because of its lower fiber content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Cons of white rice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;White rice may increase blood sugar, especially if over-consumed, as it’s higher on the glycemic index, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22422870/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;one study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; noted. The aforementioned processing could mean it has less nutrients, but many brands are re-enriched with the good stuff. Lastly, white rice is not as good as a source of fiber as brown rice is, and fiber is “sorely lacking in most Americans’ diets,” says &lt;a href="https://drjanet.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Janet Brill, P.h.D., R.D.N., F.A.N.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Janet Brill, P.h.D., R.D.N., F.A.N.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian and author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307339114?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.68858435%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cholesterol Down;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cholesterol Down&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Is white or brown rice healthier?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Eating brown rice is a great way to increase your whole grain intake, but both have their benefits, Perez says. When it comes down to it, Perez suggests choosing whichever you love to eat and making sure &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;elements of your plate meet your nutrition goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;White rice is rarely consumed on its own, and you have an opportunity to pack in a ton of nutrients with the other ingredients like fresh vegetables and lean protein, so the type of rice doesn’t make that much of a difference, Perez says. It can come down to personal preference. “People should make food choices based on affordability, accessibility, current health status, and cultural relevance,” Feller says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Can I eat rice every day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If someone wants to eat rice each day it’s absolutely ok,” Feller says. “There are a number of cultures around the globe that eat rice as a staple part of their pattern of eating.” As with any food, Brill says portion control is important for those looking to maintain or lose weight, and if you are managing your blood sugar, consult your doctor or a dietitian about eating it in ways that work for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Why did people stop eating brown rice?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You may have heard of people steering clear of brown rice after a February 2025 study detected arsenic—a toxic element that is part of the earth’s crust and ends up in soil, water, and the environment—in a lot of it. In its inorganic form, arsenic is considered a carcinogen, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/arsenic" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:World Health Organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. However, the brown rice tested in the recent study contained arsenic because of where it was grown, and because it isn’t processed and therefore stripped of its natural state. Therefore, the study found that these small potential exposures posed no acute public health risks to the general American population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With that being said, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fletsliveitup.com%2Fpages%2Fdestini-moody&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fa68858435%2Fbrown-rice-vs-white-rice-benefits%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Destini Moody, R.D., C.S.S.D., L.D.;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Destini Moody, R.D., C.S.S.D., L.D.&lt;/a&gt; dietitian at Live It Up says she doesn’t see brown rice disappearing. “I actually feel as if brown rice is more popular now than I’ve seen it in my professional career,” she says. “I believe this has something to do, in part, with more public awareness about the health benefits of eating for more controlled blood sugars.” People are also wanting to eat less refined grains in excess, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What is the best rice for weight loss?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Even throwing in the likes of black, red, and wild rice, I’d still say brown rice is the best for weight loss,” says Moody. “Though all rice is similar in calorie content, the high fiber content of brown rice means it hangs out in the stomach for longer, making the meal feel more satisfying for a longer period of time. This level of hunger control can help one eat less throughout the day and can prevent one from feeling as if they are starving while dieting in a calorie deficit.” The consumption of brown rice has even been linked to &lt;a href="https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-016-0126-4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lower body weight;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;lower body weight&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Lifestyle Canada</author><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 21:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxNbzNDZlBjWDYtSmc0M045TlFjbmcwN3dHS0R6N2p6VHNTcHpGTFdBTjVzN09QRktCbmRtdVlNYldkc2Nfd2ZkTGV1Nm1SSzhSNG51bU1tTkNvb1kzMU1UYm5yZkpoV1B5RmhHRVdnbmlNNExlekJjcTk5eTFhMmJnSw</guid></item><item><title>新的政府科学项目正在全面绘制人类隐藏的“第六感” - Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/our-body-has-a-hidden-sixth-sense-interoception-that-helps-keep-us-alive/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every human body hums with quiet communication. Beneath every heartbeat, breath, and immune signal lies a hidden conversation between the brain and internal organs. This constant exchange keeps us alive, yet we rarely notice it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are now decoding this “sixth sense,” called interoception, to reveal how our brains stay tuned to the body’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent initiative by experts at the Scripps Research Institute and the &lt;a href="https://alleninstitute.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Allen Institute&lt;/a&gt; aims to chart this mysterious network in detail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project, backed by the National Institutes of Health (&lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;), will create the first-ever neural atlas of interoception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research could ultimately reshape how we understand brain-&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-set-the-record-straight-by-clarifying-common-myths-about-body-language/"&gt;body&lt;/a&gt; communication and open new pathways for treating complex diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-vision-beyond-boundaries"&gt;A vision beyond boundaries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project brings together experts from neuroscience and genetics. The team is led by nobel laureate Dr. Ardem Patapoutian, a professor of neuroscience at the &lt;a href="https://www.scripps.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Scripps Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NIH has committed $14.2 million over five years to make this vision possible. The project represents a rare collaboration that bridges structural, molecular, and functional &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/why-do-women-live-longer-than-men-animals-reveal-the-answer/"&gt;biology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My team is honored that the NIH is supporting the kind of collaborative science needed to study such a complex system,” said Dr. Patapoutian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-the-sixth-sense"&gt;Understanding the sixth sense&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interoception differs greatly from familiar senses such as vision or hearing. While those rely on specialized organs to detect external cues, interoception monitors the body’s internal world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its network of neurons constantly tracks heartbeats, digestion, blood pressure, and immune activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This intricate system operates mostly beyond our awareness. Scientists describe it as the body’s “hidden sixth sense,” responsible for maintaining balance, comfort, and readiness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite its importance, interoception has long remained poorly understood. Signals from deep inside the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/walking-just-once-or-twice-a-week-has-a-major-impact-on-health/"&gt;body&lt;/a&gt; are difficult to record and interpret. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neurons that carry them are scattered across organs, blending into tissues that are hard to isolate. Dr. Patapoutian and his team hope to change that through careful mapping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope our results will help other scientists ask new questions about how internal organs and the nervous system stay in sync,” said Dr. Li Ye, a professor at Scripps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tracing-the-brain-body-links"&gt;Tracing the brain-body links&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research will unfold in two major phases. The first will involve labeling sensory neurons to trace their routes from the spinal cord to internal organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced whole-body imaging will produce high-resolution 3D maps of these neural connections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second phase will use genetic profiling to distinguish neuron types responsible for sending signals from different organs such as the gut, bladder, or fat tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These combined efforts will form the first standardized reference for understanding how internal sensory pathways are structured and function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting neural atlas could serve as a blueprint for the entire field of body-brain research, offering insight into how our nervous system integrates internal &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-found-the-metabolic-ceiling-that-limits-human-endurance/"&gt;signals&lt;/a&gt; to maintain stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-significance-of-the-sixth-sense"&gt;Significance of the sixth sense&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interoception influences almost every vital process in the body. When this communication falters, the results can be severe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have linked disrupted interoceptive signaling to autoimmune disorders, chronic pain, high blood pressure, and even neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mapping how these pathways work, scientists hope to understand why such conditions occur and how they might be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interoception is fundamental to nearly every aspect of health, but it remains a largely unexplored frontier of neuroscience,” said Dr. Xin Jin, associate professor at Scripps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By creating the first atlas of this system, we aim to lay the foundation for better understanding how the brain keeps the body in balance, how that balance can be disrupted in disease and how we might restore it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-listening-to-the-body-s-quiet-signals"&gt;Listening to the body’s quiet signals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The creation of a neural atlas for interoception represents more than an achievement in neuroscience. It is a quest to understand what makes our internal experience possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every sensation – from a fluttering heartbeat to the calm after deep breathing – depends on signals that our brain quietly interprets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By charting this hidden system, scientists hope to transform that silence into understanding. This research will help us tune into the body’s quiet messages and, in doing so, learn how to heal from within.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mapping-the-sixth-sense"&gt;Mapping the sixth sense&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NIH’s Transformative Research Award recognizes projects that dare to cross boundaries and challenge conventions. Established in 2009, this award funds interdisciplinary work with the potential to reshape human health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Scripps and Allen Institute teams, it provides an opportunity to turn a scientific mystery into a measurable map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their work is not only about neurons and organs, but also about uncovering how awareness arises from within. The project could illuminate why emotions, stress, and physical sensations are so deeply intertwined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research may also help develop therapies that restore internal balance in conditions where communication between the brain and body breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-8ccbe339-cbe1-4cd6-a8be-c11242db49b8"&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-8b05bbf5-d035-4b30-9a95-ff1d53f72d45"&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-b12e5732-0b61-49a5-9936-fb4b54f06e7f"&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="block-dcccefa8-a45e-4859-829e-cb01c7743ac3"&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 21:38:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxQTzFwUGFYN2lTbnpqc1k2bHVJOWY2Y1JpX0IyRTVZVmwyM21aTE9wM0pCQU1wblZ3SFhWZ2xkQS1vc0NSM25UcXVrV3pOMF90aEZIc1lzSXgxajVCUkMxc3BfWlFaYnVSai1IbS1MMnI4ZFotNjY2MGNQakNIdWdPWXByRHhjMEhyQ0czSEo3ZzlLbmFEZGhKNldIQWNfQjVGRWc</guid></item><item><title>研究显示， 32%的老年痴呆病例与未经治疗的听力损失有关- KOMO</title><link>https://komonews.com/news/local/october-is-national-protect-your-hearing-month-hearing-loss-and-dementia-linked-in-study-jama</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;October is National Protect Your Hearing Month, and a recent study is linking untreated hearing loss with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An 8-year &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2840522" target="_blank" title="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2840522" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)&lt;/a&gt; found that 32% of dementia cases in adults aged 66 to 90 years could be linked to untreated audiometric hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What this study shows is hearing is about brain health,” Hearing instrument specialist Dennis Tembreull said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study followed nearly 3,000 patients throughout those 8 years and found that dementia cases linked to untreated hearing loss were comparable between mild and moderate or greater hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It gives us definitive proof for patients that we can show them there is a risk, there is a reason to treat your hearing loss,” Tembreull said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only about 20% of patients treat their hearing loss, due to factors like cost, or sometimes not even realizing it is there, Tembreull said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hearing loss is not often seen as the disability it is, but it takes us away from our relationships and from connecting us to the world,” according to Tembreull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tembreull said the best practice is to start having screenings after the age of 50. He said hearing assessments only take 10 or 15 minutes; the assessment is a series of tones across different frequencies to see where your hearing threshold is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even with a mild hearing loss, there is a risk for cognitive impairment,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 21:11:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxNdTFLTkJEMDk3Yy1wTUNxcmVaRllLbWVkUW4yTXYzamZlUUJGaVRFVUJvWG9nSFdHVWV1SFBqdzlXZjhMQk9TSUFMcTJtM3JwcmdwcXJ5cktjNDgzN2tlYWNURXUtcllUc3Z6YWxIWWdnSDg2WFg1NWpGOG5Md1JwVDM1bXpodnFyQ3MyZVE0d1ZZb1ZDcDNMT1pacVQ4cnlOSXJIOTZXN25kM1FPR01xVmNHOVFJYm9EZWRCdlVGMnFoSXc</guid></item><item><title>该州的预期寿命比全国平均水平低四年- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/life-expectancy-in-this-state-is-four-years-lower-than-the-national-average/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life expectancy isn’t just about biology – it reflects the city, state, and country in which you live, the resources around you, and the choices we make as communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., states in the Northeast and West often see longer lives, while several Southern and some Midwestern states lag behind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? People in higher-expectancy states tend to have better access to primary care, cleaner air, safer roads, and more walkable neighborhoods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also show lower rates of smoking and obesity and higher levels of education, which all push life expectancy up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-state-life-expectancy-numbers"&gt;State life expectancy numbers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Carolinians have shorter life expectancy than most Americans in other states. The average &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/global-life-expectancy-is-projected-to-increase-by-5-years-by-2050/"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; in the state sits at 73.5 years, a bottom ten finish based on federal data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States overall reached 77.5 years in 2022, according to a national &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db492.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, which shows a clear gap between South Carolina and the nation. This difference reflects health risks that stack up across years, not just moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new analysis from a digital health group compared states on public resources, food options, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/135-million-people-died-prematurely-due-to-pm25-air-pollution/"&gt;pollution&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, hospital readmissions, and overall longevity. The index used a percent-rank, a simple score that shows where a state stands relative to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South Carolina snapshot shows more unhealthy food outlets than healthy ones, fewer parks and gyms per person, and higher smoking than many states. Those ingredients line up with a shorter average lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mood-and-life-expectancy"&gt;Mood and life expectancy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mind and body do not run on separate tracks. One large &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4461039/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; linked mood and mental disorders to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/people-with-high-resilience-live-up-to-ten-years-longer/"&gt;shorter lives&lt;/a&gt; across dozens of studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers reported that life expectancy dropped by as much as 32 years in people with mental disorders regardless of the state, with a median loss of around 10 years, highlighting the profound toll that mental health can take on overall longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress loads the body with repeated spikes in hormones and inflammation. That biological wear and tear is called allostatic load, the stress cost your body pays to stay in balance over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimistic outlooks are not magic, but they track with healthier sleep, steadier blood pressure, and more consistent care seeking. A depressed mood can do the opposite by draining energy for activity and treatment follow through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-states-shape-life-expectancy"&gt;Why states shape life expectancy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The index counted parks, trails, pools, and gyms because easy access nudges everyday movement. More active time lowers blood pressure and weight, and it improves mental health symptoms that fuel risk cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air quality matters too. Fine particles known as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-air-pollution-impacts-brain-health/"&gt;PM2.5&lt;/a&gt;, tiny soot that reaches deep into lungs, raise risks for heart and lung disease, according to &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;federal&lt;/a&gt; evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food landscapes tilt decisions in quiet ways. If a neighborhood has more fast food than produce, then over time that shows up in cholesterol, blood sugar, and weight, which erode years of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospitals signal system health as well. A higher hospital readmission rate, the share of people who return within 30 days, hints at gaps in follow up care and discharge support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to national tobacco control authorities, cigarette smoking remains the leading preventable cause of disease, death, and disability in the United States, a conclusion supported by decades of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Carolina’s &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/smoking-related-deaths-will-surge-by-2030/"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt; prevalence has improved compared with past decades, but it still hovers above the best performing states. That matters because tobacco accelerates heart disease, stroke, several cancers, and severe lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-index-was-built"&gt;How the index was built&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Healthy States Index that predicts life expectancy used counts of parks, gyms, walking routes, and pools from open mapping data, then adjusted those counts by state population size. It also tallied healthy and unhealthy food outlets to reflect access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pollution scores looked at major air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. These gases are linked to breathing problems and heart disease, which can shorten life when exposure stays high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scoring used a percent-rank system, which ranks each state from lowest to highest across all categories. This approach makes comparisons fair, even between states with very different sizes and populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-can-move-the-needle"&gt;What can move the needle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the personal side, small consistent steps chip away at risk. A daily walk, a steady sleep schedule, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-brain-improves-when-you-quit-smoking-no-matter-your-age/"&gt;smoke free living&lt;/a&gt; push in the right direction when repeated over months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the community side, more safe sidewalks, park upkeep, and transit routes can raise daily activity for entire neighborhoods. Investments in primary care and mental health clinics increase timely treatment, which eases allostatic load by stabilizing stress responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;System fixes help, too. Hospitals and insurers can lower readmissions by scheduling fast follow ups, checking home access to food and medications, and coordinating rides to clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-states-can-boost-life-expectancy"&gt;How states can boost life expectancy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health data can feel distant, but it points to real, everyday choices. Many people underestimate how small environmental or lifestyle changes ripple through a community’s health over decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When cities invest in cleaner air, better grocery access, or smoke-free policies, the results often show up in lower hospital visits and longer lives. These gains may seem gradual, yet they accumulate into years of difference across an entire population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State averages hide large gaps between counties and zip codes. Some South Carolina communities outperform the state, while others face higher burdens from poverty, traffic emissions, and storm damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open mapping and administrative data can miss locations or misclassify a few sites. The index notes that counts may be off slightly, but the broad patterns remain clear enough to guide action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 21:09:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNOXgyUWstMkJoTGw5empHekFWUmU4VkR0R3p1elNYY2NCc1gtRFR0cGpTejRmbnA0bGhEc1RPM25iSzMtU0g4NGNnazZmbGxWTENiMTFmQk1FWEdsaTZkX1ZNOGxuU3Jxd05NSGhyeFFyaTZSM1VYYmJtd3NLTW9TSGl0NTllUXRabkpCcG9vS3NWZVRPM1JacTJyVkF6WHpEWE1QWUdB</guid></item><item><title>“危险”的叮咬日蚊继续在湾区蔓延- SFGATE</title><link>https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/dangerous-invasive-mosquitoes-spread-in-bay-area-21121040.php</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials are urging people to heed caution after an invasive species of “aggressive, day-biting” &lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/invasive-mosquitoes-found-bay-area-21083526.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt; have continued to spread in the Bay Area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spanning no longer than a quarter of an inch and distinguished by the white markings on their legs, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are capable of spreading diseases to people like yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika.

Those who always listened to music showed a 39% lower risk of developing dementia and better memory performance, while those who played instruments had a 35% lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining both activities offered an even greater protective effect against cognitive decline.

While regularly engaging in both music listening and playing was associated with a 33 per cent decreased risk of dementia and 22 per cent decreased risk of cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Ms Jaffa, the findings of the study “suggests music activities may be an accessible strategy for maintaining cognitive health in older adults, though causation cannot be established,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Population ageing has become a global public health concern due to advances in medicine and technology extending human lifespans, and this longer life expectancy has also meant an increase in the prevalence of age‐related diseases, including cognitive decline and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With no cure currently available for dementia, the importance of identifying strategies to help prevent or delay onset of the disease is critical,” senior author Professor Ryan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Evidence suggests that brain ageing is not just based on age and genetics but can be influenced by one’s own environmental and lifestyle choices. Our study suggests that lifestyle-based interventions, such as listening and/or playing music can promote cognitive health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761503085057"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How does music listening affect dementia risk in older adults?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; People over 70 who consistently listen to music have a 39% lower chance of developing dementia compared to those who rarely or never listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761503095412"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Does playing an instrument have similar benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes.

Here, cognitive wellbeing includes maintaining good cognitive function as well as quality of life. Potential effect modification by education was also investigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="gps70163-sec-0002-title"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study used secondary data from the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) study, and the ASPREE Longitudinal Study of Older Persons (ALSOP) sub-study. Included were 10,893 community-dwelling Australian adults who were 70 years and older, without dementia diagnosis at recruitment to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to determine the association between level of music engagement (listening to music, playing an instrument, and a combination of both) and dementia risk from year 3 onwards. Linear mixed models were used to investigate the association with cognitive wellbeing. Analyses adjusted for age, gender and level of education completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="gps70163-sec-0003-title"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always listening to music, compared with never/rarely/sometimes, was associated with a 39% decreased risk of dementia (95% CI = 0.45,0.82, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001), and a 17% decreased risk of CIND (95% CI = 0.74, 0.92, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001). Playing an instrument (often/always) was associated with a 35% decreased dementia risk only (95% CI = 0.42,0.99, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.047). Participants who both listened to and played music had a 33% decreased dementia risk (95% CI = 0.51,0.89, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.006) and a 22% decreased CIND risk (95% CI = 0.65,0.92, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.004).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always listening to music was associated with better global cognition and memory over time (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.004, respectively), but not the other cognitive domains. Engagement in music-related activities was not associated with changes in subjective cognitive wellbeing. In general, findings were stronger in individuals with over 16 years of education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="gps70163-sec-0004-title"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results highlight music as a potential promising, accessible strategy to help reduce cognitive impairment and delay the onset of dementia in later life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 18:47:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE4wc1VzUXlYVGFIVDBCcUwxWkVJS3E5TXBqZmdOY05nWTdkZzdhaElzbnhvZTlEZXNBY2pjVm5iYmtBYU5XajBpZnYxMzEwVUhQdVN3RXhvWFY3U3R5Z2JfdWlpeWlHQUE</guid></item><item><title>镁，神话或奇迹：它能修复您的睡眠，压力和消化吗？ -印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/magnesium-myth-or-miracle-can-it-fix-your-sleep-stress-and-digestion/articleshow/124832057.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the vast scroll-feed of 2025, one mineral has suddenly become a hot topic: magnesium. On TikTok and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/instagram" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; reels, creators with soft lighting and soothing voices whisper about “mag glycinate before bed”, swipe supplements across wellness shelves and tag #magnesium, #sleepaid, #guthealth in posts that rack up hundreds of thousands of views. Welcome to the era of sleep-hacks meeting supplement culture, yet beneath the cinematic glow of pills and promises lies a more complex reality. Can this ubiquitous mineral genuinely reduce insomnia, stress and digestive woes? Or is it another viral health craze dressed in scientific jargon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ancient remedies meet modern magnesium pills&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium’s story is not new. Ancient healers recognised the value of mineral-rich springs – for example the Epsom mineral baths in England (magnesium sulphate) – as remedies for aches, restlessness and sluggish bowels. These traditional practices flagged the mineral’s role long before quantified research existed. Fast-forward to today and the same essential element, involved in hundreds of enzymatic processes in the body, is being repositioned through sleek bottles and influencer tutorials. The mainstreaming of magnesium reflects both a surge in wellness culture and a growing awareness of how modern diet and lifestyle may leave key nutrients behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The social media explosion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scroll through TikTok or Instagram and you will quickly encounter videos of young adults showing off their “night-time routine” – a magnesium glycinate pill, low-lighting, bathroom mirror shot, and the caption: “Slept straight through for the first time in years. Health outlets report that videos with the hashtag #magnesium on TikTok exceed a billion views, and that magnesium-serum or spray routines are trending. While this level of exposure drives consumer interest, several dietitians caution that online posts often oversell the benefits and understate the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What the science actually says&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One notable study, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12412596/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Magnesium Bisglycinate Supplementation in Healthy Adults Reporting Poor Sleep: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial by Schuster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; enrolled 155 adults aged 18-65 with self-reported poor sleep quality.

The effect size was small (Cohen’s d ≈ 0.2) and benefits were stronger in participants who had low magnesium intake at baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35184264/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;A systematic review, The Role of Magnesium in Sleep Health: A Systematic Review of Available Literature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; participants across nine studies and concluded that while magnesium status was associated with sleep quality, randomized clinical trials showed inconsistent results and more long-term research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Take-away: If you are deficient in magnesium, supplementation might help sleep. But for healthy adults with adequate intake, benefits are far from guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Stress and mood&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium is essential to nerve signalling, GABA-receptor activation and regulation of the stress hormone cortisol. A review, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38817505/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Examining the Effects of Supplemental Magnesium on Self-Reported Anxiety and Sleep Quality &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; concluded that supplemental magnesium is “likely useful” for mild anxiety and insomnia, particularly in those with low baseline magnesium status. However the heterogeneity of studies (different formulations, doses, populations) limits firm conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Take-away: Magnesium might support mood and stress when there is a shortfall, but it is not a stand-alone anxiety treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Digestion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here the evidence is stronger but very specific. Magnesium salts such as magnesium oxide and magnesium citrate are employed as osmotic laxatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38817505/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;A randomized controlled study, Magnesium Oxide in Constipation: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that magnesium oxide improved stool frequency and consistency and reduced colonic transit time in patients with mild to moderate constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another cross-sectional study, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34925793/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Association of Dietary Magnesium Intake with Chronic Constipation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that higher dietary magnesium intake was inversely associated with the presence of chronic constipation in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Take-away: For digestive sluggishness or occasional constipation, certain magnesium forms may work – but they are essentially medicinal rather than general wellness picks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much to take, and how&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Diet first:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the National Health Service (NHS) UK guideline, adult men (19–64 years) need around 300 mg magnesium per day, and adult women need around 270 mg. The best way to meet this is through food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium-rich foods include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leafy greens such as spinach, kale and Swiss chard&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts and seeds such as almonds, cashews, peanuts, pumpkin seeds and chia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains including whole-wheat bread, brown rice, oats and quinoa&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legumes such as black beans, lentils and chickpeas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avocados, bananas and dried fruits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dark chocolate (70% cocoa or higher)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatty fish like mackerel and salmon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a handful of pumpkin seeds (28 g) can contain more than 150 mg magnesium, which is over half the recommended daily intake for many adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplement dose: Most trials used around 250–500 mg elemental magnesium per day, often in specific forms. For instance, the Schuster (2025) sleep study used 250 mg daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upper limit: UK guidance advises that more than 400 mg per day from supplements can cause diarrhoea, and there is limited evidence about the safety of consistently high supplemental doses. Some European guidelines recommend not exceeding 250 mg magnesium per day from supplements alone, excluding dietary intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Form matters:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glycinate/bisglycinate – gentle on the stomach, commonly used for sleep and mood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Citrate or hydroxide – stronger bowel effect, suitable for constipation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oxide – lower absorption, often cheaper but more likely to cause loose stools&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Timing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;: Evening dosing is common for sleep support, but consistency is more important than exact timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interactions and caution: Magnesium can interfere with iron, zinc, calcium and certain antibiotics. People with kidney disease or taking laxatives should seek medical advice. Official British guidelines for hypomagnesaemia specify monitoring levels and individualising doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So is magnesium myth or miracle? More nuance than hype. It is a legitimate nutrient whose deficiency can cause problems and whose supplementation may help in specific cases (such as poor sleep when intake is low, or constipation). But it is not a miracle cure for everyone. If your diet is poor, you are stressed, sleep deprived and you are not getting enough magnesium, then a well-chosen supplement might help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you already eat well, sleep fairly, and take care of lifestyle basics, then the benefits will likely be modest. The social media boom around magnesium reflects genuine interest – but science says: check your intake, meet your food first, pick the right form, follow guideline-based dosing, and stay realistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.
