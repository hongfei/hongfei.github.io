But while eligible adults generally should get them, pregnant women should not use them, the WHO stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Limits on global production capacity mean that now only at most about 100 million people could receive the drugs – only 10% of the 1 billion who could benefit. The number of people deemed obese – based on a body mass index of 30 or more – is due to double from 1 billion to 2 billion by 2030, and the costs worldwide to hit $3tn by the same date, it warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It also warned that pharmaceutical companies would have to lower the prices they charge for Mounjaro, Ozempic and similar drugs and hugely expand production of them to avoid people in the world’s poorer countries being denied them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“While medication alone won’t solve this global health crisis, GLP-1 therapies can help millions overcome obesity and reduce its associated harms,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The WHO set out its thinking on the drugs for the first time in a “special communication” aimed at health professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“GLP-1 therapies mark more than a scientific breakthrough. They represent a new chapter in the gradual conceptual shift in how society approaches obesity – from a ‘lifestyle condition’ to a complex, preventable and treatable chronic disease,” its statement in the Journal of the American Medical Association said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“GLP-1 therapies … have emerged as an important innovation in addressing the global obesity challenge. The advent of these medications represents a tipping point in the treatment of obesity, its complications and related co-morbidities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The WHO’s statement was written by three leading doctors: Francesca Celletti, Luz De Regil and Jeremy Farrar, its assistant director for health promotion and disease prevention and control, who was previously its chief scientist and also the director of the Wellcome scientific institute in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It stressed that the drugs on their own were not enough to reverse obesity and that people using them should also eat more healthily, exercise more and have counselling about their lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The WHO accepts the growing evidence that GLP-1s can help reduce the risk of a range of serious and potentially fatal events and conditions including heart attacks and strokes, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, bad cholesterol, sleep apnoea and kidney and arterial disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Three “major barriers” must be overcome to ensure that everyone globally whose health would benefit from GLP-1s can get them: lack of production capacity, availability and affordability; health systems’ preparedness to provide them; and universal access to healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Weight loss drugs have an important role to play, but they are not a silver bullet,” said Katherine Jenner, the executive director of the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/obesity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 50 health, medical and children’s organisations in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In the UK right now, access is still limited, supply is fragile, and NHS use is tightly targeted. These powerful medicines can help individuals with chronic obesity, but they are not suitable for everyone and must be accompanied by comprehensive support to be used safely and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Evidence shows that most people regain weight once they stop taking these drugs, and we cannot medicate two-thirds of the population indefinitely”, added Jenner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 17:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxOUTJrWnRhZEVEMHZuS3lqSkM3eXZaM0h0UC1YUnFXVWQyVWg2NGxuRjV3WGxLeUo5OGhRRTM0cG5abHlGUERpT1pLSG1Va1o5X3laRnhOQ2YzMGwzaTNRZE9vSDlJV3BEVmRuZXA2Y0poelZrNUl2REw1U2hnbDJES29BNnB0ZDdZNjZzR0tFbWZYdVdtdjlCaks4N09GRWtzX1JlVDBqLTNOVUV4QjRPdDBja2lNQQ</guid></item><item><title>疫苗委员会主席辞去新HHS工作-美联社新闻</title><link>https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-martin-kulldorff-vaccines-a1f8135eb1360be0dbf407f3d316ab80</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="LeaderBoardAd-Mobile "&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial vaccine advisory committee will be meeting later this week under a new chairperson, federal officials announced Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Kulldorff is leaving the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to take a leadership role within the Department of Health and Human Services, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kirk Milhoan, who has blamed vaccines for causing cardiovascular disease, will become the new chair. He had been appointed to the committee in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later this week, the committee is scheduled to discuss the pediatric vaccine schedule and hepatitis B shots given to newborns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HHS officials issued a press release praising Kulldorff and his work while leading the panel but did not answer additional questions about the changes. Kulldorff did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;Kennedy has remade the committee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee makes recommendations to the director of the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-director-susan-monarez-50dfbec849b53b4593755d2e6e616687"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors almost always adopted the committee’s recommendations, which were widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist before becoming the nation’s top health official, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-cdc-acip-vaccines-3790c89f45b6314c5c7b686db0e3a8f9"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76"&gt;replaced it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices. He also named Kulldorff as chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Kulldorff’s leadership, the group made several decisions that angered major medical groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a June meeting, the panel recommended that a preservative called &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/thimerosal-mercury-vaccine-preservative-7626ec1455ad98228cf8b041f6388bab"&gt;thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; be removed from doses of flu vaccine even though some members acknowledged there was no proof it was causing harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, the group recommended &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-vaccines-acip-hepatitis-b-chickenpox-21623ff8ead38ae1b21db488ee82a1f8"&gt;new restrictions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on a combination shot that protects against chickenpox as well as measles, mumps and rubella. The panel also took the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-advisers-vaccines-hepatitis-b-covid19-a1fb61ef7e29d93d2828618d890cceb3"&gt;unprecedented step&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of not recommending COVID-19 vaccinations — not even for high-risk populations like seniors — instead making it a matter of personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several doctors’ groups said the changes were not based on good evidence, and advised doctors and patients to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid19-vaccines-aap-cdc-33896013e1d7b3ad06dbd0d99d300bff"&gt;follow guidance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that was previously in place.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Kulldorff is moving to an HHS role &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff’s departure leaves the vaccine committee with 11 members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will now be led by Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who with his wife operates a medical missionary organization called For Hearts and Souls. He appeared at a 2024 congressional hearing at which he said an increase in cardiovascular disease in older teens and young adults should be attributed to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff is a Swedish-born biostatistician who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his time as ACIP chair, the committee abandoned its &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-rfk-gold-standard-science-research-autism-6e4c6bc2534252ab1e7add0942043778"&gt;traditional&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “evidence-to-recommendation” framework, which involved many months of analysis and discussion before proposals came before the full committee for a vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his new role, Kulldorff will become chief science officer within the HHS planning and evaluation office. Officials described the office as the department’s “in-house think tank.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I look forward to contributing to the science-based public health policies that will Make America Healthy Again,” Kulldorff said in the HHS press release.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Committee is expected to vote on hepatitis shots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine committee is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday in Atlanta, with a vote expected on whether to change the recommendation on shots for newborns against hepatitis B, which can cause serious liver infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s unclear exactly what the committee plans to vote on. HHS officials have not responded to repeated questions seeking details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current recommendations call for a first dose to be given to newborns within 24 hours of birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, 15 state governors submitted public comments suggesting the committee was hurting public trust in vaccines and the ability of people to get affordable shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles while injecting drugs. But the virus can also be passed to a baby from an infected mother, and as many as 90% of infected infants go on to have chronic infections that can lead to a lifetime of health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;A hepatitis B vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. in 1981. In 2005, the ACIP recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infant shots are 85% to 95% effective in preventing chronic hepatitis B infections, studies have shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccinations are considered a success, and experts say no recent peer-reviewed research shows any safety problem with giving kids the shots on their first day of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in September, Kennedy’s ACIP members discussed whether to recommend delaying that initial vaccination — something doctors and parents already can choose to do. The panel pulled back from taking a vote amid criticism from independent pediatric and infectious disease specialists who say the vaccine is safe and has helped infant infections drop sharply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third infant death from pertussis &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/pertussis/third-infant-kentucky-dies-whooping-cough-national-cases-stay-high-second-year-row" target="_blank"&gt;In Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; comes as cases are high for the second year in a row.  The national total this year is over 25,000, which is believed to be an undercount.  Many cases go unrecognized or unreported, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bactrim or Septra is associated with a heightened risk &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/antimicrobial-stewardship/common-antibiotic-linked-risk-acute-respiratory-failure-kids-young-adults" target="_blank"&gt;Of acute respiratory failure&lt;/a&gt; in children and teens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts are now warning that the H5N1 bird flu &lt;a href="https://cambodianess.com/article/a-mutating-threat-scientists-warn-h5n1-bird-flu-is-evolving-faster-than-ever" target="_blank"&gt;Is mutating rapidly&lt;/a&gt;, splitting into multiple strains, and infecting mammal species at an unprecedented scale.  This makes preparation for any potential pandemic harder because we don't know what the strain will look like that makes the breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And viable virus has been &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.28.689408v1" target="_blank"&gt;Isolated from soft-bodied ticks feeding on infected gulls.&lt;/a&gt;  It is not yet clear if ticks could be a vector or if this is a dead-end host for the virus.  But ticks are good at spreading lots of other things...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food recalls:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The world is a few steps closer to a cure for HIV, a hopeful sign illuminated by two studies published Monday that feature the work of several Seattle researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The papers, which appear in the journal Nature, present new evidence of long-term, potential treatments for the virus that causes AIDS. The work was published on &lt;a href="https://worldaidsday.org/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;World AIDS Day&lt;/a&gt;, an international event marked every year on the first of December, when people aim to raise awareness of the epidemic, salute ongoing efforts toward a cure and remember lives lost. This year is the first since 1988 the United States will not commemorate the day, per a U.S. State Department directive, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/26/health/trump-us-world-aids-day.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;The New York Times reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies bring together formidable teams of more than 40 scientists, clinicians, pharmacologists, statisticians and others from all over the world who have dedicated much of their careers to HIV research, including two researchers at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and two from the University of Washington. The findings are cause for celebration, said Lillian Cohn, an immunologist and assistant professor at Fred Hutch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the country’s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/health/hiv-lenacapavir-vaccine-trump-cuts-africa.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;fading support&lt;/a&gt; of crucial HIV programs is hard to ignore, said Cohn, who studies how the immune system works to fight the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re in a very paradoxical moment in the world,” she said. “The science is at the best point it’s ever been.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, researchers are watching an “incredible pullback in both leadership positions within the government that support this kind of work and in actual funding,” she said. “For those of us in the field, it honestly feels very dire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09929-5" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;paper Cohn worked&lt;/a&gt; on highlights work toward a new treatment — a combination immunotherapy — that merges three separate, previously studied approaches, and appears to effectively mean long-term remission for people living with HIV without having to take ongoing medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last few decades, scientists have made lifesaving advances around prevention and treatment, including the creation of medication that suppresses HIV to undetectable levels, blocks transmission and prevents the development of AIDS. That medicine, known as antiretroviral therapy, was a turning point for the fight against the virus and is still used today, most commonly as a daily pill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if people living with HIV stop that treatment, most will immediately rebound, Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the goal of this study was to try several back-to-back strategies that could hopefully help the immune system better fight the virus on its own, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead investigators, based at the University of California, San Francisco, “basically threw the kitchen sink at this problem,” Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, researchers gave participants a therapeutic vaccine. Next, they received a compound designed to help wake the sleeping infected cells. Then, they were given a broadly neutralizing antibody, or bnAb, which are powerful antibodies that block many strains of the quickly mutating HIV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then they stopped treatment in these people and watched what happened,” Cohn said. “And what happened was honestly pretty miraculous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that 7 in 10 participants were able to control their virus in a “completely different way,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample size is small, and there are still questions about how widespread this treatment could be, Cohn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it’s a proof-of-principle that it’s possible to do this,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09893-0" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;other paper published Monday&lt;/a&gt; reveals a finding around another rare case of a possible “cure” in a patient from Berlin, said Daniel Reeves, who worked on the study and researches infectious disease and evolutionary biology using mathematical models at Fred Hutch. To date, there are fewer than 10 known instances of long-term remission from HIV without ongoing treatment, Reeves said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study centers on an emerging treatment that involves stem cell transplants from donors with an uncommon genetic mutation — but a version that differs slightly from one scientists had studied in the past. This therapy targets a specific group: people living with HIV who also have cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last 20 years, various transplant methods have played a key role in the search for an HIV cure. The first person in the world reported to be cured of the virus, &lt;a href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/center-news/2020/09/timothy-ray-brown-obit.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;a man originally from Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, underwent a bone marrow transplant in Berlin in 2007 after being diagnosed with leukemia. The procedure involved receiving stem cells from a donor who carried a mutation that provides natural resistance to HIV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mutation, known as delta 32, occurs in about 5% to 10% of northern and some southern Europeans, Reeves said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study offers a notable difference from past transplants. &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;The Seattle man, Timothy Ray Brown — who was initially introduced to the world as the “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/health/timothy-ray-brown-first-patient-cured-of-hiv-dies-at-54.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;Berlin patient&lt;/a&gt;” — received stem cells from someone with a particular type of delta 32, a homozygous version that means there were two copies of the mutation in their genome, Reeves said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this most recent patient, who also underwent care in Berlin, received a transplant from a donor with a heterozygous delta 32, meaning they had just one copy of the mutation, which is about 10 times more common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That opens the door to a bigger donor pool,” Reeves said. “There’s a lot more people that have just one copy of this mutation versus both.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure is very expensive and dangerous, involving full-body radiation and chemotherapy to deplete a person’s cells, which is why it’s not widely accessible to the average person living with HIV, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Fred Hutch researchers noted the process has been attempted many times over the years, following the success of Brown’s case, and few have worked out the same way. There’s still much to be understood about why. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, another Berlin patient appears to have reached long-term remission, with no detectable virus for at least six years, Reeves said. This person is not currently being identified, but is a man who received a stem cell transplant for leukemia in 2015; in late 2018, he stopped taking antiretroviral medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingPostscript" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both papers demonstrate valuable strides, Reeves and Cohn emphasized these treatments are not yet scalable or realistic for all 40 million-plus people living with HIV throughout the world. The work continues, they say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the future of related projects is at risk, largely due to &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/the-trump-administrations-foreign-aid-review-status-of-pepfar/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;freezes on programs like PEPFAR&lt;/a&gt;, or the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, first authorized in 2003 by then-President George W. Bush. PEPFAR is &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/pepfar-latest-global-results-factsheet-dec-2024/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;credited&lt;/a&gt; with having saved 26 million lives and providing HIV treatment for millions of people across 55 countries, according to the State Department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The community is so strong and interconnected now,” Reeves said. “The amount everyone knows is just amazing, and all that feels optimistic and hopeful. So to imagine pulling back from that — the de-prioritization of this work — feels extra painful.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical performance:&lt;/strong&gt; While animal studies have suggested magnesium may impact physical performance—by boosting glucose availability in the brain, muscle, and blood—there’s not enough evidence to show the same benefit in humans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many people don’t get enough magnesium, partly because so much of the food we eat is processed, said &lt;a href="https://www.memphis.edu/healthsciences/about/faculty/marievandermerwe.php" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Marie van der Merwe, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, coordinator of the applied physiology and nutrition doctoral program at the University of Memphis College of Health Sciences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/low-magnesium-11764364" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;low on magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, you may start feeling less than your best. “Having lower magnesium creates a negative feedback loop” in the body, van der Merwe said. "It’s like a domino effect,” she added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium deficiency might be seen in people under a lot of stress, van der Merwe explained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Typically magnesium is inside your cells, but what happens when you’re under stress is the magnesium moves from inside the cell to outside the cell in your bloodstream, and it’s very easy to get excreted through your kidneys,” causing you to be low on magnesium.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When this happens, you may notice symptoms like headache or muscle spasms caused by your magnesium levels. This can make your stress even worse and create a vicious cycle.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Women need 310 to 320 milligrams (mg) of magnesium a day, while men need 400 to 420 mg.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;1 ounce of dry roasted almonds contains 80 mg of magnesium&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup of boiled spinach contains 78 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons of smooth peanut butter contain 49 mg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re experiencing &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/low-magnesium-symptoms-7968593" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;symptoms of low magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, you should try to increase your magnesium through food.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Experts say that &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/best-magnesium-supplements-8579258" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium supplements&lt;/a&gt; shouldn’t be used as a cure-all in place of healthy lifestyle habits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before you try a supplement, you can try to manage your stress level, prioritize sleep and exercise, and reduce intake of alcohol, caffeine, and processed foods, Zumpano said.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you have covered all these bases but are still experiencing concerning [symptoms], that is where supplements can help,” Zumpano added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re dealing with anxiety, high blood pressure, or migraine, a healthcare provider may suggest medication in addition to—or in place of—supplements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “While proper nutrition and a healthy lifestyle are key for preventing a myriad of conditions, you may require medication as a treatment,” Core said. “Supplements can help to improve health, but are not meant to cure any conditions.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, it’s worth talking to a provider before making any changes, no matter how harmless they seem. “Always discuss your concerns with your doctor,” Core said.

This decision comes on the heels of recent federal funding cuts that threaten to disrupt hard-earned progress combatting this global epidemic. Despite significant scientific advancements in HIV treatment and prevention, many people worry about our efforts to end this ongoing crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;World AIDS Day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1988, Dec. 1 has been recognized as World AIDS Day by communities throughout the world. It is a day to remember the people who have died of HIV/AIDS, demonstrate our continued support for people living with HIV and strengthen the global efforts to end this epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. presidents have recognized the day in various ways. Seventeen years ago, &lt;a href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081201.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081201.html" aria-label="President George W. Bush"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081201.html"&gt;President George W. Bush&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; discussed the unparalleled success of his signature initiative, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. He also noted that the red ribbon displayed at the White House was, “a symbol of our resolve to confront HIV/AIDS and to affirm the matchless value of every life.” Just a year ago, &lt;a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/12/01/a-proclamation-on-world-aids-day-2024/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/12/01/a-proclamation-on-world-aids-day-2024/" aria-label="President Joe Biden"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/12/01/a-proclamation-on-world-aids-day-2024/"&gt;President Joe Biden&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; remarked that, “we renew our commitment to accelerating efforts to finally end the HIV/AIDS epidemic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the &lt;a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-179940743" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://substack.com/home/post/p-179940743" aria-label="U.S. State Department"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://substack.com/home/post/p-179940743"&gt;U.S. State Department&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sent an email to employees that stated, “The U.S. Government will not be commemorating World AIDS Day this year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;HIV/AIDS Funding Cuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;One could argue that a day of commemoration does not save lives. But funding does. And the HIV/AIDS funding landscape has changed dramatically during the Trump administration. Winnie Byanyima, executive director of &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/2025-WAD-report_en.pdf?utm_source=UNAIDS+Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=b06b95a07b-2025-world-aids-day-report&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_e7a6256e25-b06b95a07b-114186437" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/2025-WAD-report_en.pdf?utm_source=UNAIDS+Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=b06b95a07b-2025-world-aids-day-report&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_e7a6256e25-b06b95a07b-114186437" aria-label="UNAIDS"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/2025-WAD-report_en.pdf?utm_source=UNAIDS+Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=b06b95a07b-2025-world-aids-day-report&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_e7a6256e25-b06b95a07b-114186437"&gt;UNAIDS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, noted in a recently released report that, “this year’s disruption to the global response has exposed the fragility of the progress we have fought so hard to achieve.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The numbers are stark. According to the UNAIDS report, 60% of women-led HIV organizations have been significantly affected by recent funding disruptions. The number of people accessing pre-exposure prophylaxis has dropped in many countries. NGOs in the U.S. and globally have scaled back their services because of a loss of funding. The result? The number of new HIV infections per year could rise after &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet" aria-label="several years of declines"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet"&gt;several years of declines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;Current HIV/AIDS Landscape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Today, about 40 million people worldwide are living with HIV. Roughly 1.3 million people became newly infected in 2024 and over 600,000 people died. In the United States, about 1.2 million people are living with HIV. And roughly 32,000 people become newly infected each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Globally and domestically, the number of new infections per year has dropped in recent years. In the U.S., for example, the number of new infections declined 12% between 2018 and 2022. Recent advancements in HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention certainly have contributed to these declines. The long-acting injectable lenacapavir, for example, is a highly effective pre-exposure prophylaxis drug. Just two injections per year can provide nearly complete protection from the sexual transmission of HIV. For people infected with HIV, various drug regimens can effectively reduce one’s viral load to undetectable levels. And we know that U = U. If your viral load is undetectable, then you cannot transmit the virus sexually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MWrh7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;But the gains that we have made in recent years easily can be lost. Stigma, discrimination, and inequalities prevent people from accessing services. Decreased funding will negatively impact the availability of HIV/AIDS services. Now is not the time to relax our efforts to ending the HIV epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;World AIDS Day may not directly save lives. But it is an opportunity for us to remember the gravity of the problem. As &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pInv-c2Ub8U" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pInv-c2Ub8U" aria-label="Beatriz Grinsztejn"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pInv-c2Ub8U"&gt;Beatriz Grinsztejn&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, president of the International AIDS Society, recently remarked, “On this World AIDS Day, let us honor the strength of communities, the power of science and the courage of everyone working with, living with or affected by HIV.” On this World AIDS Day, the U.S. declines to participate. Let’s hope this decision does not contribute to a resurgence of HIV/AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Forbes</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 13:46:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOeUtYSDVpbEZ1alFiVk04NzhBNmlMZ0ZUdEo5eG84MHgwcE5McnQ2ckRNeTFodzRaQ2ZuRk9rOFotV09hOTdoTDdhSVlWdlhsUHhBZGNuY0Y3UHFtcmNMN3BnX3QxVDlERXg5ZWVhQmlRTFJPM0ZvUGtHaXdzTEUtclA4ak9rYUkwT1BjeWluSTkzNkw2Y3JLYjRiQTdIUWl0Z2lUS1FwcjNUZw</guid></item><item><title>世卫组织推荐GLP-1药物治疗肥胖症- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/recommends-glp-1-drugs-obesity-rcna245919</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1adfc5" class="body-graf"&gt;The World Health Organization on Monday recommended GLP-1 drugs as a tool to manage obesity in adults, marking a shift in the way the U.N. agency has historically framed obesity treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d70f12" class="body-graf"&gt;The WHO said that GLP-1 drugs can be part of a long-term treatment strategy that combines medication with counseling on healthy diets and physical activity.

In the U.S., &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/poll-1-in-8-adults-say-they-are-currently-taking-a-glp-1-drug-for-weight-loss-diabetes-or-another-condition-even-as-half-say-the-drugs-are-difficult-to-afford/" target="_blank"&gt;1 in 8 adults report&lt;/a&gt; that they’re currently taking a a GLP-1 drug for weight loss or another condition like diabetes, according to KFF, a nonprofit health think tank. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8abea1" class="body-graf"&gt;WHO in September added GLP-1 drugs as a diabetes treatment to its list of essential medicines, but stopped short of adding them for obesity alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd9cb7" class="body-graf"&gt;The organization's new guidelines — crafted by a committee of obesity, pharmacology and public health experts — came at the request of WHO member states, the officials said. They follow the approval of GLP-1 drugs by several regulatory authorities, including the Food and Drug Administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d5a706" class="body-graf"&gt;Many countries factor WHO guidelines into their health policies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-85ccdc" class="body-graf"&gt;The agency's recommendation is conditional, meaning the benefits likely outweigh the downsides but more evidence is needed.

It was a death sentence then but now you can live long and well with HIV so that it doesn’t develop into Aids. With treatment, your viral load can be undetectable so you can’t pass it on to another person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“If you continue to take medication, you will not transmit because it wont be detected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“There shouldn’t be any fear attached to having a diagnosis in this day and age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Annabel Overton, a midwife, added: “It’s important that people know that because that could be part of the barrier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Speaking to the rise of false information online, Ms Moore said: “I want people to rise above the misinformation and seek advice from reputable sources such as ourselves. Don’t use social media to get your information because a lot of that is personal opinion rather than evidence-based research. That will hinder the progress towards 2030 and beyond where we might see the elimination of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“Fear is driving a lot of the stigma. Because HIV is lifestyle linked, people may misconstrue how you caught HIV. You don’t have to be promiscuous to catch it, it can be the one and only time that you have sex that you pick that up. We are all at risk of getting HIV if we indulge in sex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;She said that within the island’s small population, fears persist about lack of confidentiality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“People don’t need to worry about confidentiality when they come here. Information is kept safe and secure,” Ms Overton insisted. “What comes into these four walls, stays in these four walls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Moore said it was also important to raise awareness of treatment and support services including the Sexual Reproductive Health at the Department of Health where she works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;She said: “We have free services that include healthcare, emotional support and access to life-saving treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“We have in-house social workers, we work closely with the infection specialist as well as the Mid Atlantic Wellness Institute.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Overton said: “Testing is free at the clinic whether you are insured, uninsured or underinsured.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Moore added: “Treatment is funded so that you will be able to get your medication at very little cost to you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;HIV is spread from the body fluids of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids, and from a mother to her baby. It can be prevented and treated with antiretroviral therapy where as untreated HIV can progress to Aids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Moore said Bermuda was fortunate to have eliminated mother-to-child transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Overton explained: “We screen very regularly during pregnancy, at the beginning, in the middle and towards the end as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Moore added: “So if it is detected, the mother can be treated and it can prevent that transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Moore and Ms Overton said that the facility it is working with LGBTQ+ support and advocacy charity &lt;a href="https://outbermuda.org/" id="link-1d25ee535fe0066dd9ee8e1912bceca4" target="_blank"&gt;OutBermuda&lt;/a&gt; as well as with HIV/Aids charity &lt;a href="https://helpingservices.bm/listing/star-supportive-therapy-for-persons-with-aids-and-their-families/" id="link-5082f6c99308f791532fb5c6f75da4dc" target="_blank"&gt;Star&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“We work through schools, health fairs, pop-ups events, Sexual Health Awareness Week and other events throughout the year to ensure everyone has the information they need,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-factbox desktop hidden"&gt;&lt;p class="title"&gt;Health awareness events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="text"&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-00d89de499c3b7452add720ba9ca8c2a"&gt;December 1:&lt;/strong&gt; World Aids Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-12d9f5a7fe9944d7a8c05c15276168cd"&gt;Mid-February:&lt;/strong&gt; Sexual Health Awareness Week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-36a1cf30f9749117646d9b028c9092ea"&gt;April 7:&lt;/strong&gt; World Health Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-a44eb03af3ca1302e27828cb82b4b959"&gt;June:&lt;/strong&gt; HIV Pop-Up Testing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-factbox-mobile d-lg-none"&gt;&lt;p class="title"&gt;Health awareness events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="text"&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-00d89de499c3b7452add720ba9ca8c2a"&gt;December 1:&lt;/strong&gt; World Aids Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-12d9f5a7fe9944d7a8c05c15276168cd"&gt;Mid-February:&lt;/strong&gt; Sexual Health Awareness Week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-36a1cf30f9749117646d9b028c9092ea"&gt;April 7:&lt;/strong&gt; World Health Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-a44eb03af3ca1302e27828cb82b4b959"&gt;June:&lt;/strong&gt; HIV Pop-Up Testing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;A report published at the end of 2022 contains information received by the Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit from 1982 through to January 31, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;It showed that as of December 31, 2022, it was estimated that there were 295 persons known to be living with HIV in Bermuda, giving an overall prevalence of 0.5 per cent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-factbox desktop hidden"&gt;&lt;p class="title"&gt;Report’s findings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="text"&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Since 1982, HIV has been diagnosed in 792 persons in Bermuda.

			&lt;p&gt;A recent study points to a key bone-strengthening mechanism at work in the body, which could be targeted to treat the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoporosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351968"&gt;bone-weakening disease, osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by researchers from the University of Leipzig in Germany and Shandong University in China, the study identified the cell receptor GPR133 (also known as ADGRD1) as being crucial to bone density, via bone-building cells &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoblast"&gt;called osteoblasts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variations in the &lt;em&gt;GPR133&lt;/em&gt; gene had previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108145"&gt;been linked&lt;/a&gt; to bone density, leading scientists to turn their attention to the protein it encoded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-found-deep-inside-human-bones-scientists-warn"&gt;Microplastics Found Deep Inside Human Bones, Scientists Warn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team ran tests on mice in which the gene was either absent or could be activated using a chemical called AP503.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the absence of the &lt;em&gt;GPR133&lt;/em&gt; gene, the mice grew up with weak bones, resembling the symptoms &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/osteoporosis-is-a-silent-killer-heres-how-to-avoid-it"&gt;of osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;. However, when the receptor was present and activated by AP503, bone production and strength improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Using the substance AP503, which was only recently identified via a computer-assisted screen as a stimulator of GPR133, we were able to significantly increase bone strength in both healthy and osteoporotic mice," &lt;a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/newsdetail/artikel/research-for-stronger-bones-and-muscles-in-old-age-2025-07-03"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; University of Leipzig biochemist Ines Liebscher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these experiments, AP503 serves as a biological button that gets the osteoblasts working harder. The researchers were also able to show that it could work in tandem &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-can-provide-relief-for-backpain-if-you-do-it-safely"&gt;with exercise&lt;/a&gt; to strengthen bones even further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that the GPR133 cell receptor is a crucial link in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/green-spaces-may-have-a-powerful-effect-on-the-bones-of-children"&gt;keeping mice bones strong&lt;/a&gt; is an important finding. While the results are based on an animal model, the underlying processes are likely similar in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If this receptor is impaired by genetic changes, mice show signs of loss of bone density at an early age – similar to osteoporosis in humans," &lt;a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/newsdetail/artikel/research-for-stronger-bones-and-muscles-in-old-age-2025-07-03"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Liebscher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174316" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174316" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram.jpg" alt="Bone diagram" class="wp-image-174316 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram-633x415.jpg 633w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram-600x393.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174316" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;With GPR133 activated (on the left), the osteoblasts (orange) are more dominant.

While available treatments can &lt;a href="https://theros.org.uk/information-and-support/osteoporosis/treatment/"&gt;slow the condition's progress&lt;/a&gt;, there's no way to reverse or cure the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current treatments also tend to come with risky side effects (like an increased risk of other diseases) or become less effective over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are actually &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-a-new-hormone-that-makes-super-strong-bones"&gt;numerous factors&lt;/a&gt; that have an influence on bone strength, and that gives scientists plenty of scope for finding methods &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-bones-could-soon-heal-a-whole-lot-better-thanks-to-polymer-nanoshells"&gt;that ward off&lt;/a&gt; issues like osteoporosis and promote a healthier old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/living-material-made-from-blood-can-repair-bones-study-shows"&gt;In 2024, scientists developed a blood-based implant&lt;/a&gt; that supercharges this mechanism for bigger repair projects: broken bones. When skin tissue is wounded, our blood &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-synthetic-blood-clotting-system-could-help-stop-internal-bleeding"&gt;starts clotting&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/how-wounds-hea"&gt;the healing process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international team of researchers behind the implant called it a "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202407156"&gt;biocooperative regenerative&lt;/a&gt;" material: it uses synthetic peptides to improve the structure and function of the barrier naturally formed by blood when it clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tests on rats, the gel-like substance – which can be 3D-printed – was effective in repairing bone damage.

In the United States, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;one person dies every 34 seconds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; due to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), according to the CDC. The global burden is rising, and CVDs resulted in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;19.8 million deaths globally&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in 2022, as per the WHO. Placing heart health should be the topmost priority today. In a newsletter, Dr Jeremy London, a board-certified cardiovascular surgeon trained at the Joseph Hospital in Denver and Carolinas Medical Center, NC, talks about the common traits found in heart surgery patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Common traits found in heart surgery patients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The surgeon, who has over 25 years of clinical experience, revealed that these common traits are often the driving force behind heart diseases in those who require heart surgery. He also explained why focusing on the modifiable factors is important. “The harsh truth is that surgery resolves the acute problem but does not address the underlying chronic problem. Behaviour modifications are the most effective treatment of the why or the root cause,” the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Silent Heart Attack Symptoms Women Often Miss | Spot the Warning Before It’s Too Late | Dr Rajeev Agrawal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; What are these traits? Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Smoking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smoking is the worst thing to do to your body, especially the heart, according to Dr London. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Smoking damages the lining of your blood vessels, which has been directly shown to lead to atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in your arteries). This hardens and narrows your blood vessels, restricting blood flow to your heart and other organs,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; “In addition, the carbon monoxide from cigarette smoke binds to haemoglobin in the blood more readily than oxygen, reducing the amount of oxygen that reaches the heart and the rest of your body.” You don't have to be a chain-smoker to damage your heart. Even occasional smoking can lead to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; A recent study published in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease found that &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004561" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;even low-intensity smokers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have a substantially higher risk of heart disease and death compared to people who never smoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The good news is the solution is simple: stop smoking,” the doctor advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Obesity&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second trait that most heart surgery patients share is obesity. “I have seen the rise of obesity firsthand. With fast food and processed foods increasing in popularity, obesity has become the silent killer,” the doctor said. He explained how obesity leads to high blood pressure and chronic inflammation that damages the blood vessels, resulting in atherosclerosis and elevating heart disease risk. A 2024 study by the American Heart Association found that &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/obesity-related-heart-disease-deaths-increased-in-the-u-s-over-the-past-two-decades?preview=cd9c&amp;amp;preview_mode=True" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;obesity-related heart disease deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; increased by 180% in the US between 1999 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diabetes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr London noted that type 2 diabetes could also lead to severe heart disease that requires surgery. “Type 2 diabetes is a lifestyle-induced disease. That means it will take lifestyle changes to reverse it,” he said. Simple changes such as weight loss, eating a healthy diet and physical activity can reverse the condition. Another study by the American Heart Association in 2023 found that one in three adults with type 2 diabetes may have &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/1-in-3-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-may-have-undetected-cardiovascular-disease?preview=cd9c&amp;amp;preview_mode=True" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;undetected cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Genetics&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fourth factor that increases the risk of heart disease is your genetics. “You can't run from your genes. However, you do have power over how they are expressed,” the cardiologist said. Yes, you read that right. You can still control how your genes express by making three simple changes in your lifestyle: diet, exercise and stress management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The key is not to eat healthily once, go to the gym once or get a good night's rest once. Those are small victories. The key is to build a routine where, if you miss those things, you crave them,” the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; If these are some of the traits you observe in your life, this is your sign to make changes. Just as Dr London emphasised, focus on the lifestyle factors you can improve to keep your heart healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

			&lt;p&gt;The bumpy trajectory of human aging may have a tipping point as we enter our twilight years, a new study has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past the age of around 75, our bodies can no longer easily recover from injury or illness – a sharp decline in resilience that comes with a corresponding rise in the risk of dying, according to researchers at Dalhousie University in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their model looks at aging as a balance between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dying-cells-play-a-vital-unexpected-role-in-healing-study-shows"&gt;damage and repair&lt;/a&gt;, with the breakdown of that balance marking the point of no return into frailty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding could help researchers and clinicians &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/standing-on-one-leg-can-reveal-a-huge-amount-about-your-health"&gt;better understand&lt;/a&gt; and plan for people's health care needs as they approach this tipping point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-the-surprising-age-at-which-your-brain-reaches-its-peak"&gt;Study Reveals The Surprising Age at Which Your Brain Reaches Its Peak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We find that natural aging dynamics are non-trivial and include a tipping point near age 75 where robustness and resilience become insufficient and after which individuals tend towards worse health over time, marking an end to a robust and resilient youthful period," writes a team led by physicist Glen Pridham of Dalhousie University, in a preprint available on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.07795"&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As several recent studies have revealed, the course of human aging isn't as smooth as you might think. Rather, the human body appears to undergo periods of accelerated aging while we're alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a recent study into the molecular changes associated with aging, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/human-aging-two-sharp-peaks"&gt;humans experience two drastic lurches forward&lt;/a&gt;, one at the average age of 44, and the other at the average age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, research also suggests there's at least one turning point during life when organ aging accelerates. A study published this year found &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-turning-point-when-your-bodys-aging-accelerates"&gt;this turning point occurs at age 50&lt;/a&gt;, after which your tissues and organs age more rapidly than the decades preceding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we enter our twilight years, there's no denying that health problems &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/shockingly-common-injury-linked-with-increased-risk-of-dementia"&gt;become more serious&lt;/a&gt;, both in their frequency and severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This increased vulnerability and susceptibility to health setbacks is clinically referred to as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cger.2010.08.009"&gt;frailty&lt;/a&gt;, and doctors often use a tool called the &lt;a href="https://www.health.vic.gov.au/older-people-in-hospital/frailty/identifying-frailty"&gt;Frailty Index&lt;/a&gt;, based on the number of health deficits a patient has, to predict that patient's health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181856" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181856" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TrajectoriesOfHealthAndFunctionalDeclineWithAging.jpg" alt="Graph showing trajectories of normal and accelerated aging where people become increasingly frail." class="wp-image-181856 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TrajectoriesOfHealthAndFunctionalDeclineWithAging.jpg 612w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TrajectoriesOfHealthAndFunctionalDeclineWithAging-600x453.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181856" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Research is revealing that &lt;span&gt;aging isn't a steady process, as depicted here, but one with accelerations and tipping points. &lt;/span&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302593532_Cardiac_Senescence_Heart_Failure_and_Frailty_A_Triangle_in_Elderly_People"&gt;Shinmura, &lt;em&gt;The Keio Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, 2016&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pridham and his colleagues used the Frailty Index in a different way: to construct a new mathematical model of human aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, they needed a robust dataset. They used data from the University of Michigan &lt;a href="https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/about"&gt;Health and Retirement Study&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.elsa-project.ac.uk/"&gt;English Longitudinal Study of Ageing&lt;/a&gt;, which have tracked the health of thousands of people over many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-turning-point-when-your-bodys-aging-accelerates"&gt;Scientists Reveal Turning Point When Your Body's Aging Accelerates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From those surveys, the researchers included data on 12,920 individuals who visited medical facilities 65,261 times between them, with a median age of 67.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They quantified each participant's health using a Frailty Index comprising more than 30 attributes, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-key-way-to-slow-chronic-illness-in-old-age"&gt;chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt;, difficulties performing tasks and activities, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-heart-is-vulnerable-these-4-things-will-help-you-protect-it"&gt;cardiovascular conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, they built a mathematical model to analyze changes over time in two key health areas: adverse health events, such as illness or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-biomaterial-could-finally-repair-damaged-cartilage-in-injured-joints"&gt;injury&lt;/a&gt;, and the time it takes for participants to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-in-hospital-appears-to-speed-up-patient-recovery"&gt;recover from them&lt;/a&gt;, using the Frailty Index as a measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Frailty Index rose, it meant the participant was experiencing more health setbacks and recovering from them less effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadly, they found that both health setbacks and recovery time increased with age, until the participant reached a tipping point at which the recovery rate could no longer keep up with the rate of health setbacks. The age range for this tipping point was about 73 to 76 years for both men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beyond this tipping point, the ongoing loss of both robustness and resilience leads to a sharp increase in the Frailty Index and a commensurate increase in risk of mortality," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.07795"&gt;the researchers write in their preprint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We infer that robustness and resilience mitigate environmental stressors only up to an age of 75, beyond which health deficits will increasingly accumulate, leading to death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not exactly cheery, but the good news is that this information could help soften or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/people-who-live-to-100-have-a-unique-relationship-with-disease"&gt;mitigate the effects&lt;/a&gt; of this tipping point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181858" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181858" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TipsOnHowToPreventFallsNIHInfographic.jpg" alt="Illustration of a grey-haired man with walking stick standing in front of a bed with a window to the right." class="wp-image-181858 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TipsOnHowToPreventFallsNIHInfographic.jpg 612w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TipsOnHowToPreventFallsNIHInfographic-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181858" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Falls can lead to sharp declines in overall health, but they are preventable.

These differences were not driven by repetitive responding that is typical of autism. The paper was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251385029"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Autism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by differences in social communication, sensory processing, and patterns of behavior that may include strong interests and a preference for routine. Autistic individuals tend to experience the world with heightened or reduced sensitivity to sensory input, which can influence how they interact with their environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The social behaviors of many autistic individuals differ from typical norms, but these differences often reflect communication styles rather than a lack of social motivation. Research shows that autistic individuals can display strong prosocial behaviors, such as helping, sharing, and comforting, especially when situations are clear and expectations are explicit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to non-autistic individuals, autistic people tend to rely more on rules, fairness principles, or empathy based on understanding others’ situations rather than on reading subtle emotional cues. When tasks are structured and communication is direct, autistic individuals often show prosocial responses equal to or greater than their non-autistic peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Paul AG Forbes and his colleagues note that previous studies suggest that autistic individuals show a flatter decline in generosity towards socially distant others compared with non-autistic individuals. In other words, non-autistic individuals tend to be the most generous with the people closest to them, but their generosity decreases relatively quickly when more distant individuals (those they do not know well or at all) are considered. This decline in generosity is present in autistic individuals as well, but it is much slower and less steep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of this study wanted to know whether this less pronounced decline in generosity with social distance is a consequence of autistic individuals’ preference for repetitive responding (whereby they might respond in the same way regardless of how close the person is to them) or is caused by genuinely higher prosociality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants were 37 autistic and 38 non-autistic adults. They were recruited via a local database of participants at University College London. 36 of them were women. The average age of autistic individuals was 34, and it was 39 for the non-autistic group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants first completed the six primary items of the Social Value Orientation (SVO) questionnaire. In these six items, they needed to allocate money to themselves and another person. The items offered various combinations of amounts allocated to the participant and to another individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each item, combinations of amounts given to oneself and to the other are presented differently on a slider; therefore, choosing the same relative position on the slider in different items results in different distributions of money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants completed this six times with instructions each time to imagine an individual with a specific social distance from them, ranging from people very close to them, to people they barely know, to people who are complete strangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For very close others, participants were told not to think of anyone with whom they share a household or a bank account (as giving money to those people might be like giving money to oneself), nor anyone they have negative feelings toward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure the results reflected genuine behavior, the decisions were incentivized: participants were informed that a computer would randomly select choices to be paid out in real money. At the end of the study procedure, participants completed an assessment of attitudes towards money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that as the social distance increased, the generosity of non-autistic participants decreased faster than the generosity of autistic participants. In other words, autistic participants were more generous towards strangers and people they barely knew than non-autistic individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis showed that these differences were not caused by repetitive behavior (i.e., autistic people’s preference to give the same answer every time). There were also no differences between the two groups in their attitudes toward money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Autistic individuals showed enhanced prosocial behavior, replicating previous work. Compared with non-autistic participants, autistic adults were more generous towards people they felt less close to. We extend previous work by showing that these effects were not due to more repetitive responding in autism nor due to differences in attitudes towards money. Our findings support an emerging view that while autistic people often face challenges navigating their social worlds, autism is associated with more prosocial behavior,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study contributes to the scientific understanding of autism. However, it should be noted that the study was conducted on a relatively small group of participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251385029"&gt;Increased prosocial value orientation in autistic adults,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Paul AG Forbes, Gillian Hughes, Leonhard Schilbach, Sarah White, and Tobias Kalenscher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 11:03:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNS1c4aWp2c0lkYUd6ZDM3S0NOeXdMeWNPb2RVbGtYOHJ1R2xIVTd4WlRycDFnSFZNYUtMTnNlMjVPbm9jMkwzNEZRc1BvZUlZd3Y4ZmhMYjU4TVlaVjBkZzdSRzB6WFc5cGxRS2pkMGVodHduRzZFcW1tX1o5cXlwY1h1dWo3dHM5WFNRNU43bjJCd2p1YVl3OVlUTm1MWWstNVQ3bnhqRHlBQUIwTVlN</guid></item><item><title>科学家说，人类大脑在整个生命周期中有5个“时代” - NewsNation</title><link>https://www.newsnationnow.com/science/human-brains-eras-lifespans/</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Fully funding the program, the council says, could save up to $100 billion in health care costs by 2030. But members say House proposals would eliminate funding for domestic and global HIV efforts, cut more than $1 billion from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and remove key parts of the Ryan White Program, which supports people living with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In a statement, White House spokesman Kush Desai said, “PACHA is a largely symbolic body whose members are engaging in another useless PR exercise that has no connection to the Trump administration’s robust work to tackle HIV and AIDS.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“HHS is strengthening efforts to end the HIV epidemic by advancing next-generation HIV prevention and treatment options, strengthening viral suppression nationwide via HRSA’s Ryan White program, supporting emergency preparedness, and expanding access to trusted HIV information,” Desai added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For Treston, who has treated patients since 1986, the prospect of losing momentum feels painfully familiar, despite modern preventive tools that didn’t exist in those early years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Another PACHA member, Tori Cooper, said the stakes are not abstract but matters of life and death for the communities she serves. A longtime HIV advocate, she works as director of community engagement for the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Transgender Justice Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“We know that when people have HIV and it goes untreated, they die, and often they die horrible, painful deaths,” Cooper said. “And I'm not just talking about people who do ‘dirty things’ or ‘nasty things.’ I'm talking about people who perhaps were born living with HIV, or people who got it and didn't even know that they had it, or didn't know that their partners had it, folks who have been in monogamous relationships for years, it's all kinds of folks,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Cooper said she fears a rise in preventable illness if people cannot reach clinics or afford care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Because people aren't able to get tested to confirm an HIV diagnosis, that means they're not getting the care that they need to get to an undetectable viral load,” she said. “If they have detectable viral loads, then it makes it easier to pass HIV along to their sexual partners or during childbirth or through accidents or injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Philip Chan, an HIV physician in Rhode Island who drafted the first version of the letter, echoed those concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“HIV is not a partisan issue,” Chan said. “HIV, similar to many other infectious diseases, does not discriminate based on, sex, religion, political party, it is important that we keep up our efforts to address this otherwise, more people will continue to be infected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Chan noted that Ending the HIV Epidemic began under the Trump administration with the goal of ending new HIV infections by 75% by 2025 and 90% by 2030. He said progress could be lost without continued investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For Treston, the quilt remains a reminder of the lives her generation lost, but she believes the country still has an opportunity to avoid repeating the past. She points to the bipartisan legacy of HIV policy, from early federal HIV bills to PEPFAR to the Ryan White Program, as proof that the United States can protect its progress if it chooses to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;“We have the tools to stop new HIV infections and keep people who are already positive healthy,” she said. “We can end the HIV epidemic, but only if we continue the federal support that made these gains possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 10:18:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNN1ZsOHFTY2ItQ3h1R1ZYbU1DaEZFeEVzSEFSUlcxMlZLaFlfVDV5RFhETHFrYWdHV1luSkh5VmpxeU1zeDcwb1JZX0UyaHV6ekpVOV85aWhnSXFoVXliMXhJNDhwRXhXVU9XbE83S283ZkZZMkR3VlJDbElpLTBSdUpGWWZ1dmxyRjc4WVl3NkRoOEFON3RtbTViU2k5emZldjVZLTJMWW5ScFFfTkE1VtIBtgFBVV95cUxPRlFlcWx4dzI0WDlUc0VKUGE2TGpaVzdlQVFwTlF0WnB3NW9Bejhjc3REdUxwMTF1RnBvekxuZnAtTlZtdkR1bGwySDNfYVNCSDdVMnNOcTBSVDdCV1hETWlVWmw1Y0NHUXFGTEluMVFuZE5HMGxoemFMNDAtRFJmNUhKUjcxVXZxeFN6VHF3MHFEak5DaE45WnBQYTJpQ29hVl9mZjhWSVBCbUV5eEdWZC1Nd3FBZw</guid></item><item><title>为什么唱歌对你的健康有惊人的好处- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20251128-how-singing-can-improve-your-health</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-85f9acf9-0 kfxpiP"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Singing also activates a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/hbm.21173" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;broad network of neurons on both sides of our brain&lt;/a&gt;, causing regions that deal with language, movement and emotion to light up.

Some anthropologists &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-017-9607-x" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;believe&lt;/a&gt; that our hominid ancestors sang before they could speak, using vocalisations to mimic the sounds of nature or express feelings. This may have played a key role in the development of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.150221" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;complex social dynamics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2153599X.2023.2197977" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;emotional expression and ritual&lt;/a&gt;, and Street points out that it's no accident that singing is part of every human's life, whether musically inclined or not, noting that our brains and bodies are attuned from birth to respond in positive ways to song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Lullabies are sung to children, and then songs are sung at funerals," he says. "We learn our times tables through chanting, and our ABCs through the rhythmic and melodic structure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;&lt;span id="come-together" class="sc-d16436d-0 gCPVhV"&gt;&lt;b id="come-together" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Come together&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But not all types of singing are equally beneficial.

   &lt;p&gt;Prediabetes is common in the U.S. — around 1 in 3 people have it. And many people may not know they have it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For prediabetic people, their glucose levels are higher than people without diabetes – but not quite in the diabetic range.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You may see higher glucose rises after certain meals," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://medicine.ucsf.edu/people/sarah-kim" target="_blank"&gt;Sarah Kim&lt;/a&gt; is a diabetologist and professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco. "And you might see it go up after you eat a cherry pie…. You may see bigger changes in your glucose, whether you're sedentary versus active."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The FDA approved the first over-the-counter &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-over-counter-continuous-glucose-monitor" target="_blank"&gt;continuous glucose monito&lt;u&gt;r&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year. Since then, more people who are prediabetic or without a diabetes diagnosis have started checking in on their blood glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Kim says while these devices may not offer much insight for people without diabetes, they can be empowering for those looking to make lifestyle changes or better understand their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interested in more science of the human body?

They include men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, sex workers, transgender people, and prison inmates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In each case, offering services specifically designed around those groups’ needs has borne fruit – for example, LGBTQ+ friendly walk-in clinics can mean access to care for people who are stay away from public clinics due to the stigma around HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many of those clinics and other outreach services have closed, along with swathes of community-led organisations, previously reliant on donor funding. One member of the LGBTQ+ community in Uganda, quoted in the Frontline Aids country report, said the loss of safe spaces had left them “isolated and exposed […] the mental strain is overwhelming”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c1de7999-c66f-4654-9501-2d20cb1fc0db" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;An HIV clinic in Kampala.

Those first few hours influence our cells, metabolism, immune strength and long-term disease resistance. When practiced consistently, simple daily actions can reduce inflammation, improve repair mechanisms and support the body’s defence systems. Cancer risk builds gradually over the years, which means prevention depends on repeated choices rather than extreme changes. Morning habits that improve physical health are among the most effective because they align with natural body rhythms and support processes that protect cellular stability. A thoughtful morning routine can therefore contribute to reduced cancer risk and a stronger foundation for lifelong wellness and vitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A peer-reviewed research review published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6527123/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; reported that regular physical activity is strongly linked with reduced risk and improved survival outcomes for several major cancers, including breast and colon cancer. The review concluded that even moderate activity, such as brisk walking, contributes meaningful protective benefits when compared with sedentary lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Morning habits to &lt;keyword id="25304948" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="reduce-cancer-risk" source="keywords"&gt;reduce cancer risk&lt;/keyword&gt; for &lt;keyword id="22312981" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="long-term-health" source="keywords"&gt;long-term health&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Move your body&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning the day with physical movement activates metabolism and improves circulation, sending oxygen and nutrients to cells that need repair. Even 20 to 30 minutes of walking, stretching or yoga reduces inflammation and supports the immune system’s ability to remove damaged or abnormal cells. Morning exercise also stabilises hormones and supports a healthy weight, which is important because excess body fat increases the risk of several types of cancer. The goal is consistency rather than intensity. When movement becomes a daily ritual, the body stays stronger, more resilient and better able to protect itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Plant-forward breakfast&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nutritious breakfast gives the body antioxidants, fibre and vitamins that protect cells from damage. Whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, oats and whole grains help reduce chronic inflammation and support digestive health. A breakfast rich in fibre supports a healthy gut microbiome, which plays an essential role in immunity and cancer prevention. Choosing plant-based and minimally processed foods also reduces exposure to additives and compounds found in highly processed meals. A bowl of oats with berries or wholegrain toast with peanut butter can lay the foundation for balanced energy and long-term wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sunlight exposure and routine regulation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stepping outside for a few minutes soon after waking resets the circadian rhythm and helps regulate hormones, particularly cortisol and melatonin. Strong circadian rhythm supports DNA repair and immune surveillance, which are critical protective mechanisms against abnormal cell growth. Consistent sleep and wake timing paired with morning light exposure improves recovery and reduces chronic inflammation. Better sleep quality strengthens defence systems while maintaining mental clarity and emotional balance. A stable internal rhythm is one of the simplest yet most effective wellbeing tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Avoid tobacco and alcohol&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using tobacco or alcohol early in the morning increases exposure to carcinogens when the body is most vulnerable after overnight cellular repair. Both substances damage cells and increase the likelihood of mutations that can develop into cancer. Beginning the day without smoking or drinking significantly reduces avoidable stress on the body and supports the natural detoxification process. Replacing these habits with water or herbal tea supports hydration and digestion and protects organs, including lungs, liver and throat from unnecessary strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Schedule health checks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routine self-checks and preventive screenings strengthen early detection. A short monthly check and scheduled screenings help identify changes early, when treatment is most effective. Many cancers respond significantly better when discovered in early stages. Creating a simple reminder system, such as marking a calendar or setting an alert each month, helps build consistency. Understanding your body and observing any unusual changes is a powerful step towards long-term safety and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer prevention begins with daily actions rather than dramatic lifestyle shifts. These five morning habits work together by strengthening immune function, reducing inflammation, improving repair systems and limiting exposure to harmful triggers. When practised consistently, they create meaningful, cumulative benefits for physical health and emotional stability. The first hour of your day becomes an investment in resilience, energy, and a future defined by wellbeing instead of illness. Small habits generate lasting change and guide the body towards long-term protection and balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This content is intended purely for informational use and is not a substitute for professional medical, nutritional or scientific advice.

Yet, despite popping supplements religiously, many people still find their vitamin D levels stubbornly low. Sounds familiar? You’re not alone. A lot of us start taking vitamin D tablets or weekly sachets without really understanding what affects absorption, when to take it, or what lifestyle factors could be blocking results. So if your reports still show deficiency even after months of supplements, doctors say there are some crucial details you might be missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We at TOI spoke to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr Shovana Veshnavi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Principal Consultant- Internal Medicine, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Noida; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Consultant- Gastroenterology &amp;amp; Hepatology, Yatharth Super Speciality Hospital, Faridabad; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Senior Consultant- Gastroenterology, Medanta Hospital Noida to shed light on why some people continue to lack this essential vitamin in their body even after taking pills and supplements regularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Easy ways to increase your Vitamin D intake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is considered an &lt;keyword id="31185279" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="optimal-range-of-vitamin-D" source="Orion"&gt;optimal range of vitamin D&lt;/keyword&gt; for different age groups?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to Vitamin D, balance is everything, too little weakens bones and immunity, and too much can actually be harmful. Experts say knowing your ideal range can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shovana Veshnavi explains that for overall health, the sweet spot for 25(OH)D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) levels is usually between 30–50 ng/ml for most age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Echoing similar views, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra says older adults need a little more support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also reminds that infants and pregnant women should monitor their levels closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala suggests 40–65/70 ng/ml for athletes, pregnant women, and elders with osteoporosis. He cautions that levels above 100 ng/ml risk toxicity, and 150 ng/ml is clinically dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Calcium &amp;amp; Vitamin D Deficiency in India: Bridging the Nutritional Absorption Gap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Many people take Vitamin D supplements regularly but still show low levels. What are the most common reasons behind this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been popping Vitamin D supplements faithfully and your reports still show low levels—don’t worry, you’re not alone. Experts say there are several hidden reasons why Vitamin D doesn’t always rise the way we expect it to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shovana Veshnavi explains that low Vitamin D often persists because of inadequate or inconsistent dosing, or because people take Vitamin D without dietary fat, which is essential for absorption. She also highlights that obesity can trap Vitamin D in fat tissues, making less available for the body to use. Conditions like intestinal disorders, genetic differences, and medications such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids can all interfere with Vitamin D metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to this, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra says that even regular supplementation can fail if there are absorption problems, organ-related issues like kidney or liver disease, poor dosing, or low-quality supplements. Timing and consistency matter more than many people realize, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala points out that many people take only 1,000 IU per day, which may simply not be enough for them. He stresses that Vitamin D is fat-soluble, so taking it on an empty stomach reduces absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do nutrients like magnesium, Vitamin K2, and calcium interact with Vitamin D, and why are they important for absorption and function?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to Vitamin D, it doesn’t work alone, it teams up with a few key nutrients to actually do its job well. If you’re low on any of those, Vitamin D may not activate properly, no matter how much you supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala says that magnesium is a major cofactor in Vitamin D activation in the liver and kidneys, and without it, Vitamin D stays inactive. Vitamin K2 helps prevent vascular calcification by directing calcium to the right place, and adequate calcium intake is crucial because Vitamin D and calcium are partners in bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 Signs you are having too much Vitamin D&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Echoing this, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra says that magnesium, Vitamin D, and Vitamin K2 function as a team—magnesium activates Vitamin D, Vitamin K2 ensures calcium goes to the bones (not arteries), and calcium needs Vitamin D to be absorbed and built into bone. When all three are aligned, bone health improves and Vitamin D works more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can gut health or digestive issues affect Vitamin D absorption? If so, how can individuals improve this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Vitamin D is absorbed in the small intestine, anything that interferes with digestion can interfere with absorption too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shovana Veshnavi explains that gut issues such as celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, IBS, SIBO, chronic pancreatitis, or fatty liver can significantly reduce Vitamin D absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting this, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra says that conditions like chronic diarrhoea, inflammatory gut diseases, or previous intestinal surgeries can severely impair the body’s ability to absorb Vitamin D. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding more detail, Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala emphasizes that Vitamin D absorption requires proper fat digestion. In diseases of the small intestine, pancreatic insufficiency, cholestatic liver disease, obstructive jaundice, or after bariatric surgery, absorption drops sharply. To improve it, he advises taking Vitamin D with the day’s largest fatty meal, ensuring enough magnesium, eating whole grains, fruits, and fermented foods, and addressing malabsorption medically when needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does lifestyle—such as screen time, indoor living, and sunscreen use—impact Vitamin D synthesis from sunlight?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, most of us spend more time under roofs and behind screens than under the sun, and experts say that shift has dramatically affected natural Vitamin D production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Vitamin D deficiency: Doctor explains causes,  symptoms and prevention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shovana Veshnavi explains that indoor living and excessive screen time have reduced how much UVB exposure our body gets during the day. UVB is the wavelength the skin needs to make Vitamin D, but it cannot penetrate glass, meaning sitting by a sunny window doesn’t count. She adds that sunscreen can block up to 95% of Vitamin D synthesis, and air pollution also filters UVB rays, making sunlight even less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agreeing on the impact of modern habits, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra recommends 10–30 minutes of direct sunlight exposure, three to four times a week, to help restore levels naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala emphasizes that air pollution is a major factor in preventing UVB rays from reaching the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line? Step outside more often, catch some gentle sunlight, and let your body do what it’s designed to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are there certain medical conditions or medications that interfere with Vitamin D levels?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say that certain medical conditions and long-term treatments can prevent the body from absorbing, storing, or activating Vitamin D properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shovana Veshnavi explains that a range of medications—like anticonvulsants, glucocorticoids, rifampicin, antiretrovirals, antifungals, and long-term PPIs (acid-reducing drugs)—can either speed up the breakdown of Vitamin D or interfere with fat absorption, which is essential for Vitamin D utilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Echoing this, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra says that kidney disease, liver disease, and obesity commonly disrupt Vitamin D storage and activation. Some medicines, including steroids, anticonvulsants, and cholestyramine, can further reduce absorption, meaning levels stay low even with consistent supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding more detail, Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala highlights that conditions like hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, malabsorption disorders can all interfere with Vitamin D status. He notes that anti-epileptic medications, tuberculosis drugs such as rifampicin, steroids, and HIV medications may also significantly lower Vitamin D levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What form of Vitamin D supplement (D2 vs D3) is most effective, and how should it ideally be taken, timing, dosing, with or without food?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to boosting Vitamin D levels effectively, not all forms, and not all dosing habits, are created equal. Experts agree that Vitamin D3 is the superior choice for raising and maintaining healthy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shovana Veshnavi explains that Vitamin D3 is more effective than Vitamin D2 in elevating Vitamin D levels and sustaining them over time. To get the best results, she recommends taking D3 with a high-fat meal and preferably in the morning or afternoon. She adds that daily or weekly dosing works far better than extremely high monthly doses, and combining D3 with Magnesium and Vitamin K2 helps maintain balance and long-term stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala adds that weekly D3 dosing is commonly preferred and more stable than taking a huge monthly dose. For people with malabsorption issues, he suggests considering calcifediol (25-hydroxy D), which can be more effective than regular cholecalciferol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="101"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting this, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra points out that Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) stays active longer in the body compared to D2. While timing isn’t critical, taking it at the same time each day is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="103"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="104"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What symptoms should people watch for if they suspect Vitamin D deficiency despite supplementation?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="105"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="107"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been popping vitamin D supplements regularly but still feel drained and achy, you’re definitely not alone. According to Dr. Shovana Vaishnavi, persistent fatigue, muscle or bone pain, low stamina, hair loss, recurrent infections, low mood, sleep disturbances, chronic back pain, stress fractures, or slow recovery after surgery could all be red flags that your vitamin D levels are still low. Women may even notice menstrual irregularities as a sign of deficiency. If symptoms continue despite supplementation, she says there might be underlying issues like poor absorption or incorrect dosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="112"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to this, Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala stresses that supplements alone aren’t magic—daily lifestyle habits matter too. Safe sun exposure, strength training, weight-bearing exercises, and a nutrient-rich diet make a big difference. Think fish, egg yolks, fortified milk, nuts, legumes, greens, fermented foods and cheese—foods rich in calcium, magnesium, and vitamin K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="116"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Dr. Dhruv Kant Mishra points out that continuing symptoms like low immunity, frequent infections, and mood changes may indicate that the body still isn’t absorbing vitamin D properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="118"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="119"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Apart from supplements, what everyday practices or foods can naturally support better Vitamin D utilisation and overall bone and immune health?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to getting the most out of your vitamin D supplements, lifestyle plays a bigger role than most people realize. Dr. Amogh Dudhwewala explains that improving gut health is key because a healthy gut supports better nutrient absorption—including vitamin D. He also strongly advises cutting down on smoking and heavy alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="123"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Dr. Shovana Vaishnavi highlights the power of safe sunlight exposure, particularly on the arms and legs, as one of the most natural and effective ways to boost vitamin D levels. She also recommends adding more vitamin-D-rich foods to your plate, like salmon, egg yolks, cod liver oil and UV-exposed mushrooms. She points out that lifestyle habits such as adequate sleep, stress management, strengthening exercises, maintaining a healthy waistline, including omega-3s, eating fermented foods, and prioritizing gut health all improve how effectively the body uses vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 05:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgJBVV95cUxQVHhrNGxNNlVHRXAtV0RWdXBSdjVNSjVGZkRtbXhaVTlJUjRoM2JHZGFOV2lOX3ltSFdrQnU4NHFpQ29Ubmt5cFpSUXFuZmdqWG5hcm5ubVVjMkRvWTFjdk9pd01iRnNSVFFvNnF0N0tycmw4RVF3dXRYRnh0bExUYXlLeHNIWDBNaUUtZVZndXNoWkdXeEhMWURHNTRxNU9lcW5rc0pVcGhyR2l2ZFhYZnM4R0F3c3I5ZG5wVmVUdXNZbW40dDVsSE1YbXR6d2NSQVdnWS1GcnlVY0l0cXduMUpqSko4VXVDQThkbjUtNTh4S2JMcXBrbVUtd0RmcUxuMGxweHF6bmFDZGVJUERyOFRB</guid></item><item><title>澳大利亚药物监管机构对包括Ozempic在内的减肥药物发出心理健康警告--《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/dec/01/mental-health-warning-issued-for-weight-loss-drugs-including-ozempic-in-australia</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The medicines regulator has added two new safety warnings about mental health and contraception for people taking high-profile diabetes and weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While there is no proof of a causal association, experts say the risks are significant enough that awareness is important as part of a precautionary approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) says that because suicidal behaviour and ideation have been reported with these relatively new GLP-1 receptor agonists, doctors should “monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behaviours, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behaviour”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The warning of the potential risk of suicidal thoughts applies across the GLP-1 RA class of medicines (often called semaglutides), including Ozempic, Wegovy, Saxenda, Trulicity and Mounjaro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;amp;CMP=emailbutton" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;&lt;sub class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sign up: AU Breaking News email&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2822453?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=082024" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; analysed the World Health Organization’s global database of adverse reactions and found reports of suicidal thoughts were slightly higher than expected for semaglutide, even when compared to other diabetes drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Following this international signal (an adverse event that is potentially caused by a medicine that warrants further investigation), the TGA asked its Advisory Committee on Medicines for independent expert advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They found there was not enough evidence for causality, but noted there was a complex interplay between mental illness and chronic endocrine disorders for which GLP-1 RAs may be used for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A search of the TGA’s database of adverse event notifications for the GLP-1 RA class up to September found there were 72 reports for suicidal ideation, six reports for depressional suicide, four reports of suicide attempt, two reports of completed suicide and one report of self-injurious ideation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Data on semaglutide prescriptions on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme show there were &lt;a href="https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/professional/are-we-at-a-watershed-moment-for-weight-loss-drugs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more than two million in 2023-24&lt;/a&gt;, but there would be &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/16/ozempic-can-cost-almost-2000-a-year-australias-peak-medical-body-says-it-should-be-on-the-pbs-for-weight-loss" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;even more users whose use wasn’t subsidised.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Terri-Lynne South, the chair of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners’ specific interest group for obesity management, said: “We do think there might be a subgroup of patients who may be more vulnerable to a worsening of their mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“At the moment, that seems to be people who might already have a past or current history of depression or anxiety or on a antidepressant type medication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Studies of patients who have undergone bariatric surgery have also shown that significant or rapid weight loss can be a “real triggering event from a mental health point of view,” South said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The TGA has also issued a separate warning around Mounjaro and contraception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After investigating the potential reduced effectiveness of oral contraception when first taking or increasing the dose of Mounjaro, the TGA said it could not rule out an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As a precautionary measure, it has updated the product warnings for Mounjaro to include further advice for patients using oral contraceptives to switch to a non-oral contraceptive or add a barrier method of contraception for four weeks after first taking the medicine and for four weeks after each increase in the dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It added that none of the GLP-1 RA class of medicine should be used during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;South said since Mounjaro had been available in Australia, the product information had mentioned potential concerns around the delay in gastric emptying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“What that means is [the drug] delays the food and everything else that you eat actually coming through the digestive system, and therefore having an impact on the absorption of the oral contraceptive pill, and therefore possibly the effectiveness of the oral contraceptive pill,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;South said the warnings were part of normal post-market surveillance, which meant due to the smaller numbers of people involved in initial drug trials, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/23/two-very-rare-covid-vaccine-side-effects-detected-in-global-study-of-99-million" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;some associations can’t be seen until tens of thousands of people&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="ed73074d-3687-4448-bba9-f729a283fb7f"&gt;In every decade, the body goes through changes but this is especially true for women in their 40s. Hormonal shifts can affect metabolic health, bone density and even mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/tag/menopause" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/tag/menopause"&gt;Menopause&lt;/a&gt; and perimenopause—the lead up to menopause—can begin at any age, though most people experience it in their 40s and 50s (and some may enter premature menopause in their 20s and 30s). Regardless of when it begins, these changes can affect muscle mass, joint health and overall strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="ed73074d-3687-4448-bba9-f729a283fb7f-2"&gt;Certified personal trainer &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.trainerize.me/profile/dynamicbodyloading/Stephanie.Woods" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.trainerize.me/profile/dynamicbodyloading/Stephanie.Woods" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;Stephanie Woods&lt;/a&gt; works with women over 40 to help counter this decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once we hit our 40s, the body naturally begins a process called sarcopenia—the loss of muscle mass,” she says. “This decline accelerates with inactivity, leading to decreased strength, slower metabolism, and increased risk of falls and fractures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woods tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well &lt;/em&gt;that rebuilding or maintaining muscle through resistance training helps preserve functional movement, improves insulin sensitivity, supports healthy body composition, and even boosts mood and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Simply put: strong muscles are a foundation for long-term health and independence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve hit your 40s and have never picked up a dumbbell, you’re far from alone. Many people start training later in life or return to exercise after a long break. According to Woods, it’s actually one of the best decades to start moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-5JeE9USFKjQLdLXpT2sG6f" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-5JeE9USFKjQLdLXpT2sG6f slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s never too late,” she says. “In your 40s, you’re likely still in good health, but muscle and bone density are starting to decline. This means that small, consistent efforts now can dramatically improve your future quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Strength training at this stage not only reverses early muscle loss but also improves joint integrity, metabolism, and hormone balance,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginners, she says, can make fast, measurable progress with simple, consistent training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maintaining strength isn’t just about fitness, it’s about independence, vitality and longevity,” says Woods. “Strength training plays a huge role in your healthspan and not just your lifespan,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, Woods has chosen three beginner-friendly, equipment-light exercises that lay the foundations for lifelong strength and joint health. She’s also included modifications for those who are still progressing to the full move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-bodyweight-squat" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-bodyweight-squat"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

The box squat variation helps build confidence and strength for lowering deeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-push-up" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-push-up"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.

They also help maintain bone density in the arms and spine. For beginners, incline push-ups—with your hands on a countertop, box or bench—make the movement accessible while still building strength.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to do it:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="3f8fe7aa-4c83-4431-8c37-45bb5d0c4aa5"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start on your hands and knees, with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart on the floor or a bench or wall for the incline version.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Step back so your body forms a straight line from your head to your heels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower your body down by bending at the elbows until your chest comes close to the floor or incline surface.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Push back up to the starting position, keeping your core and buttocks tight and back straight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="78dd1bc1-31ab-41f7-a277-a8a9e5a2e6e1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expert tip: &lt;/strong&gt;Beginners can start with a wall or countertop push-up and lower the surface height gradually over time as you get stronger and can do it from the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-bird-dog" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-bird-dog"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.

			&lt;p&gt;Specific immune cells in the brain may play a crucial role in preventing the onset of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new study – a discovery that could lead to new therapies that try to coax cells into this protective state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.05.003"&gt;Earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that immune cells in the brain called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microglia"&gt;microglia&lt;/a&gt; can effectively tackle the symptoms of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="183250" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, but also make them worse through inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, an international team of scientists took a detailed look at how microglia switch between those two helpful and harmful modes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mouse models of Alzheimer's, Icahn School of Medicine neuroscientist Pinar Ayata and colleagues found that when microglia get close to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/supplement-for-high-blood-pressure-clears-signs-of-alzheimers-in-mice"&gt;amyloid-beta protein&lt;/a&gt; clumps, a tell-tale sign of the disease, they enter a special state of neuroprotection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-may-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-reveals-expert"&gt;Alzheimer's May Not Actually Be a Brain Disease, Reveals Expert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microglia are not simply destructive responders in Alzheimer's disease – they can become the brain's protectors," &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2025/protective-microglia-subtype-offers-potential-new-therapeutic-pathway-in-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Anne Schaefer, from the Icahn School of Medicine in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This finding extends our earlier observations on the remarkable plasticity of microglia states and their important roles in diverse brain functions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183253" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183253" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MicrogliaScan.jpg" alt="Microglia in mouse brains" class="wp-image-183253 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MicrogliaScan.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MicrogliaScan-600x505.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183253" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Microglia (green) responding to amyloid-beta plaques (blue) in the mouse brain. (Ayata et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seem to be two crucial characteristics of this microglia subtype: The cells have lower levels of a protein previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4587"&gt;linked to Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, called PU.1, and a greater expression of a protein called CD28, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.immunol.14.1.233"&gt;a crucial participant&lt;/a&gt; in the wider immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microglia with this combination were better able to slow down the build-up of amyloid-beta protein clumps in mouse brains, while also limiting aggregations of tau – another potentially toxic protein &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sky-high-levels-of-alzheimers-protein-found-in-newborns"&gt;associated with Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also stopped CD28 production in mice, finding that harmful, inflammation-causing microglia became more abundant, and that amyloid-beta plaques became more common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This all fits with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4587"&gt;earlier studies&lt;/a&gt; that have found the onset of Alzheimer's tends to happen later in life among individuals with a genetic disposition towards lower PU.1 expression in specific cells, compared to the general average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results provide a mechanistic explanation for why lower PU.1 levels are linked to reduced Alzheimer's disease risk," &lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/25641673/protective-brain-immune-cell-state-discovered"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; geneticist Alison Goate, from the Icahn School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seems to be a natural defense against &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-4-distinct-patterns-may-signal-alzheimers-according-to-science"&gt;Alzheimer's in the brain&lt;/a&gt;, but one which clearly isn't powerful enough to fully stop the disease from progressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are hopeful that future therapies might be able to increase the levels of this microglia subtype – though we need to make sure microglia work the same way in humans first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's is an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-of-our-biggest-hopes-for-alzheimers-treatment-doesnt-seem-to-work"&gt;incredibly complex&lt;/a&gt; disease, involving &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-one-critical-thing-you-can-do-to-keep-alzheimers-symptoms-at-bay"&gt;a host of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-at-one-stage-of-life-may-cut-dementia-risk-by-up-to-45"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt;, and so an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;effective treatment&lt;/a&gt; will probably need to take aim at several targets at once. One mechanism researchers might consider for future studies is converting microglia into this neuroprotective mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also adds to our understanding of how Alzheimer's fits in with the immune system as a whole. The modified microglia identified in this study, in mouse brains, act in a similar way to&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newly-discovered-t-cells-could-rid-late-stage-cancer-patients-of-tumors"&gt; T cells&lt;/a&gt; that roam around the rest of the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery comes at a time when regulatory T cells have achieved major recognition as master regulators of immunity, highlighting a shared logic of immune regulation across cell types," &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2025/protective-microglia-subtype-offers-potential-new-therapeutic-pathway-in-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;epigeneticist Alexander Tarakhovsky&lt;/span&gt;, from the Rockefeller University in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It also paves the way for immunotherapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09662-z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

confirming she was healthy, she laughed even harder which annoyed her mother&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, the OP lived in a &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/art/home-design/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; where her body was constantly under scrutiny. At 140 pounds which was well within a normal range for her age, she was repeatedly called “fat”, especially by her older brother who ironically ate far more and moved far less. This same brother would call her “overweight” and warn her that she was going to develop a heart disease with the way she ate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she received no &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/worst-thing-happened-on-birthday/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;birthday&lt;/a&gt; treats, and often went without lunch or breakfast, her brother got bottomless servings justified by the fact that he was just “a growing boy”. Every time food went missing, from juice to leftovers, she was instantly blamed. It didn’t matter if she was at school all day or simply hadn’t touched it, her family was convinced she was the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, she stopped defending herself and would remain quiet, but one day, her brother told their mother he felt sluggish and dehydrated and he was taken to the &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/lifestyle/health/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt;. A doctor ordered bloodwork, and the results came back with her brother diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. The shock was so intense, but the OP couldn’t help laughing at the irony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their mother, furious that she dared to laugh, dragged her to get blood tests too, but her result came out and she was completely healthy. The OP laughed harder this time which made her &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/ex-gifted-kid-traceable-airpods/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; even more furious, leading her to tell the extended family about how she laughed at her “unfortunate” brother. Now, the whole family was lashing out at her which left her wondering if she was wrong for laughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_desktop_post_infinite_0" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teen boy in a medical exam room looking at doctor preparing a syringe, representing diabetes and weight health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="brother-diagnosis-diabetes-1" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/brother-diagnosis-diabetes/?image_id=brother-diagnosis-diabetes-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Am I The Jerk For Laughing When My Brother Was Diagnosed With Diabetes?" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/brother-diagnosis-diabetes/?media_id=brother-diagnosis-diabetes-1" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/brother-diagnosis-diabetes-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9705628" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/brother-diagnosis-diabetes-1.jpg" alt="Teen boy in a medical exam room looking at doctor preparing a syringe, representing diabetes and weight health concerns." title="Teen boy in a medical exam room looking at doctor preparing a syringe, representing diabetes and weight health concerns." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/coronavirus-sample-procedure_10623631.htm#fromView=search&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;position=0&amp;amp;uuid=ad6e0faa-7944-43ff-ab80-9a9537449a06&amp;amp;query=teen+boy+doctor+appointment" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;freepik / Freepik (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In situations like the one described in the OP’s case, the family dynamics reflect patterns of scapegoating. According to &lt;a href="https://www.choosingtherapy.com/family-scapegoat/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Choosing Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, family scapegoating occurs when one person is unfairly blamed for the family’s problems, absorbing criticism and frustration that really belong to the household as a whole or another family member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other members project their guilt, insecurity, or unresolved emotional issues onto the scapegoated individual, often using manipulative tactics like &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/exhausting-relationship-fb-pics/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;gaslighting&lt;/a&gt; or triangulation to reinforce the blame and further isolate the target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These dynamics are often worsened by sibling favoritism. As the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230809-the-lifelong-effects-of-the-favourite-child" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; explains, when one child is consistently favored, the others can feel overlooked, jealous, or inadequate, potentially leading to anxiety or low self-esteem. Meanwhile, the favored child may face pressure or develop a sense of entitlement, straining family bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compounding these issues is a family culture that emphasizes blame over communication. Life coach &lt;a href="https://www.melissalloyd.org/unraveling-family-dysfunction-the-role-of-poor-communication/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Melissa Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; notes that families operating this way often fall into cycles of conflict and emotional distance as frequent victim-blaming, sarcastic assumptions, and top-down authority stifle open dialogue and prevent healthy problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netizens were firmly on the OP’s side, emphasizing that she wasn’t wrong for laughing and pointing out the clear irony of the situation. They agreed that her laughter wasn’t cruelty but a reaction to the poetic justice on display.

These reasons are not based on mere hearsay, but rather on very valid observations from clinical practice and from the experiences of patients themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Decline in Vitamin D levels&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most influential factors in winter is the reduction of vitamin D, an important modulator of immune function. In winter, shorter days with less direct sun means we synthesize less vitamin D. Specialists recommend checking vitamin D levels twice a year, typically in autumn and spring, so that supplementation can be tailored to keep values in the optimal range for immune stability. For autoimmune patients, maintaining serum vitamin D around 100 to 120 nmol/L helps to create an environment for a more balanced immune response. This is usually not achieved via a standard multivitamin; indeed, targeted dosing may make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Foods that boost immunity before winter sets in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Disrupted melatonin &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another hidden culprit is fluctuating melatonin levels. Winter brings reduced sunlight and longer nights, which may affect the circadian rhythm and melatonin production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contributing factors include less time outdoors, more indoor sedentary activity, and greater evening exposure to blue light from screens. Evening blue light exposure is particularly problematic, as it suppresses melatonin, an important hormone for both sleep and immune regulation. The specialists in autoimmunity recommend maximizing daylight, minimizing screen time near bedtime, and incorporating into the diet foods that naturally raise melatonin levels, such as pistachios, eggs, mushrooms, and cherries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Increase in viral infections&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The colder months make people highly susceptible to respiratory and viral infections. Such infections might ignite or act as a triggering factor in autoimmune diseases, potentially leading to flare-ups or even worsening of ongoing inflammation. That would make prevention of infection via hygiene and good lifestyle habits, coupled with vaccination if needed, particularly important for people with compromised immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dietary and lifestyle changes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winter tends to enhance refined carbohydrate and sugar intake, both well-known to negatively impact gut health. Gut integrity is particularly important in individuals with autoimmunity, and clinicians have noted that diets high in sugar exacerbate inflammation. Additionally, most people with autoimmune disease have some intolerance to gluten and sometimes dairy, so seasonal shifts toward comfort foods can inadvertently trigger symptom flare-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reduced activity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another point specialists make is that colder weather means less movement and reduced physical activity. Regular exercise is very supportive of immune health and reduces joint stiffness common in autoimmune disorders. As it gets colder, people tend to become more sedentary, missing the benefits of daily stretching, movement, and possibly therapeutic practices like infrared sauna or gentle yoga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Comprehensive Prevention Strategies&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialists in autoimmune diseases recommend a multi-pronged approach for winters: exposure to sunlight or supplementation of vitamin D, planning regular movement even indoors, monitoring carbohydrate and gluten intake, and maintaining sleep hygiene. Small changes-like walking outdoors during daylight hours, consuming food that helps stimulate melatonin, and regular stretching-can add up and reduce frequency and severity of flare-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;To conclude:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winter brings many unique challenges for people living with autoimmune diseases, and understanding why symptoms worsen is itself a kind of empowerment. For many, supplementation of vitamin D deficiency, support of natural sleep rhythms, adherence to anti-inflammatory diet, and regular physical activity bring about much-improved stability and resilience during the season. It goes to prove that with insight and a host of preventive strategies, seasonal setbacks are just not inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 02:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxQZGVFanRTVlFRNEl5VTFDN29DU0RiaXlKTXBBU3Z6amMtLUpWR2NyUlJVLXpqYkNOTlIyYWU1Qm85cDFIVS1oWC1jZzczWTFKWGtCMGJUaE9oNlBkY2dhZ1pseG1fbmdCQjdtbHNDV0RLMGFDUWNUd3MxdTR5MFB3dnF3ckxaeFk3S1hrazY1TlhWWmhrMXFjZnNIZlhhUkVvNUl4a1Nwa2NCa3NyM2VZTXhaSU9nNUJaT1pIMnplQkdVaFA1dTIzb1FoV0w1eGlacDNNdU5nanJFeGVsSGZJTVBn</guid></item><item><title>切罗基县男子开车一小时，浣熊穿着外套，脸部被咬，后来得知有狂犬病- 11Alive.com</title><link>https://www.11alive.com/article/life/animals/rabid-raccoon-bites-cherokee-county-man-in-face-during-car-ride-sparks-rabies-scare-after-refusing-treatment/85-30871aa8-7981-4644-ad0a-2a90633753f2</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;The man refused to provide his real name and gave the hospital a fake phone number, delaying contact tracing, according to officials.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROSWELL, Ga. — A Cherokee County man’s attempt to rescue an injured raccoon spiraled into a bizarre and dangerous rabies scare this week at the Chattahoochee Nature Center, according to a statement from the center.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials said the man found the raccoon vocalizing in the road and, lacking anything to keep the raccoon isolated in, he wrapped it in his coat and held it against his chest for more than an hour while driving to the nature center, despite the center being listed to not accept raccoons.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the drive, the raccoon freed its head and bit the man on the face and hands, according to the center. He then drove home, secured the raccoon in a blanket with duct tape and proceeded to the nature center, arriving an hour before its wildlife clinic opened. Children were simultaneously arriving for a day camp at the CNC.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staff met him in the parking lot and insisted he seek medical treatment while they secured the animal. CNC officials said that after "much forceful insistence," he finally agreed to go get checked out at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nearby veterinary hospital agreed to accept the raccoon for euthanasia and testing, and a Georgia Wildlife Network transporter moved it from the nature center to the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within 48 hours, test results confirmed the raccoon was positive for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials said the man initially refused to provide his real name and gave the hospital a fake phone number, delaying contact tracing. It was only when a family member called the CNC the next day that they were able to get accurate contact information for the man.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They stressed the importance of calling licensed wildlife rehabilitators before intervening and warned that untreated rabies in humans is almost always deadly.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

But one day, she noticed that the fingers on her right hand were starting to go numb — and it didn’t take long before her arms and legs followed suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My fingers kind of just stopped working,” Suisted, 27, recalled to &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/lifestyle/fitness-wellbeing/article-15322615/brain-tumour-disappears-Paige-Suisted.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daily Mail Australia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Mail Australia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, noting that she received differing opinions from multiple doctors. “One said I had a stroke, but didn't even admit me to the hospital. Another said I had Raynaud's disease, and one just put me in a sling. They all told me something completely different.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Hospital (stock image)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having grown increasingly desperate, Suisted eventually called an ambulance and pleaded to be admitted to a hospital for proper testing. After weeks of CT scans, MRIs and a brain biopsy, she was diagnosed with stage-four astrocytoma, a terminal cancer often found in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When they told me, I think I screamed and cried,” she told &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail Australia.&lt;/em&gt; “It was so hard to hear. I have a younger brother and sister, and all I could think about was wanting to see them grow up.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After discovering that the golf ball-sized tumor in her brain was pushing on the nerves controlling the right side of her body, doctors determined that surgical removal would be too risky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a 50–50 chance it would work, and a 50–50 chance I'd be fully paralyzed, most likely not able to talk or walk again,” Suisted recalled to the outlet. “So, we decided we weren't doing that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suisted immediately began to undergo radiation and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The terminal diagnosis broke a lot of us down. I thought I was going to die and there's nothing anyone can do,” she recalled. “At the start of chemo, it really shot me down. I wasn't even aware of what was going on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a year of treatment and debilitating symptoms, many of which she documented on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/journey_through_cancer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Instagram;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, doctors were shocked to find that, one day, Suisted's brain scans appeared to come back clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my last few scans, there's been nothing there,” she told &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail Australia. &lt;/em&gt;“This massive golf ball in my brain … we can't see any of it on the MRIs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While doctors can’t officially declare Suisted cancer-free without performing surgery to make sure there aren't any remaining cancer cells, multiple professional opinions have deemed her a “medical anomaly,” and she has since been on a journey to regain her independence and confidence while advocating for others facing the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They haven't had a cancer patient like this,” she said of her doctors. “They don't even understand it themselves. I just live my life every day now, and I want to help other people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/woman-27-diagnosed-with-terminal-brain-cancer-until-doctors-found-something-incredible-11859020" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 00:44:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE94Q3NUSDRBS0F5S3hVYjNkLThFNC13eDZZN0ktQmZCTVhHTzBYV2poVU9ENTdpbGtjSW9xVzNBUlZEbEtOLWtGYURpMmdSbGRGVzEtbkN0TmZhZkdJaTIwek9QOC14dlRVaWdLQWhjNWg3dW8</guid></item><item><title>心脏病风险较高的南印度人：突破性的基因研究揭示-德干先驱报</title><link>https://www.deccanherald.com/india/south-indians-more-prone-to-heart-disease-study-3815339</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="story-content-7ca60d47-9f3d-4741-a559-7236d133ead0" class="story-cards taboola-read-more-container"&gt;&lt;p class="wW6Na"&gt;Published 30 November 2025, 23:22 IST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deccan Herald</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 23:22:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOT0hoeU5lT3dOUmNwYnlROHdDRy1wXzZacGc3SWcwVG45dTg0amQxVXd0X1p5VDFCNlRhRllpeTdJLWtickFCd2l3VDE5SzNpcW1ERUN6eDFTd1VxdnNMRmhmWGI5dVZfZUZrTElzMHY1RHBsTU1sYkJTV1F4MExVRFc0b25ZUm92RjY3bEV0Mlg0ZlJ6</guid></item><item><title>皮肤科医生解释了为什么在脸上使用Phitkari可能有害-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/dermatologist-explains-why-using-phitkari-on-face-can-be-harmful/articleshow/125679648.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phitkari, or alum, has long been promoted as a simple, inexpensive home remedy for common skin concerns. Its natural astringent and antibacterial properties make it popular as a toner, aftershave and even an anti-acne hack. But despite its traditional reputation, modern dermatology raises important questions about how safe it truly is for facial skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent video, popular dermatologist Dr. Jushya Bhatia Sarin shared how using Alum or phitkari on the face can do more harm than good. Emerging research shows that what seems harmless on the surface may have effects that most people don’t consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Phitkari’s salt structure &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jushya highlights that phitkari is a sulphate. is chemically a double sulphate salt, potassium aluminium sulphate, and its structure is what gives it strong astringent and desiccating properties, which means it has a strong dehydrating effect on the skin. Dr Jushya says, “Phitkari dries and stretches the skin, as it dries out water from the surface”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Secrets to anti-ageing: 7 simple daily habits that give us healthy skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phitkari has historically been used as a styptic, i.e., a substance that helps stop minor bleeding from small cuts or shaving nicks. Its strong astringent action causes blood vessels and surface tissues to contract quickly, which is helpful for tiny wounds. Here Dr. Jushya says that phitkari was sold in ancient markets, not to use on the skin or underarms, but to reduce the amount of sweat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This translates that alum’s traditional use for cuts doesn’t translate to safe everyday skincare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;No skin-brightening action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another misconception Dr. Jushya addresses is the belief that alum can lighten spots, pigmentation or tan. Chemically, alum’s formula contains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No pigment-reducing properties&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No ability to influence melanin production&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No pathways that affect skin-brightening mechanisms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6152334/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;show that melanin regulation requires ingredients that work on tyrosinase or melanocyte activity, something alum cannot do. This means phitkari cannot fade dark spots, treat hyperpigmentation, or provide any brightening effect, despite widespread social media claims. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing Dr. Jushya highlights is that physical scrubs, especially those using hard, jagged or coarse particles, can cause microscopic tears or “micro-cuts” in the outermost layer of skin. In controlled studies, repeated rubbing or mechanical abrasion has been shown to damage the skin barrier: an in-vitro study found that mechanical rubbing markedly reduced barrier function, increasing skin permeability to water and other substances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the barrier is compromised like this, the skin becomes more vulnerable to environmental irritants, UV radiation, and infections, all factors that can trigger inflammation or stress responses. These, in turn, may stimulate pigment-producing cells (melanocytes), leading to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), particularly in medium-to-dark skin types. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;In short: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;using harsh scrubs, or rubbing vigorously, can cause tiny skin injuries that weaken the skin’s natural protection. As the skin tries to heal from these repeated micro-traumas, pigment changes (dark spots), sensitivity, dryness or even acne may follow, precisely the opposite of the “glow up” many scrubs promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9wFBVV95cUxQVGRjdW93aVY0bnh1RVQxTVRMX3hhV1plb3l0a3lmUDgyNnNVcndaS0ZjRE1yU1kxdExjRjR5cG5hRWVmMmJiaFhQQUp3dUttSDdtdFZ0Y2xheGRVWlkzZ3lTMldkcnNjVnU4c3NRdml1S3FqTmdsVVlJNjBwOVBYaUdWUFpCbkF6b2xNV25Jdl9HNHlKM3RNcGEtQTR3SEZILVN3LWVscFhuQ05PQlc1R3RuNmpkUGFTQTZPN04wVEd2dElWNnpUbFJSTklEWGpaWXZtUkVSbU9VUXAwdVk0VDRrSTUtS3FRaXVKS0E4WDVtS2hubkJR</guid></item><item><title>“突破性”艾滋病毒预防计划旨在到2030年结束传播-《独立报》</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/hiv-prevention-programme-end-transmissions-2030-b2875184.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 bxpovR sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 iBibVd"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 jVZWGn"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 eZqxmv"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 tawua"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 gZmYS"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 iCTyfe"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

Today, people living with HIV can enjoy full, healthy lives – and can’t pass the virus on to others. That’s remarkable progress. But we can go further. Ending new HIV transmissions by 2030 is ambitious – and this government is determined to make it happen," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DHSC confirmed that the plan will specifically target approximately 5,000 individuals living with HIV who are no longer receiving care, often due to mental health issues, addiction, poverty, or fear of judgement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To combat stigma, hospital staff in trusts implementing the opt-out scheme will receive anti-stigma training, ensuring patients can access care without fear of discrimination based on their HIV status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further enhancing accessibility, a £5 million trial, announced on Sunday, will enable at-risk patients to order home HIV testing kits directly through the NHS App. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This digital service offers a discreet route for those anxious about their sexual health to get tested, receive results securely, and connect with their GP or sexual health clinics from their phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Streeting added: "We’ll bring people into life-saving care and find infections early, when treatment works best, so everyone can live the full, healthy life they deserve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our national re-engagement programme, a truly innovative and agile approach, targets the epidemic where it’s growing and leaving no one behind."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dRiJXI"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/27/21/2248101652.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/27/21/2248101652.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/27/21/2248101652.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Keir Starmer hopes to bring an end to HIV transmissions by 2030" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-177184"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Keir Starmer hopes to bring an end to HIV transmissions by 2030&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (POOL/AFP via Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne Aslett, chief executive of The Elton John Aids Foundation, welcomed the plan, particularly the increased funding for opt-out testing, a model her organisation pioneered in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She noted: "The latest results speak volumes, over 90% of people newly diagnosed in emergency departments had never been tested for HIV before. Smart, targeted investment like this saves lives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Aslett also praised the £9 million investment in retaining the estimated 12,000 people living with HIV currently out of care, calling it "crucial for keeping people healthy and stopping onward transmission." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she cautioned: "But without bold investment in prevention, including making PrEP widely accessible to everyone who needs it, ending new infections will remain out of reach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Streeting concluded: "Thanks to the work of determined campaigners across our country, ending new HIV transmissions by 2030 – a history making, world changing goal – is within reach. This government will now put its shoulder to the wheel to deliver this change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNaUY0a3BYbHVCVXdVWmlJYVF4ZzhlbWQ2NGJYVExMc2Q4Nmd0V3RxTFFKM2tVb2daWmVuUGtWVHVGMV91UTVQbFBlUjRudTdBQ2JNUW5GQWhKOUNoSjQ1LV9vOGpmMElyWUcybGhsLTdRbnNIRFB1OXRmU1IzdFB5MWhOQmh0ZDZZRnJmR0NvYXVHTXp0MXdPVVBmZnliWk1tUmpGYWhR</guid></item><item><title>健康编辑与年轻人疾病激增的癌症斗争-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15310871/health-editor-cancer-surge-young-people-signs.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The panic hit first. Then came the embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After all, I had spent years giving health advice to colleagues, friends and family, convinced I was an expert in so many areas of medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet there I was, at my desk as Health Editor at the Daily Mail in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_york/index.html" id="mol-454e28a0-c942-11f0-9d74-9506a24b12fb"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, being told that I had &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-4546d5a0-c942-11f0-9d74-9506a24b12fb"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was especially hard to take because being healthy had become so much a part of my identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I trained in martial arts, worked out religiously, tracked everything I ate and, if I'm honest, bragged constantly about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Friends came to me for health advice: &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Should I eat this? Will that give me cancer? What supplements do you take? How do I get abs?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, my unusual eating habits were a running office joke: six boiled eggs for lunch, yoghurt parfaits mixed in giant baking bowls, and my infamous popcorn that would stink out the newsroom every afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So getting diagnosed with cancer at 29, when I was seemingly in perfect health, felt not only deeply unfair, but a little like some kind of cosmic payback for being so confident in my own good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;To my utter shock, I was diagnosed with testicular cancer at 29 (author pictured)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A forced smile barely hides my nerves as I prepare for my first CT scans, which will reveal if the cancer has spread &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That said, however, the diagnosis didn't come entirely out of nowhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The day before, after putting it off for months, I'd finally had an ultrasound on an almond-sized lump in my left testicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scan was meant to take 30 minutes, but dragged on for an hour and a half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The technician muttered about 'poor visibility' and 'protocol' requiring clear images of every region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now I realize what was really happening: she was taking as many images as possible, knowing - or strongly suspecting - it was cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I didn't get out until 3pm, and assumed I'd hear back in a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the next morning, at 9.03am exactly, my phone lit up. Most offices open at 9am, I thought, so clearly this was urgent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I shot out of my chair and raced across the newsroom floor as the person on the phone told me to find a private room and turn my camera on. The doctor needed to speak to me urgently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I propped my phone up in front of me and sat awkwardly as the doctor connected and said, 'I'm so sorry - we're fairly confident you've got cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;I trained in martial arts (pictured in my uniform) and worked out multiple times a week - being fit and healthy had become part of my identity &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: I wear a sheepish look as I wait to hear what stage the cancer has reached&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As she delivered the hammer blow, I felt utterly numb. I was listening to every word, but they weren't registering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was as if she was describing someone else, maybe one of the hundreds of patients I'd written about, but not me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then she added, 'There's good news… and bad news.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bad news: they were confident it was cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the doctor told me that if you had to pick a cancer, this is one of the most treatable forms (which didn't feel very reassuring at the time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she was right. Testicular cancer has a five-year survival rate above 95 percent - and it doesn't take a health journalist to know how good that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The overall five-year survival rate for all cancers is roughly 69 percent, but many types which are increasingly common in young people are far deadlier, such as pancreatic (12 percent) and liver (21 percent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Testicular cancer is uniquely treatable for a few reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, the tumors are extraordinarily sensitive to chemotherapy, which can melt away cancer cells even if the disease has spread to other parts of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it usually strikes men in their 20s or 30s, whose bodies handle aggressive treatment well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In my mind I had prepared to do chemotherapy - after all, the doctor told me there was a 40 percent chance of the disease returning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: The joy on my face after learning the cancer was contained to the testicle and I didn't need to have chemo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Removing the testicle is also fairly straightforward - you're in and out of hospital in hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And because lumps appear early, surgeons often remove the entirety of the cancer, reducing the risk of spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, I was told I needed surgery immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After hanging up with my doctor, I was struck by a blizzard of emotions. Looking back, I now recognize it as 10 minutes of sheer panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My eyes filled with tears as visions flashed through my mind of the worst-case scenario: bald, weak, dying young, not fulfilling my ambitions or dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I tried calling my mom, who was at work, and Googled survival statistics, which calmed me a little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, strangely, something switched in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I became intensely practical, with absolute focus on the next appointment, scan or blood test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That focus lasted throughout my fight and I haven't been emotional about my cancer since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A lot of that is down to how efficient my treatment plan was. From diagnosis to surgery was less than two weeks - startlingly fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a Briton whose grandfather had to wait six months to start treatment for stage 3 prostate cancer on the National Health Service, the speed of American healthcare, despite its flaws, felt surreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The timing of the cancer was terrible - I'd been due to move apartments. Pictured: I was fresh out of surgery and unable to lift heavy items, so I recruited the help of friends to move a sofa into my new home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;When I visited my oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering - a surreal experience, given I'd spent years writing about the hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of course, it was reassuring to be treated so quickly. But the worst part of a cancer diagnosis is one that nobody talks about: when the doctor says 'you have cancer,' you still don't know your chance of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not until they figure out how big the tumor is, whether it has spread to nearby lymph nodes or organs and exactly what type of cancer it is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only then can doctors give an accurate picture of your outlook and the treatment you'll need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My blood tests came back the next day: no tumor markers. A feeling of shattering relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CT scans followed a few days later - chest, abdomen, pelvis - to see if it had spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was a testament to the speed of the US health system that, later that day, I received the results: negative again. Another hurdle cleared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only after surgery could they confirm whether it was stage 1 - easily treatable, no chemotherapy required. It was looking good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the negative blood tests, scans and size of the tumor, my doctors had been confident I had a single 'seminoma,' a slow-growing tumor that develops over years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, they found two tumors: one seminoma and one embryonal carcinoma - a far more aggressive type that can spread in weeks or months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: A post-surgery thumbs up. The moment I woke from the operation, my years-long back pain was gone. It never returned&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;When I go out, I now try to stick to a two-drink max rule. The 'alcohol guilt' after cancer has been one of many surprises post-diagnosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were also early signs cancer cells had started migrating toward the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tiny cells may have leaked into the blood which can, over time, raise the risk of growing new tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When I visited my oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering - a surreal experience, given I'd spent years writing about the hospital - he told me plainly that with this combination, I had about a 40 percent chance of the cancer returning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To my surprise, despite the risk, my doctors advised against chemotherapy, even though it would reduce the risk to just one to three percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As they told me, doctors are now rethinking the old blanket-chemo approach because the treatment is brutal - hospitalizations, infections, sepsis, even a small risk of secondary cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For young, otherwise healthy patients, they said it was sometimes worth playing the odds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I was skeptical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was tempting to just get it over with, to never have to worry about the cancer again, and I'd mentally prepared myself for chemo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I sought a second opinion at Mount Sinai. To my surprise, the oncologist there also recommended surveillance only. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With two of the world's top cancer doctors in agreement, I felt I needed to be humble and listen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And as vain as it sounds, what unsettled me most was the thought of losing my hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The chemotherapy used for testicular cancer almost guarantees hair loss - even eyebrows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's a brutal prospect, though many would feel it's a price worth paying for survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;I am now closely monitored with blood tests, scans and X-rays every few months. If the cancer returns, I'll need chemo. Pictured: Me at my latest checkup in November 2025 (left) and returning to work in September 2025 (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;My mindset is: If it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone. I now urge all my male friends to check for lumps regularly and stay vigilant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So what's the next step?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I am now closely monitored with blood tests, scans and X-rays every few months. If it returns, I'll need chemo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cancer also affected my hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My testosterone crashed to the level of a 70-year-old, causing overwhelming fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I now inject medication three times a week and feel stronger all the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After two months off training, I'm back to working out five times per week, including three martial arts sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While I'm eating the same, something curious has happened with my weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I've shot up more than 10lbs in three months without gaining much, if any, new fat - almost certainly the result of my testosterone bouncing back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I now drink far less alcohol, and when I do, I stick to a two-drink maximum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the more surprising psychological changes is the guilt I feel after drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Knowing alcohol is a class 1 carcinogen - and that I'm in a critical period where my cancer could return - it just feels reckless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By reading this, you know I haven't kept my cancer a secret. I decided long ago I wanted to be an advocate. My mindset is: If it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I now urge all my male friends to check their testicles regularly and stay vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Curiously, my weight has shot up 10lbs since returning to work and exercise - almost certainly a result of my testosterone bouncing back &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: On vacation in October 2025, trying to reclaim what I can of the summer I missed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I mentioned embarrassment I felt when I received the diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Well, the second wave of it hit when I realized my symptoms had been there all along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two major health issues I'd battled for years - excruciating back pain and chronic fatigue - were almost certainly caused by the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For two years, I'd suffered pain I attributed to slipped discs and jiu-jitsu. On surgery morning, I could barely walk, yet the moment I woke from surgery, the pain was gone. It never returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors now think the tumor caused inflammation that radiated through my pelvis, irritating the nerves around my discs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I also spent years chronically exhausted, no matter how much I slept. I blamed the move to America, stress and long hours, despite fatigue being one of the most common symptoms of cancer that shows itself before a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet I, the person leading the Daily Mail's coverage of cancers in young people, had somehow missed my own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I initially thought my body had failed me, but perhaps it was my mind that had failed to listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Testicular cancer appears to be one of those genetic lottery diseases - I was probably born with a defect in the cells that form the testicles, called germ cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These are the cells that eventually develop into sperm, but if they go awry during development, they can later turn cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We still don't fully understand what sparks the cancerous change, but we know testicular cancer is rising among young men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies show its incidence has nearly doubled in the past 40 years in American men aged 20 to 34. It is now the most common form of cancer for men under 35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, I urge anyone who notices anything unusual, no matter how small, to get it checked. It could save your life - I'm hoping it's saved mine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
