    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He continued: 'It goes against Big Pharma and it goes against traditional medicine. It is a tragedy because these are very effective therapies that can really improve the patient's outcome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marik, however, did not discourage standard treatments and said 'some of these [treatments] can be used in conjunction with standard chemotherapy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A month's worth of vitamin D supplements, depending on the dosage, can range from around $5 to $25 while omega-3 capsules cost about $20 to $40. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin D is also naturally found in fatty fish like salmon and sardines, egg yolks, and fortified dairy, while fatty fish, edadame, and nuts all contain omega-3s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other hand, a month's worth of chemotherapy drugs can range dramatically in price - from $1,000 to more than $12,000, depending on the type and insurance coverage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, once someone is diagnosed with cancer, there is little evidence that supplements alone can help and traditional pharmaceutical therapies are lifesaving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the US oncology market reached $145.5 billion last year and is projected for a significant increase to $417 billion by 2034. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Factors such as a rising prevalence of cancer, advancements in precision medicine and increased demand for targeted therapies and immunotherapies are expected to boost the market in the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;American pharmaceutical company Merck &amp;amp; Co.'s earned about $64.2 billion last year - majorly through sales of chemotherapy drug Keytruda&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Analysis of blood samples revealed that during this time, omega-3 consumption 'turned back the clock' on biological age by up to four months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;American pharmaceutical company Merck &amp;amp; Co.'s earned about $64.2 billion - majorly through sales of Keytruda, a chemotherapy treatment for various cancers like melanoma, lung cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their oncology division made about $2 billion in sales last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Pfizer brought in $64 billion last year which included sales of Xtandi - an oral medication used to treat certain types of advanced prostate cancer. Overall, their oncology department earned about $25 billion in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Established giants such as Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson also made about $88 billion in 2024 - mostly from sales of its multiple myeloma treatment Darzalex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The company's oncology sector generated $21 billion in revenue last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the University of Zurich study, published in Frontiers in Aging, found that it is possible to keep cancer from developing in the first place with simple lifestyle changes and avoid needing to spend thousands of dollars on medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers from Zurich recruited 777 participants 70 years and older and split them into &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14354861/Researchers-supplement-slow-ageing-dementia-omega-3.html"&gt;different treatment groups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some took a vitamin D tablet per day, some took a 1g tablet of omega-3 per day, some participated in a 30-minute home exercise program three times a week, and some did a combination over the course of three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fatty acids and omega-3 molecules in fish can reduce inflammation in the body help maintain blood vessels &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analysis of blood samples revealed that during this time, omega-3 consumption 'turned back the clock' on biological age by up to four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Heike Bischoff-Ferrari, one of the study's authors, said at the time: 'This is the first randomized controlled trial to show that the combination daily vitamin D3, supplemental marine omega-3s, and a simple home exercise program may be effective in the prevention of invasive cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our results, although based on multiple comparisons and requiring replication, may prove to be beneficial for reducing the burden of cancer.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Combining omega-3, a vitamin D supplement and exercise was found to have a slightly stronger effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also found these three interventions together had the biggest impact on lowering cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Bischoff-Ferrari added: 'One of the most critical questions in the field of rejuvenation is whether a treatment exists that can effectively rejuvenate humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Given the well-documented health benefits of omega-3, we explored whether it also influences the most reliable molecular markers of biological age – epigenetic clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Slowing biological aging even to a small extent of three to four months across three years – as we saw in our study – is a good thing as, if sustained, it may have relevant effects on population health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In the same trial, omega-3 reduced falls by 11 percent and infections by 13 percent, and in combination with vitamin D and exercise it reduced cancer risk by 61 percent and frailty by 39 percent.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Professor Heike Bischoff-Ferrari, one of the 2022 study's authors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Paul Marik, a controversial physician who had his medical certification revoked for promoting ivermectin as a treatment for long Covid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists noted that Vitamin D absorbed into the body through sunlight and supplements can help stave off tumors by regulating several genes that are responsible for cell reproduction and division - preventing the rapid multiplication of cancerous cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, the researchers theorized that high levels omega-3, found mostly in fish and nuts, as well as exercise can suppress inflammation, malignant cell reproduction and angiogenesis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Angiogenesis is a process by which new blood vessels form from existing ones is crucial for tumor growth and spread because it allows tumors to access oxygen and nutrients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Inflammation may trigger cancer by damaging DNA, past studies have noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The inflammatory process produces molecules called cytokines, which stimulate the growth of blood vessels that 'feed' tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, fatty acids and omega-3 molecules can reduce inflammation in the body and help maintain blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 03:36:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNdWJWSExiTDhob1k2ZjYyanh4X3FRMUg5NU9QbTdySGgyV19Ka3BGWkVwOXQwMVhlWnJhcGpCRE5nd21DUDZ4dzRQRTV4VFUzcDVXdG5taFZXMzF5dkQtY2FTVG1EYUtsT0NDSGxSdmVlQmIwekRGRlMtbG5hZEpTYndQclNjRkFWOU9wR0pJNVhWZ0ZpSktJcnNTMjZxNDR30gGmAUFVX3lxTFB0OUtrT2JDVklHallDcFlpcWxhMjhJUFZSNGxYV3ZDTlQ5aUswVDhnS3NtdWM0MmY2TGhuS0VQSVhQMHRZaFB2MmVqamRWS05FdGVTUnpZMmhSMXVGLURNa2dfM1BHY0hfamlQMm14WXN4R3lRQ0NGYXRLNFFQcnpvRW9IdHhHZENQSG8taGtkZXpNWGdNU1FndEtrNzRFWXhCTEJlWUE</guid></item><item><title>US Woman Experiences Periods For Over 1000 Days, Doctors Baffled By Bizarre Condition - NDTV</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFBVV95cUxOcXcweklKMzVwSWtpdFhTZE1XWGU3dUNOcWsxdU1DOEVXVl9SYjZQdGlDdDBnTUtGTlQzUzJvcHpnV0xjRlNSbEhjUUpNNmd0N2pGU1hiT0NTX3B3Qkh3VFI0QnRkVFU1SFBKdERhMWlHUzBIdzVxakhxUDhRbU5vS1RtWlZDVzN1Z2hibE85end5X3U5dmpZZUVwNW8wSVh3clAweW0wYWNRa2hxNHAtODlUTmp2TGZzX25FQ2dR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="Art-exp_wr" id="ignorediv"&gt;
                                        
                                        &lt;p&gt;A TikTok user is sharing her harrowing experience with an unusually prolonged menstrual cycle that has lasted over 1,000 days. Despite consulting doctors, the cause of her condition remained a mystery until recently, when she finally discovered the underlying reason. "It was picked up on the very first ultrasound I had, and no one thought to mention it to me," Poppy revealed in a recent video.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menstrual cycles typically follow a predictable pattern, but variations are common. For most women, menstrual bleeding occurs every 21 to 35 days and lasts between 2 to 7 days. However, this timeline can vary depending on factors such as age, hormones, birth control, and lifestyle factors like stress, diet, and exercise. According to the &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/abnormal-uterine-bleeding?utm_source=redirect&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=otn"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt;, 14% to 25% of US women of childbearing age experience irregular periods, characterised by irregular cycle length, flow, or frequency. While this is usually not a major concern, if irregular periods become persistent or are accompanied by symptoms like pelvic pain or heavy bleeding, it's best to consult a doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="v-ndtv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poppy's three-year period saga began with two weeks of continuous bleeding, prompting medical attention. Despite multiple doctor consultations, tests, and medication, the bleeding persisted. Cysts were discovered on her ovaries, but the cause remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My iron levels? Rock bottom. The cramps? Awful. All of my muscles hurt, my bones hurt. I have constant headaches, constant nausea," Poppy said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poppy's periods persisted for three months, despite a PCOS diagnosis. Doctors performed a hysteroscopy, but found no clear cause. A specialist prescribed new medication and inserted an IUD, which also failed to provide relief. Her frustration and desperation grew as she struggled with persistent bleeding for over a year, despite undergoing numerous tests and trying various treatments and medications. Even an MRI and ultrasound showed no underlying issues. The cycle of hope and disappointment took a toll on her mental health, plunging her into depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her breakthrough came on day 950 of her prolonged bleeding, when she discovered a possible cause with the help of her TikTok followers. She revealed that she has a rare condition called a bicornuate uterus, also known as a heart-shaped uterus, where the uterus is divided into two chambers instead of one. Interestingly, this detail was initially noted on her first ultrasound around the third or fourth month of bleeding, but its significance wasn't realised until much later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bicornuate uterus, a rare condition affecting less than 5% of women, can cause severe symptoms such as heavy and prolonged bleeding, painful periods, and pelvic discomfort. While many women with this condition remain asymptomatic, for those who experience symptoms, the impact can be significant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have spent 950 days in absolute agony, spending my lifetime f—king savings on period pads and period products, on new trousers, on new underwear, on new sheets. I have cried every single day," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find relief, Poppy is planning to undergo several procedures. She will have a comprehensive hormonal panel to test her hormone levels and have her IUD removed. She is also scheduled for a dilation and curettage procedure, where doctors will scrape away abnormal tissue from her uterine lining. Furthermore, she is exploring surgery with her doctor to correct her heart-shaped uterus, a condition that may be the root cause of her symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thinking about a life where I'm not going to be bleeding every single day is heaven," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                                                                                
                                                                                
                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                    &lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr., the nation’s health secretary, recommended the measles vaccine and said he was “not familiar” with sweeping cuts to state and local public health programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The conversation was taped shortly after his visit to West Texas, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/health/measles-death-texas.html" title=""&gt;where he attended the funeral&lt;/a&gt; of an 8-year-old girl who died after contracting measles. A raging outbreak there has sickened more than 500 people and killed two young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In clips of the discussion released Wednesday, Mr. Kennedy offered one of his strongest endorsements yet of the measles vaccine. “People should get the measles vaccine, but the government should not be mandating those,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A few moments later, however, he raised safety concerns about the shot, as he has previously: “We don’t know the risks of many of these products because they’re not safety tested,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;For months, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/health/measles-vaccination-texas-kennedy.html" title=""&gt;Mr. Kennedy has faced intense criticism&lt;/a&gt; for his handling of the West Texas outbreak from medical experts who believe that his failure to offer a full-throated endorsement of immunization has hampered efforts to contain the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Moreover, he has promoted unproven treatments for measles, like cod liver oil. Doctors in Texas believe its use is tied to signs &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/health/measles-kennedy-vitamin-a.html" title=""&gt;of liver toxicity&lt;/a&gt; in some children arriving in local hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Throughout the outbreak, Mr. Kennedy has often paired support for vaccines with discussions of safety concerns about the shots, along with “miraculous” alternative treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Over the weekend, he posted on social media that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine was “the most effective way” to prevent the spread of measles — a statement met with relief from infectious disease experts and with fury from his vaccine-hesitant base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;That night, he posted again, this time applauding “two extraordinary healers” who he claimed had effectively treated roughly 300 measles-stricken children with budesonide, a steroid, and clarithromycin, an antibiotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-3"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Scientists say there are no cures for a measles infection, and that claiming otherwise undermines the importance of a vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Later in the CBS interview, Mr. Kennedy was pressed on the administration’s recent move &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/health/trump-state-health-grants-cuts.html" title=""&gt;to halt more than $12 billion&lt;/a&gt; in federal grants to state programs that address infectious disease, mental health and childhood vaccinations, among other efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;(&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/us/politics/hhs-public-health-grants-judge.html" title=""&gt;A judge has temporarily blocked the cuts&lt;/a&gt; after a coalition of states sued the Trump administration.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Kennedy said he wasn’t familiar with the interruptions, then asserted that they were “mainly D.E.I. cuts,” referring &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/dei-diversity-equity-inclusion" title=""&gt;to diversity, equity and inclusion programs that have been targeted&lt;/a&gt; by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Dr. Jonathan LaPook, CBS’s medical correspondent, asked about specific research cuts at universities, including a $750,000 grant to researchers at the University of Michigan to study adolescent diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I didn’t know that, and that’s something that we’ll look at,” Mr. Kennedy said. “There’s a number of studies that were cut that came to our attention and that did not deserve to be cut, and we reinstated them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2025 00:46:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNbmZSaC1LMTBKaWU5NThhZDk3MlBOcUtxRG1aeGpoMWdYNkRCUXJzcV9YVlVXMEMzSDNKa1lQaG5FZFZBaWU4ZFh0dE9SQ2gwT1I0RjlVTTVGclY1a0tyTjZQVkVLMFcxT0hiQUFRS2UxdUdFV1BmaURyX1ctMm5DY3J6YmJoa1dKZVJ6ZnNmcWstV19WNnRFNVhjS2hIUV9qLWcwUm13</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. praises measles response in Texas, US by making comparison to Europe - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOQ3l4QnVOdGFUTjZBRlhHMlhGUTZDMmtGOFNXUUlKbjFpNmJvOEJKbDBaSW1ubXBqX3hRRkZBaGZsZFVRbVJDYTFUUEF6UVZSclVISDNwSzFhdE9yT29jSEZXSUp4MDZYYkFadXVwVnFkYUtwNVJmWE1lZUZRTjJjNm9icmZtNHBjZ1FYVHV5cDBLR0U2RmwwdkZrZWPSAaIBQVVfeXFMTmFtS0pROHRnVU9fZXk1V3N1RDJDY2IwcXVCelREQnY4YkRTTnhwZ1BNLTVEc3RXOVdNenR6cTIwVlpuTzloUnlsanpTUkRYT2hZV3l4aHNMZzJFcVR5TDNta2ZCYWFPc3AxZ3hRMjdvQzJHbGdWdkhyY2htcHlQMkZuckR1czNlenlGZ29sY2dIMTl3SDB6SlVGY1ZTNXJaQk5R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;On Tuesday at a press conference, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Most notably, they had a 133% higher chance to develop a brain lesion than non-drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk wasn't isolated to the heavy drinkers alone, however, as former heavy drinkers still had an 89% higher risk, while moderate drinkers had a 60% higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think these are compelling results that link heavy alcohol consumption with lasting impacts on the brain," said Dr. Leana Wen, &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;'s wellness expert, previous Baltimore health commissioner, and emergency physician. "It’s especially telling that former heavy drinkers have evidence of sustained damage, although halting that heavy drinking does appear to lower risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the alarming discovery, Wen said that the severity of the study should still be taken in proportion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are caveats to this study," Wen said. "It is important to point out that these findings are associations that are suggestive, rather than proof of cause and effect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WKRC</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 23:11:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi5wJBVV95cUxNeWlwVHFuOWZNeC1ZbjY5clE2QnpHYzk5OWM0LTlONTNzQXh3ZmxUMmxXM2FrcWNsQm4zbHJuRFN1N3ZPUktPTlBtcE5wM1FvMlNXZWljU1dQVHlJOHF2Vy1obHpNaHVZY1FRbnJZLVIyaWxKazRrajhRYUxSUmx1ZGpuMmxvbDhRR1VRemEyZWR6UDhnY1lCOVdFNU16VzlSVHdwQVhoZ3NUdmQxb0RlYzVMSE9QMW5RS3Y1ZGVkMDBCQ3FPX2owbHpGRzRGZlZib0tHeDRLUGRUVXc4bnZMMmM1STlrdEJmcWVSa2M1S2ZOaDF1Y1hkN0w1bXNqdl9HaUtzTGtFY0k2aUtQelpVbUc4Vnl0Ym42X0tvbVVvSUt6dXRqOFozYnFpNnJTUmtBdlhHMV9iTHdrX0JVVmRiZHllY0xTYkh3QW1aT1dUUG90alFhOHl6UDJuQkh4bW9kTl9aVmJqdw</guid></item><item><title>Dad’s Alzheimer’s May Raise Tau Levels in Your Brain - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1kVjU4bGhKX0lhMVNGUkYtYTlVNUlvc2ZkNU8yZndob2VFWFpNam42QVBCVER4eTV0YUNCb19JaVRYcnlGai0xcTN4VVVWNjJ5Y0dsdHlheFRzSjZvc3l3b1BhaHU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research reveals that people with a father who had Alzheimer’s may be more vulnerable to the spread of tau protein in the brain, a hallmark of the disease. The study followed 243 individuals with a family history of Alzheimer’s over nearly seven years and found that those with affected fathers, especially women, showed greater tau buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, this contradicts previous assumptions that maternal inheritance posed higher risk. These findings may help inform future strategies for personalized prevention and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paternal Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Having a father with Alzheimer’s is associated with greater tau protein spread in the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex Difference:&lt;/strong&gt; Female participants showed more extensive tau buildup than males.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Signs:&lt;/strong&gt; 71 participants developed mild cognitive impairment during the study, a precursor to Alzheimer’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While some studies have suggested that having a mother with Alzheimer’s disease may put you more at risk of developing the disease, a new study finds that having a father with the disease may be tied to a greater spread of the tau protein in the brain that is a sign of the disease, according to a study published on April 9, 2025, online in &lt;em&gt;Neurology.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study does not prove that having a father with Alzheimer’s results in these brain changes; it only shows an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108553"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older man and his son." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dad-Alzheimers-Tau-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;During that time, 71 people developed mild cognitive impairment, which is a precursor to Alzheimer’s disease. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that female participants may be more at risk of a heavier buildup of tau protein than male participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to see that people with a father with Alzheimer’s were more vulnerable to the spread of tau in the brain, as we had hypothesized that we would see more brain changes in people with affected mothers,” said study author Sylvia Villeneuve, PhD, of McGill University in Montreal, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study looked at 243 people who had a family history of Alzheimer’s disease but had no thinking or memory problems themselves at the average age of 68. Family history was defined as one or both parents with the disease or at least two siblings with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants had brain scans and took tests of thinking and memory skills at the start of the study and then during the study as they were followed for an average of nearly seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that time, 71 people developed mild cognitive impairment, which is a precursor to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that people with a father with Alzheimer’s disease as well as female participants had a greater spread of tau protein in the brain. Female participants also had a heavier buildup of tau protein in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Better understanding these vulnerabilities could help us design personalized interventions to help protect against Alzheimer’s disease,” Villeneuve said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study is that white people made up the majority of participants, so the results may not apply to other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Quebec Research Fund – Health, J.-Louis Lévesque Foundation, Brain Canada Foundation, Alzheimer’s Society Canada and Brain Canada Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#553b363a3b2734311534343b7b363a38" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Natalie Conrad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Natalie Conrad – AAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 21:57:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1kVjU4bGhKX0lhMVNGUkYtYTlVNUlvc2ZkNU8yZndob2VFWFpNam42QVBCVER4eTV0YUNCb19JaVRYcnlGai0xcTN4VVVWNjJ5Y0dsdHlheFRzSjZvc3l3b1BhaHU</guid></item><item><title>Illinois unveils online tool showing measles vaccination rates by school - Chicago Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxOVk1SaDFWVldHN3lJR0RsZmhXWHNxVnRMX1ZLbThWc1pyR0d0RkFCS2V3dHRFa3FzRFBjT2ZNa0UtWmlfbTZkOHVkdE5aZDlkVlU3QjdJZkpSRW4xWU9SSllaX3hvcExWcmJCa2JRR2Z1aWZYTXFwZm5vajVFT1lQTmhSdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With measles spreading across the country, the Illinois Department of Public Health unveiled a &lt;a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/prevention-wellness/immunization/coverage-dashboards/measles-outbreak-simulator-dashboard.html"&gt;new online tool&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that allows people to look up measles vaccination rates and data about the risk of outbreaks at individual schools across the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illinois has not had any reported cases of measles yet this year, but there were 607 reported cases across the country so far this year, as of April 3, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;Texas announced&lt;/a&gt; that a second child with measles had died. In all, three people with measles in the U.S. have died this year, and all three were unvaccinated. Before the recent outbreak, there had not been a measles death in the U.S. for a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our new dashboard provides the public with the ability to review the measles vaccination rates in their child’s school and its risk for an outbreak,” said Dr. Sameer Vohra, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/prevention-wellness/immunization/coverage-dashboards/measles-outbreak-simulator-dashboard.html"&gt;Measles Outbreak Simulator Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; uses school vaccination data from 2023-2024 to predict, project and estimate the size and spread of a measles outbreak in individual Illinois schools. People looking up schools in Cook County should look under “Suburban-Cook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state health department is encouraging school administrators and staff to use the dashboard to help make decisions related to outbreak prevention and control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vohra urged Illinois residents to make sure they and their family members are up-to-date on their measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the vaccine are recommended for lifetime protection and are 97% effective against measles, according to the CDC. One dose is 93% effective against the illness. The first dose of the vaccine, or the similar measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox) vaccine is typically is given at age 12 months to 15 months. Children typically receive the second dose between ages 4 to 6.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;more than 20 states&lt;/a&gt; have reported confirmed cases of measles, with the largest outbreak in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neighboring Indiana said Wednesday it has &lt;a href="https://events.in.gov/event/idoh-news-release-indiana-department-of-health-confirms-5-new-measles-cases?utm_campaign=widget&amp;amp;utm_medium=widget&amp;amp;utm_source=State+of+Indiana"&gt;confirmed six cases of measles&lt;/a&gt;, including four minors who were unvaccinated and two adults whose vaccination status was unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vohra said the state health department is working with local public health departments and health care organizations to “prepare for any potential measles cases in Illinois.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illinois has not had a case of measles since an &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/05/30/citys-public-health-department-declares-measle-outbreak-over-according-to-report/"&gt;outbreak in March 2024&lt;/a&gt; in which 67 cases were reported, with most linked to a Chicago shelter for migrants on the Lower West Side where nearly 2,500 people were living in close quarters. That outbreak was the largest in Illinois since 1990, according to the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can check their vaccination status by contacting their health care providers or looking at their medical records. Or they can use the Illinois Department of Public Health’s online portal, &lt;a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/vaxverify.html?utm_source=sfmc&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=CDPH+Encourages+Measles+Vaccination&amp;amp;utm_term=https%3a%2f%2fdph.illinois.gov%2fvaxverify.html&amp;amp;utm_id=1333387&amp;amp;sfmc_id=128588093"&gt;Vax Verify&lt;/a&gt;, to check their immunization status.&lt;/p&gt;

Men in the top 10% of scores were invited for further investigations.

Using functional MRI scans, scientists observed disruptions in the frontal-limbic system and cerebellar cortex, regions involved in executive function and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes intensified and expanded as treatment progressed, suggesting a cumulative impact on brain function. The findings may help explain the cognitive difficulties often experienced during and after chemotherapy, commonly known as “chemo brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Brain Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; Chemotherapy quickly alters brain connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affected Regions:&lt;/strong&gt; Disruptions were found in areas linked to memory and decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progressive Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Connectivity changes worsened and spread over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Wiley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New research published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging&lt;/em&gt; has uncovered changes in brain connectivity during chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study of 55 patients with breast cancer and 38 controls without cancer, investigators conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging scans of participants’ brains over several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108549"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two heads and brains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/chemo-brain-connectivity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These changes got worse and spread more as chemotherapy continued.

Two matched female healthy control (HCs, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 20 and &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 18) groups received the same assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jmri29772-sec-0005-title"&gt;Field Strength/Sequence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;rs-fMRI (gradient-echo EPI) and 3D T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence at 3.0 T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jmri29772-sec-0006-title"&gt;Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain functional networks were analyzed using graph theory approaches. We analyzed changes in brain connectome metrics and explored the relationship between these changes and clinical scales (including emotion and cognitive test).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients were divided into subgroups according to clinical classification, chemotherapy regimen, and menopausal status.

These abnormalities expanded with chemotherapy progression significantly (TP2 vs. TP3). T&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;opological parameters changes were also correlated with clinical scales changes significantly. No differences were found within or between HC groups (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.490–0.989) or BC subgroups (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.053–0.988) at TP1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jmri29772-sec-0009-title"&gt;Data Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAC affects the brain functional connectome of BC patients at TP2, and these changes persist and further intensify at TP3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jmri29772-sec-0110-title"&gt;Level of Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="jmri29772-sec-0111-title"&gt;Technical Efficacy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 5.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 21:04:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1ndG1rbThUU0FEeHBGSnF1aTY2UkY4NXljcjFXRWZWa0hoa1hHT3NkallVLW8zT2RHejZ0NS1NTHN2M0ozR1RmblUtZ0ttbTdQb0syeFdaenIzcHBNREJZODYyYzZ2anFOWHRFNkMtT1VLb1ZYVHc</guid></item><item><title>Five new measles cases confirmed in Indiana - WSBT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixAFBVV95cUxPOXpLMjYzbUZoMl9JY3BMMUV4MkxkQzJ5eDRfZE9JdDA4TjJ4ZWNfelBycGVJR3hXRWVPOU80Rmt4SWw5MzZ6WmxPSG1NUEt2UTQxTlhib1JVX1lfWTZUZmZFMVhKSHJlUVVNUTNqNF9tMHMtOVVodHFrcS1VS3BLNmJ2MHZ6ZTFwaEhEVldCY3VEUndLVmdKRW1HR3JXa1loazZrV0VfT0hKQlRCVXZmdmRxdFpfUU1oVGpKc1lrblpQcGRt?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="index-module_storyColumn__EZ7G" id="js-Story-Content-0"&gt;&lt;p class="StoryTags-module_tagWrapperLine__Jfav"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;ALLEN COUNTY, Ind.

Scientists found that serotonin neurons encode a “prospective code for value,” signaling expectations about upcoming outcomes and how rapidly those expectations are changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This helps the brain assess the value of possible actions in shifting environments, guiding everyday decision-making. The findings challenge long-held assumptions about serotonin and offer a unifying theory relevant to neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry, and AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Forecasting:&lt;/strong&gt; Serotonin neurons encode expectations about upcoming rewards and punishments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; These neurons respond to surprise, pain, and pleasure—depending on expected value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain vs. Machine:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain’s value-signaling system via serotonin differs significantly from artificial systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In our day-to-day lives, we’re constantly making a slew of decisions from immediate matters to prospects on the far horizon. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the evolutionary nuts-and-bolts of how our brains weigh these numerous daily decisions and what role is played by the neurotransmitter serotonin has been shrouded in mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108545"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-reward-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While the overall picture was extremely puzzling, he says it was then they realized they might be chasing something promising. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study led by an interdisciplinary University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine team delivers fascinating findings on this big topic and potentially unravels a hidden aspect of what our nervous system’s extraordinarily complex serotonin system is really doing inside the enigmatic organ in our skulls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, this study from a highly impactful international collaboration was considered by one of the expert reviewers who evaluated the work to offer “broad implications across neuroscience, psychology, and psychiatry, enhancing our understanding of serotonin’s role in mood regulation, learning, and motivated behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s innovative work merges ideas from reinforcement learning (RL) theory – used in neuroscience to better understand learning, behavior, and decision-making – with recent hard-won insights into the filtering properties of the brain’s dorsal raphe nucleus. That’s a region of the mammalian brainstem rich in serotonin-producing neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serotonin is often painted as the brain’s “pleasure chemical.” Antidepressant drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) famously target the serotonin system as part of a multi-billion-dollar industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, serotonin’s precise role in the nervous system is ambiguous and perplexing: It’s implicated in everything from mood and movement regulation to appetite and sleep-wake cycles. The fact that it’s activated by pain, pleasure and surprise has long been a brain research puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this study, the uOttawa-led researchers put forth a unifying perspective on serotonin they dub a “prospective code for value” – a biological code for how the brain places a value for future rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This code essentially explains why serotonin neurons are activated in the brain in response to both rewards and punishments, with a preference for surprising rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work asks the question: What does serotonin tell the brain? In a nutshell, we find that its message closely matches the expectation of future rewards,” says senior author Dr. Richard Naud, associate professor at the Faculty of Medicine’s Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicineand the uOttawa Department of Physics&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-author Dr. Jean-Claude Béïque, professor in the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, puts the main findings like this: “Your brain needs to compute the expected value of the actions you contemplate and undertake as you interact with a changing world, asking ‘What’s the value of this decision versus that decision in that particular environment?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s a hard problem. So what we think serotonin actually does in the brain is encode the expected value of a particular environment or course of actions in order to ultimately guide everyday decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drs. Béïque and Naud are both members of the uOttawa Brain and Mind Research Institute’s Centre for Neural Dynamics and Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Initial Spark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The germ of the idea began years ago at the uOttawa Faculty of Medicine when first author Emerson Harkin&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; then a PhD student in Dr. Naud’s lab, started to simulate reinforcement-learning models while working on the biophysical properties of serotonin neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Harkin, who finished his PhD work at uOttawa in late 2023 and was awarded his degree in March 2024, says the core idea came “half-serendipitously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After investing a lot of time and effort studying the electrical properties of the brain cells that produce serotonin, he and his uOttawa Faculty of Medicine supervisors started looking closely at findings from other labs that focused on measuring the activity of serotonin neurons in animals experiencing rewards and punishments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the overall picture was extremely puzzling, he says it was then they realized they might be chasing something promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nobody seemed to have considered the possibility that serotonin neurons might be activated by &lt;em&gt;changes&lt;/em&gt; in the animal’s surroundings, like the start of a signal that reward will arrive soon or the end of a punishment,” says Dr. Harkin, referring to lab experiments with mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we looked at these previous results through the lens of what we had seen under our microscopes and with our electrodes, a lot of results that had previously seemed puzzling or contradictory suddenly started to fit together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now in Germany doing a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Dr. Harkin asserts that the findings show a big part of what the serotonin system does is send a “message to the rest of the brain saying: “Here’s our best guess about how good your near future will be, and here’s how quickly that guess is improving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Naud, a computational neuroscience expert who drilled down on the theory’s deeply complex math, explains the initial idea evolved quite a bit over the last couple of years as the collaborative team finetuned the work with “lots of reading, lots of discussion, lots of thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, the research team aims to study the role of serotonin on behavior to try and figure out what the rest of the brain does with the neurotransmitter’s messages. Dr. Naud says perhaps finding ways of employing reinforcement-learning theory on frameworks can help them do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Dr. Naud, whose neuroscience work often has implications for theories of learning and memory that can inform future developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), believes the team’s study just published in &lt;em&gt;Nature &lt;/em&gt;appears to show how special the nervous system really is&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a way I feel that the team’s findings show that the brain doesn’t work the way machines do. If we perturb the signaling of rewards in the machine it would do many things that the perturbation in brains don’t do,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6515090a020a110d0025100a11110412044b0604" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paul Logothetis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uottawa.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Paul Logothetis – University of Ottawa&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08731-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A prospective code for value in the serotonin system&lt;/a&gt;” by Richard Naud et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A prospective code for value in the serotonin system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The in vivo responses of dorsal raphe nucleus serotonin neurons to emotionally salient stimuli are a puzzle. Existing theories centring on reward, surprise, salience and uncertainty individually account for some aspects of serotonergic activity but not others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merging ideas from reinforcement learning theory with recent insights into the filtering properties of the dorsal raphe nucleus, here we find a unifying perspective in a prospective code for value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This biological code for near-future reward explains why serotonin neurons are activated by both rewards and punishments, and why these neurons are more strongly activated by surprising rewards but have no such surprise preference for punishments—observations that previous theories have failed to reconcile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, our model quantitatively predicts in vivo population activity better than previous theories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By reconciling previous theories and establishing a precise connection with reinforcement learning, our work represents an important step towards understanding the role of serotonin in learning and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 20:48:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9uQ3hySFpFYWxWUlpOSmlwOGpuaDc2TXRWeEQxNmhiM21RcG85cHRON0JLd2VvOGdlUTVTckVveHQ0SGczNkxFM0Q3dmlNLU1wMXBuenpVMDZ2OGxlaC1LTjNaYlN3NDZlRFVhVGZqT3c0cjQ</guid></item><item><title>Another state reports measles outbreak - OregonLive.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxQMlZ2V1BreVNTRzl0OHE4RGduMjU3SDZhcFJKaXVQOGhMQ2pfeFFIT2xqMndsdnBveXhaZWxfSGY1aEJkVmVVVHVFeG5mVGxBYm5vNFg1bjhOdzRxSEI3djVvZzJlR3k3bWV0RkVmNE5xZzJzWWk5R04tSkFhekt1VWNMRFJYWXRTTEN4b0pn0gGiAUFVX3lxTFBnekNuR3IxUWNqTVJTdUFpT1ZhUGZHY1JtZ2I1NVZXYXFWTHN6dThaaWk2cHkzY1N1R2JDWkxhYVBpVVl3RUJ6Wm9Ea0dwQ2Z3aUlmS0VaQ0V2TFRrVEhUbXp1Y081c1Ryc0l0eWFIMjJFVGZmQ0Fyb2d5c0g2Ty1wLWZLbnh6eXRxa0FJTHplYmRkNGVLV3Fsejc5bWRsUTJfdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4XSVRIHPGRGTNODN37PX5CYHRI"&gt;Indiana health officials announced a measles outbreak Wednesday, with six cases that have no known links to the outbreaks in several other states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QRZCHGXUTJDNJASDE6X3KA5ELI"&gt;The U.S. has more than double the number of measles cases it saw in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZET2XPAZTNEWRCVQBNAQQUSWGY"&gt;Texas is reporting the majority of them with 505.

His private comments, however, betray his &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/rfk-jr-poppers-hiv-prevention" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;conspiratorial leanings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the funeral for eight-year-old Daisy Hildebrand — the &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/06/measles-texas-outbreak-death-unvaccinated/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;second known child&lt;/a&gt; to die from measles complications in Texas, the heart of the outbreak — the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/08/texas-funeral-measles-vaccine-rfk-jr" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;girl's father told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the anti-vaxxer now running America's healthcare seemed to fall down on the job when he &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;came to pay his respects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He did not say that the vaccine was effective," Pete Hildebrand, the father of the unvaccinated girl, told the newspaper of the Health and Human Services secretary. "I had supper with the guy... and he never said anything about that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite his public change of heart regarding the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, it's not exactly shocking that Kennedy is privately talking out of both sides of his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after the outbreak of the previously-contained respiratory virus claimed its first life — an unvaccinated six-year-old Mennonite girl who, like Hildebrand, died in West Texas' Gaines County — the &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/rfk-jr-five-more-worms" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;brain-wormed political scion&lt;/a&gt; not only &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/rfk-jr-cod-liver-oil-measles" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;touted natural treatments&lt;/a&gt; over vaccination, but also suggested that immunity was better gained by simply &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/rfk-jr-suggests-getting-measles" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;allowing children to get the measles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It used to be, when you and I were kids, that everybody got measles. And the measles gave you lifetime protection against measles infection," &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Kennedy told &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt; host Sean Hannity&lt;/a&gt; during a March interview. "The vaccine doesn’t do that. The vaccine is effective for some people for life, but for many people it wanes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That claim, it's worth noting, is undercut by strong evidence that catching measles &lt;a href="https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(19)31728-7/fulltext" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;weakens a child's immune system&lt;/a&gt; so significantly that they may become more susceptible to getting sicker from &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; illnesses down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like with that first measles death, Kennedy once again sent mixed messages about measles prevention and treatment.

All underwent autopsies of their brains.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though binge drinking had the most detrimental effects, even drinking less alcohol was shown to have lasting consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Former heavy drinkers were found to have 89 percent higher odds of developing brain legions compared to teetotalers and moderate drinkers were at a 60 percent higher risk. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the findings, study author Alberto Fernando Oliveira Justo said: 'Heavy alcohol consumption is a major global health concern linked to increased health problems and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We looked at how alcohol affects the brain as people get older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our research shows that heavy alcohol consumption is damaging to the brain, which can lead to memory and thinking problems.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Justo said understanding these effects of alcohol is crucial for public health awareness and 'continuing to implement preventive measures to reduce heavy drinking.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/world-health-organization/index.html" id="mol-3b4db4e0-c936-11ef-83cb-3564571cc7ae" class=""&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; warns that no level of alcohol consumption is safe for health and it is one of the leading preventable causes of death in the US, behind tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol use contributes to nearly 100,000 cancer cases and about 20,000 deaths each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research over the past four decades has revealed a 'causal relationship' between alcohol use and increased risk for at least seven different types of cancer, including of the breast, colon, liver and throat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of how alcohol causes cancer, an advisory from the US Surgeon General Dr Vivek Murthy says there are 'four distinct ways' that it works inside the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, alcohol breaks down into acetaldehyde once it is consumed. Acetaldehyde is a substance that causes cancer by binding to DNA and damaging it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When DNA is damaged, a cell can begin to grow uncontrollably and create a cancerous tumor.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Second, alcohol generates 'reactive oxygen species, which increase inflammation and can damage DNA, proteins, and lipids in the body through a process called oxidation'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thirdly, alcohol alters hormone levels (including estrogen), which the experts say can play a role in the development of breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And lastly, carcinogens from other sources, especially particles of tobacco smoke, can dissolve in alcohol, making it easier for them to be absorbed into the body, increasing the risk for mouth and throat cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The current US Dietary Guidelines recommend that American men should consume no more than two alcoholic drinks a day and women should consume no more than one alcoholic beverage per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For decades, studies suggested that there was some benefit to drinking moderate amounts of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in recent years, research has swung the other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new Dietary Guidelines will be published in 2026 and it is believed that Americans could soon be urged &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12438233/Americans-limited-two-beers-strict-new-alcohol-guidelines-Bidens-booze-czar.html"&gt;to drink no more than two bottles of beer&lt;/a&gt; or glasses of wine per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The guidelines will eventually be signed off on by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 60million Americans report binge drinking at least once a year, and on average Americans who drink alcohol say they consume about drinks per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism reports that rates of binge drinking among people ages 18 to 25 are decreasing but remain high (28.7 percent in 2023). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health of full-time college students ages 18 to 22, 46.3 percent drank alcohol and 27.9 percent engaged in binge drinking in the past month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Justo's team noted that a limitation of their study was that it did not look at participants before death and they did not have information on the duration of alcohol consumption and a ranking of their cognitive abilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 20:10:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPR2luWlNqVlZXTTFBZmJOY0t5NHR6MWp6amJ0cFZhdExkVm16R3lsQVFWQlpLZkxrYUNNeUMyLUFyaUdtXzdTNGNoTVV3VWNMNTF4Q3RrNWgwRjFuMjVEQnBaUlZKSzFqVmdWMThPajhsWjE2OTNtLV9ucnpOdFh4d0Q3TXh1OV8yWmdVRGxvaWNyU3NEYmEtd0VB0gGfAUFVX3lxTE5DYVh2bGpVbXlxZFlLQ1NHU2tUUjZ4dERwcjVOMk5SUWtqd1VlSGRwSmJGemg2OUR5bllMSmdheC15RXFJYkl1eVB1cUF3czkzSVJwREl0RE9tZkVyUWxybzJiZ3FwbUpvbmFQWW40Q05oeno5ZERDaGo0ckRmcXBpVXhibTNoX1BlOWNYNUhiUEFyZkZoQVh2TXA1WXI3SQ</guid></item><item><title>Measles case confirmed in Montcalm County, 4th in Michigan - FOX 17 West Michigan News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNU3VmQ1hRNGh2MVY5T1BCQkVqcjFKV3I2WlYwckh6T2ItNXRtd3ZwaFVESVlmWGo2TUNlMmxUZkJIWWR5UUFWbnRNMkU1Y2Y2Ykd3cmdBTkRIQkl5dE9VdlQyQl9QNU9zNmFnU1J2Tmo2S3lsLTE3TGl6OC1UeXgySVlEc05HQW9lYUNCRF9SaFZGUFdfREJ5RHAtejFZdEVUdTBBS243VFFiUGNpYmtYY2JqSTZpcjhocG8w?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;MONTCALM COUNTY, Mich. — A fourth person in Michigan has a confirmed case of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis was announced Wednesday, April 9, for a person living in Montcalm County.

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is not immune to measles is at risk of contracting the disease through exposure to an infected individual. The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine provides protection for decades, according to the health department. The vaccine could also help fight an infection if the shot is received within 3 days of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infected people can spread the virus several days before symptoms appear, with the disease taking 1 to 3 weeks to affect a new person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes, white spots on cheeks, gums, and roof of the mouth, plus a rash that starts near the hairline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you believe you were exposed to or have measles, you are encouraged to contact your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fox17online.com/news/local-news/measles-outbreaks-bring-concerns-as-spring-breakers-come-home" class="ListItem " data-cms-ai="0"&gt;

The statement came after Kennedy attended the funeral of a third measles victim over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy’s response to the outbreak has been widely criticized by &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/third-measles-death" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;epidemiologists&lt;/a&gt; and public health experts, who argue he failed to give a full-throated endorsement of an extremely effective vaccine, that cases appear to be severely undercounted and that officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The numbers continue to grow by the day, but … the growth rate has diminished substantially,” Kennedy told reporters during a press conference, while promoting his health agenda through the American south-west.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Public health experts have said that, in fact, there is little evidence to support this claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I would compare it to what’s happening in Europe now,” Kennedy continued, according to &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-pulse/2025/04/09/states-race-to-offset-the-loss-of-obamacare-subsidies-00279443" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;. “They’ve had 127,000 cases and 37 deaths. And so, what we’re doing right here in the United States is a model for the rest of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy appeared to reference figures from the World Health Organization (WHO) released in &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/13-03-2025-european-region-reports-highest-number-of-measles-cases-in-more-than-25-years---unicef--who-europe" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;March&lt;/a&gt;. In that instance, global health officials were referring to cases across 53 countries in Europe and central Asia, which make up the WHO’s “European region”. Included in that tally are nations such as Romania and Kazakhstan, which together account for nearly 60,000 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Measles is the most contagious illness that we know of and it is preventable,” said Susan Polan, associate executive director of the American Public &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Association. “What we’re seeing now… is a far, far undercount in terms of the actual number of cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Before the current outbreak, the US had not had a measles death &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/10/vaccines-measles-outbreak-immune-system" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt;. Three people have now died as a result of the Texas outbreak, and &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;nearly 500&lt;/a&gt; people have gotten sick, according to Texas authorities. Because measles has an average death rate of one to three per 1,000, public health officials believe cases are undercounted. The measles vaccine is 97% effective at preventing the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;On Sunday, Kennedy said CDC staff would be &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;redeployed&lt;/a&gt; to the outbreak in Texas. This week, Kennedy also said the best way to prevent measles is to get the vaccine. However, he also used his attendance at a measles victim’s funeral to promote &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;unproven therapies for measles&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We should have had more people on the ground – this should have been a priority for weeks and weeks,” said Polan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in the US in 2000. However, anti-vaccine sentiment first stoked by a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/feb/02/lancet-retracts-mmr-paper" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fraudulent scientific paper&lt;/a&gt; in the Lancet and then by non-profits, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/18/instagram-facebook-suspend-robert-kennedy-jr-anti-vax" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;such as the one&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy led for nearly a decade, has stoked a dramatic increase in vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The decline in trust in vaccines has been especially precipitous among Republicans and Republican-leaning adults. A &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Gallup poll&lt;/a&gt; from August 2024 found the percentage of Republicans who believe it is extremely important to vaccinate children fell from more than 60% in the early 2000s to 26% in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As trust in vaccines wanes among Republicans, and Kennedy himself voices lackluster support, Kennedy has enjoyed &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/press-release/poll-trust-in-public-health-agencies-and-vaccines-falls-amid-republican-skepticism/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;high trust ratings&lt;/a&gt; among Republicans – nearly as high as Donald Trump himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy made the comments as the department he oversees, Health and Human Services, undergoes a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/hhs-cdc-fda-layoffs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;dramatic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/09/health-layoff-future-science-disease" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;largely opaque&lt;/a&gt; restructuring. A total of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/rfk-jr-health-department-cuts" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;20,000 positions&lt;/a&gt; have been eliminated between a cut of 10,000 made by Kennedy and an additional 10,000 employees cut by billionaire Elon Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The CDC lost &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restructuring-doge-fact-sheet.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2,400 employees&lt;/a&gt; in the restructuring. Overall, HHS will lose nearly a quarter of its workforce. Kennedy has also installed vaccine skeptics in important roles within the agency, including at least one who has &lt;a href="https://insights.citeline.com/pink-sheet/agency-leadership/us-fda/highly-problematic-acting-fda-commissioner-paused-planned-ok-of-novavax-shot-GUT6LR4X6ZALRMMZAEXYZHY36Y/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;paused approval&lt;/a&gt; of a Covid-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Further, basic research into &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/trump-vaccine-skeptics-research-funding" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; has been under threat during Kennedy’s tenure. Before he took office, he tried to force the federal government to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rescind authorization&lt;/a&gt; for Covid-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy’s statements also come as HHS has clawed back more than &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/rfk-hhs-layoffs-lawsuit" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$11bn&lt;/a&gt; in funding to local and state health departments – including grants that had funded &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-vaccines-children-weakening-system-hhs-budget-cuts-rcna199188" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;immunization clinics&lt;/a&gt; near the measles outbreak in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj01FQfJ1-Q" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy denied knowledge of the clawbacks, and said: “I’m not familiar with those cuts … The cuts were mainly [diversity, equity and inclusion] cuts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 19:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxQSmZPNzl4NW1MYzVRQnhHeHg0SUg1Wm9wbXR5Y1ZuXy0yU2dkeVhDRDNlRWM1MWVnaUVWSWJNVXFLSGtqZkJjSFNZMVNlMnMzVGNsS0NXTUQzV2NMdDRuX3oySjZJZ1NwbFFWRy1CV2pta3pmVWZpRjBLOUdEVko0OGpzbw</guid></item><item><title>MEASLES IN MONTCALM CO. | Michigan sees its 4th case of measles this year - WZZM13.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2wFBVV95cUxNNTkzaTFKajVnc0RJR1Y1aHNPX1k4aTZSckNRam1nYXFzQW9kakRYVkpmTlc5XzNLZFFQR2lZSlpKenVzUmRKS2JhMTJEZi1ZckhFRlZHRFFRRHVUenhrZWZCdzZVdTF6UnFMdUlFaFRLZzVrQThQRWZ2YkY5MkhjTHJvVEM5b01NRWx1NmJ3RlNBQTBMTS1fTWttYTlqajM5QTZVMmNBMDBkNWJZckdsNk5ZOGhqZWRrTGx3MnNWNFJLTm5nTGNYQjc2MmRoQmtpekNobG5BY0JzMWs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;A Montcalm County resident contracted measles after traveling out of state, marking Michigan's fourth case this year.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MONTCALM COUNTY, Mich. — A Montcalm County resident recently traveled out of state and brought back with them a case of the measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes the Montcalm County case the fourth confirmed measles case this year. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mid-Michigan District Health Department (MMDHD) said they're working closely with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to determine points of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MMDHD advised that anyone who is not immune to measles is at risk of catching it. They said the best protection against measles is the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine as the vaccine provides long-lasting protection against measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At MMDHD, we take action to protect, maintain, and improve the health of our community," said Liz Braddock, MMDHD Health Officer. "Measles is a serious disease, and we want to make sure that our residents are safe. If you have recently traveled to regions with known measles outbreaks, and you are not vaccinated against measles, you should consider getting vaccinated as quickly as you can. It is important to make sure you protect yourself and families from this vaccine-preventable disease.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to 9/10 people nearby a person infected with measles will also become infected if they are not protected according to MMDHD.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Infected individuals can spread measles before noticing symptoms, including four days before the rash appears. Measles symptoms usually appear 7 to 14 days after contact with the virus but can take up to 21 days," advised MMDHD in a release.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MMDHD listed the following common measles symptoms to keep an eye out for:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="isPasted"&gt;High fever (may spike to over 104˚F)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots on the inner cheeks, gums and roof of the mouth (Koplik Spots)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that starts as flat red spots on the face at the hairline, then spreads to the trunk, arms and legs three to five days after symptoms begin. Small, raised bumps may also appear on top of the flat red spots&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel you may have been exposed to the measles or develop any of the symptoms listed above, you're asked to call your healthcare provider before seeking treatment so that steps can be taken to prevent exposure to other people before you go in for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The measles vaccine is highly effective, very safe and provides long-lasting protection," said the MMDHD. "A single dose of measles vaccine is about 93% effective at preventing measles, while two doses are about 97% effective. It is also effective if it is given within 72 hours of measles exposure to prevent illness. Anyone not fully vaccinated against measles is encouraged to do so as soon as possible."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor's note: This story previously incorrectly reported this was Michigan's third case of measles this year. It is actually the fourth. The story was updated to include that fourth case in Macomb County.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

This may help explain why frequent cannabis use can increase the risk of hallucinations and delusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using neuromelanin-MRI scans, researchers showed that dopamine-related brain signals were significantly higher in individuals with CUD, and the increase correlated with the severity of use. These findings may help healthcare providers educate youth and high-risk groups about the mental health impacts of chronic cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine Spike:&lt;/strong&gt; People with cannabis use disorder showed elevated dopamine signals in brain regions tied to psychosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Amplified:&lt;/strong&gt; The more severe the cannabis use, the higher the dopamine signal—regardless of schizophrenia diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youth Concern:&lt;/strong&gt; One in five Canadian youth use cannabis frequently, underscoring the need for better public education.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;McGill University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A McGill University-led study found that people with cannabis use disorder (CUD) had elevated dopamine levels in a brain region associated with psychosis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could help explain why cannabis use increases the risk of hallucinations and delusions, key symptoms of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders,” said first author Jessica Ahrens, a PhD student in McGill’s Integrated Program in Neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108537"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Dopamine-cud-psychosis-neurosceince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood and motivation, and an excess is associated with psychosis. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood and motivation, and an excess is associated with psychosis. While it was known that cannabis influences dopamine, this study clarifies where in the brain these changes occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis use disorder is when someone has trouble controlling their cannabis use, continues despite negative effects, and may experience cravings or withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For a long time, clinical researchers across the world have been searching for a link showing that cannabis affects the brain mechanism behind psychosis. We now show that a shared dopamine pathway could be the answer,” Ahrens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 61 people, including those with and without cannabis use disorder, as well as individuals with early-stage schizophrenia, some of whom also had CUD. Using a specialized brain scan called neuromelanin-MRI, researchers at Western University measured their neuromelanin signal, which reflects dopamine activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with CUD had an abnormally high neuromelanin signal, and the elevation was tied to the severity of their cannabis use. In contrast, those without schizophrenia or CUD did not show this increase. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educating youth about cannabis risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one-in-five youth in Canada are cannabis users, consuming it daily or almost daily. Understanding the drug’s impact on mental health remains a pressing question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lack of clear biological evidence linking cannabis to psychosis has made it harder to persuade young people with psychotic symptoms to reduce their use,” said Dr. Lena Palaniyappan, Professor of Psychiatry at McGill and Psychiatrist at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings could help doctors and mental health professionals better educate patients about the potential risks of frequent cannabis use, especially for those with a family history of psychosis,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will explore whether long-term cannabis use leads to lasting dopamine changes and whether these effects reverse after quitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Schizophrenia Society of Canada Foundation, the Canadian Consortium for Early Intervention in Psychosis, the Fonds de Recherche du Québec—Santé, the Quebec Bio-Imaging Network, the Canada First Research Excellence Fund, the Canada Research Chairs program and the Canada Foundation for Innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychosis and CUD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3358565a5f521d575643524356735e50545a5f5f1d5052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Keila DePape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mcgill.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Keila DePape – McGill University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2025.0432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Convergence of Cannabis and Psychosis on the Dopamine System&lt;/a&gt;” by Jessica Ahrens et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convergence of Cannabis and Psychosis on the Dopamine System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite evidence that individuals with a cannabis use disorder (CUD) are at elevated risk of psychosis and that the neurotransmitter dopamine has a role in psychosis, the mechanism linking cannabis use and psychosis remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), referred to as the &lt;em&gt;neuromelanin-MRI signal&lt;/em&gt;, a practical, proxy measure of dopamine function, to assess whether a common alteration in the dopamine system may be implicated in CUD and psychosis and whether this alteration can be observed in those with a CUD whether or not they have a diagnosis of first-episode schizophrenia (FES).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This longitudinal observational cohort study recruited individuals from 2019 to 2023 from an early psychosis service and the surrounding communities in London, Ontario. The sample included individuals with and without CUD, with some in each group also diagnosed with FES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exposures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FES and CUD diagnoses from the Structured Clinical Interview for &lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuromelanin-MRI signals within the midbrain (substantia nigra [SN]/ventral tegmental area [VTA]) including a subregion previously linked to the severity of untreated psychosis (a priori region of interest). Linear mixed-effects analyses were performed relating neuromelanin-MRI signals to clinical measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 36 individuals without CUD (mean [SD] age, 22.3 [3.2] years; 29 male [81%]; 12 with FES) and 25 individuals with CUD (mean [SD] age, 24.3 [4.7] years; 22 male [88%]; 16 with FES) participated in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One-year follow-up was completed for 12 individuals with CUD and 25 without CUD. CUD was associated with elevated neuromelanin-MRI signal in a set of ventral SN/VTA voxels (387 of 2060 SN/VTA voxels, corrected &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .03, permutation test).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CUD was also associated with elevated neuromelanin-MRI signal in the psychosis-related region of interest (&lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;92&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.12, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .04) with a significant dose-dependent association (higher burden of CUD symptoms associated with higher neuromelanin-MRI signal, &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1, 96&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.89; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .03).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, participants with FES did not exhibit a significant elevation in neuromelanin-MRI signal (241 SN/VTA voxels had elevated signal, corrected &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .09). There was no association between time and neuromelanin-MRI signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated dopamine function in a critical SN/VTA subregion may be associated with psychosis risk in people with CUD. Cannabis was associated with the hypothesized final common pathway for the clinical expression of psychotic symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 19:13:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE1VWTMwQnk4bG9LQnE0eEZaN3NST0QwOEw1bzJTWGc3Y2ZFVENTM2hGRUR1cEpfTlZZSDRqQnJpdzB0c29kUEU3aW0zVjNobE1iQ09EUHNLZlhJajRMa0d6VlF5MUp1SHVELWc</guid></item><item><title>Health officials report another measles case in Michigan - WOODTV.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPWmVlRTRHUUM1UGFDYmMxTFF1SWtzSVFabE1ENzVPZzFLNjZsaGJxeHBmVjZjTl9uVEF3SDBIMG5Sa2g3Q2hpaWJ2TkpHeHJ5YmNMYUExM1R3RnlBOTBzQk1TcFlFWEN1RjFEejZTQ3VEODBwMmpHczRJOTNTR3NSbmJ2UmVGRUp4Vkt5d3o2Y05EaFN3eDBVUl9hZGJwU3NDdGd30gGoAUFVX3lxTE9jVzlxYkJiU0NSdTJmMkdoRnAxSTZGRk9BaTRvd2dEd1ppdzd2S2pvamdlWl9EOUNrZENESE9sYmw0QWFoQ25fbDl4RU0yY2lfRTM3MFV1LXVGUXZTNkQ2dGZBTmx5UGNMUjQxd29fNjlrR0I2V2dBWnEyT2lfaUxMbGc5ZjFCUTk1eGRmRjRNUElSNVdCQXNfWGpDcHZ5VGFkYWFfMGtNZg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALLEN COUNTY, Ind. — Five new measles cases have been confirmed in Indiana. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.in.gov/health/idepd/diseases-and-conditions-resource-page/measles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Indiana Department of Health (IDOH)&lt;/a&gt; said the newly reported cases are three minors and two adults in Allen County. This now brings the state total to six people in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial case was &lt;a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/news/health/indiana-first-confirmed-measles-case-of-2025-concerns-pediatricians-vaccine-vaccinations-mmr/531-ff3d974c-9793-40c1-930c-87096cbf4274" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;reported earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, officials said, and all six cases are connected to each other.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently no known links to outbreaks in any other states.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department says the four minors were unvaccinated and the adults’ vaccination status is "unclear." However, all them are recovering.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that spreads easily from person to person," the IDOH said in a news release. "It is an airborne disease, meaning it spreads through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes, or talks. The virus can stay alive in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours. Because measles is so easily spread, a single case is considered an outbreak."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, officials said. People born before 1957 are "presumed to be immune." &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;"Measles begins with a fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes usually about 7 to 14 days after exposure to measles but can occur up to 21 days. The fever increases and can get as high as 105 degrees," the IDOH said. "Tiny white spots (Koplik spots) may appear inside the mouth two to three days after symptoms begin. Then two to four days after symptoms begin, a rash starts on the hairline and face. It spreads down the back and torso, and then extends to the arms and hands, as well as the legs and feet. After about five days, the rash fades the same order in which it appeared."&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What concerns me as a pediatrician is, this didn't have to happen," Indianapolis pediatrician Dr. Eric Yancy said. "Untrue stories came out related to the measles vaccine, which had been completely debunked, completely tossed aside, but yet still they tend to persist. Then immunization rates tend to drop, individuals are susceptible and then you run into problems with recurring cases. And people think, 'Oh, it's just a few spots and a little rash, it goes away.' No. It's a very bad disease. It can cause many types of complications, some serious, some deadly."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

(People with Down syndrome have a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9387748/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:90 percent;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; chance of developing dementia in their lifetime, which is why some Alzheimer's researchers study these patients.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman’s brain was donated to research after her death, and it was analyzed by researchers for signs of Alzheimer’s disease. But while &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63183223/early-signs-and-symptoms-of-alzheimers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:MRI images showed elements;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;MRI images showed elements&lt;/a&gt; in the woman’s brain that suggested she had Alzheimer’s disease, she had no outward signs of the disease before she died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The woman had reached an age when most individuals with Down syndrome develop dementia symptoms, yet she remained cognitively stable,” says &lt;a href="https://rf-research-facility.engineering.pitt.edu/people/jr-jiun-jean-liou-phd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jr-Jiun Jean Liou, PhD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jr-Jiun Jean Liou, PhD,&lt;/a&gt; lead study author and a post-doctoral associate at University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why was the woman not experiencing symptoms of Alzheimer’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That isn’t entirely clear. “Although we conducted comprehensive assessments in cognition, neuroimaging, and fluid biomarkers before her passing, we still don’t fully understand why she showed cognitive resilience,” Liou says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are a few theories. It’s possible that the woman carried the protective e2 allele of the APOE gene (a genetic variant linked to decreased risk of dementia), which could have protected her from actually developing dementia, according to Liou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman also had a larger-than-average brain, which could have given her more brain reserve, allowing her to build up more brain changes linked with Alzheimer’s disease before having symptoms, Liou says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s also possible that her above-average education, associated with healthier lifestyles and life choices, contributed to her cognitive resilience,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this tell us about disease progression?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to say. In Alzheimer’s disease, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8876037/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:amyloid proteins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;amyloid proteins&lt;/a&gt; create plaques between brain cells, which can disrupt communication and function. But “disease progression in the real world is very different than in a laboratory,” says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil, DO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil, DO&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have seen patients with high amyloid burdens sharp as a tack and patients without any amyloid burden unable to tie their own shoes,” he continues. “Studies like this indicate how shaky the amyloid hypothesis of memory loss and dementia is in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Liou says that cases like this one provide “valuable insights” into why some people develop dementia at certain ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else do we know about how women’s brains might differ in the way Alzheimer’s shows up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, &lt;a href="https://apple.news/Ap299Bio0QnOyXH1cfWegwg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:women are almost twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;women are almost twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and dementia, but they're also more resilient to disease progression (meaning, they have more pathology of the disease before they start showing symptoms). “Alzheimer’s dementia often afflicts ladies [at an older age] than it does men and the reasons for this gender difference remains unclear,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women also tend to have denser brains, although it’s not clear why, Dr. Segil says. They also often have a larger store of verbal material, which may mean it takes longer for them to "lose" these words, stories and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Liou calls this a "fascinating case"—and it's easy to see why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 18:20:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1ZUlFrOTRCcm43SXExTWVSZXV5RGJCOVRiTTM2UnY0bXh6bnFJR24xa3ViRUpsMmJ3NmpuTHU3ZXQtNllFcGdLdU5xTE9mQjhIdGJvNklWMEw3YTBOQkU2RHZOMUtsdkRBY1hMN3RodTZhci1rb2RRQg</guid></item><item><title>Bird flu sickens thousands of chickens at NYC poultry markets despite temporary statewide shutdown - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0wFBVV95cUxQT1FwNENMNTNwT0NNaHhqaU5tMDBoRnFzQ0tRUk1ucVREeFprSHNyNnNTYVZDVnRodTl6cmJES1pvNklaUnRxTENVdFRKU2ZTUFkydG1hZWdsOFIxSFBwVjZoN2lqcmFSOWN1OFRrcW1ZMXVDRUx2MkVNUWJJUzJjMUJreEItMzlyNUdKUmdwZXZPREt0c3BIdUxCeWdVaE0xb3ZpTkdNNDRhRnFkRkxfN0xJOGRwSllBdTBJUlZBcnFVREs2N2FOdEt4UUJlLUJpbHBV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;Bird flu is continuing to spread in New York City despite the state’s temporary live market shut down in February — and activists want a total closure of the slaughter houses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At least 4,180 Big Apple birds intended to be sold were found to be infected with the highly contagious virus since March 1, according to data from the &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks"&gt;Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hundreds of birds in the Big Apple have been sickened in bird flu outbreaks at various live markets in the past month, The Post has learned. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Reuters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outbreaks were found in live markets with over 1,000 birds in the Bronx and Queens, as well as smaller flocks in Brooklyn and Staten Island. Eleven outbreaks at live markets have been reported in the last eight weeks, or since Feb. 12 – with seven of those markets in Queens. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These are supposed to be the conditions that have been improved after the governor[‘s] shutdown? This is absolute insanity,” Edita Birnkrant, executive director for animal activist group NYCLASS, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Neither the government nor any other public health official has uttered a word about the surge in outbreaks.” &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Governor Kathy Hochul ordered the shut down and cleaning of all  live poultry markets in New York City in February. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Erik Pendzich/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new infections come weeks after Gov. Kathy Hochul &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/07/us-news/nyc-li-live-poultry-markets-shut-down-after-local-cases-of-bird-flu-discovered/#:~:text=NYC%2C%20Long%20Island%20live%20poultry,cases%20of%20bird%20flu%20discovered&amp;amp;text=All%20live%20poultry%20markets%20in,Kathy%20Hochul%20announced%20Friday."&gt;shut down all live poultry markets in New York City,&lt;/a&gt; Long Island and Westchester County, an order that lasted just over one week. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite activists urging the governor to shutter the live markets for longer as the virus continued to spread – and even claiming some markets were &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/09/us-news/activists-accuse-nyc-shops-of-selling-sickly-chickens-in-scramble-before-bird-flu-shutdown/"&gt;hawking “visibly sickly-looking” chickens&lt;/a&gt; to unsuspecting customers – the ban was lifted on Feb. 19. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same week, the state issued a notice requiring that poultry be tested prior to entering live bird markets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, almost immediately after the ban was lifted, 150 birds at a live market in Queens were found to be sickened by the virus on March 3, according to state data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Customers select a chicken as an employee prepares to slaughter it inside a poultry store. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Activists also reported least one live market in Bushwick, Brooklyn, sporting a dumpster on a public street that was “dripping blood and had rotten chicken corpses inside” in late February, Birnkrant said.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The same live market touted chickens in “gruesome, dire condition,” the activist said, including one with an apparent necrotic wound and another gushing blood. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There were so many [chickens] in such bad shape, clearly sick,” she added. “We have been informed that the New York State AG department will be investigating these markets . . . but in the meantime, these public health hazards remain, and there are animals suffering horribly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More than 300 million birds have been killed from the bird flu to date.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The highly contagious virus can also spread to humans, and has infected 70 people in the US, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development and validation of the tool was described in a study titled “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58274-8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Enabling new insights from old scans by repurposing clinical MRI archives for multiple sclerosis research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Using MindGlide will enable us to use existing brain images in hospital archives to better understand multiple sclerosis and how treatment affects the brain,” Philipp Goebl, PhD, first author of the study at University College London, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/apr/ai-tool-can-track-effectiveness-multiple-sclerosis-treatments"&gt;university press release&lt;/a&gt;. “We hope that the tool will unlock valuable information from millions of untapped brain images that were previously difficult or impossible to understand, immediately leading to valuable insights into multiple sclerosis for researchers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further goal, according to Goebl, is to use MindGlide and other AI tools to help current MS patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In the near future, [we hope] to better understand a patient’s condition through AI in the clinic,” Goebl said. “We hope this will be possible in the next five to 10 years.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Patients typically need multiple scans to assess MS damage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS is caused&lt;/a&gt; by inflammation in the brain and spinal cord that damages healthy nervous system tissue. &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/mri-magnetic-resonance-imaging/"&gt;MRI scans&lt;/a&gt; are a key tool used to track MS disease progression and determine how a person with the neurodegenerative disease is responding to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On MRI scans, MS-related areas of brain damage are visible as white or dark spots, which are known as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-lesions/"&gt;lesions&lt;/a&gt;. Traditionally, lesions have been identified by having experts manually examine MRI scans. This approach is time-consuming, however, and getting the best results usually requires experts to look at several different types of MRI scans of the same brain — meaning patients have to sit through multiple scans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This need for repeated scans is not only inconvenient for patients, but also makes it more logistically difficult to run clinical trials tracking the effects of treatments on lesions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MindGlide was developed with the aim of creating a tool that could accurately identify lesion load in the brain based on a single MRI scan — regardless of the type of scan. Having such a tool would make the process easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, “simplifying MRI analysis, particularly through single [MRI scans], can expand research opportunities from hospital archives, allowing analysis of previously acquired routine-care scans and potentially making clinical trials less costly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other AI tools, MindGlide was developed by first starting with a massive dataset — in this case, the researchers used more than 4,000 MRI scans. These scans were derived from nearly 3,000 people with various types of MS, and acquired with nearly 600 different MRI machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data were fed into a computer alongside a set of mathematical tools, called algorithms, which the computer uses to identify patterns among the information it’s given. By identifying these patterns, the computer is basically able to learn how to identify lesions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;AI tool tested, validated using nearly 15,000 scans from 1,000 patients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trained tool was then tested on nearly 15,000 scans from 1,000 patients followed in clinical trials or as part of routine care. The data demonstrated that MindGlide was better than other state of the art computer tools at identifying MS lesions in accordance with expert reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI tool also was effective at determining the effects of treatments in clinical trial data. In one analysis, the researchers compared MS lesion load and brain atrophy, or shrinkage, in people with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/primary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-ppms"&gt;primary progressive MS&lt;/a&gt; (PPMS) who were treated with either &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ocrevus-ocrelizumab-primary-progressive-relapsing-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Ocrevus&lt;/a&gt; (ocrelizumab) or a placebo. This was also done using scans that have never been used for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that patients given Ocrevus had significantly lower increases in lesion volume and slower rates of brain volume loss across different types of scans. The correlation between lesion load and disability levels was greater with MindGlide than with the standard of care AI tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;We developed and validated [an MRI scan type]-agnostic deep learning model that can quantify MRI biomarkers from routine care and clinical trial datasets from varying single [MRI scans].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other analyses used MindGlide to compare lesion rates in a trial of &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/simvastatin-for-spms/"&gt;simvastatin&lt;/a&gt; against a placebo in people with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/secondary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-spms/"&gt;secondary progressive MS&lt;/a&gt; (SPMS). Results using different scans consistently showed no difference in lesion volume changes over time, but a significant slowing in brain volume loss with simvastatin. Consistently, trial data showed that simvastatin &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2024/09/24/ectrims-2024-simvastatin-fails-slow-disability-progression-spms/"&gt;failed to slow disability progression&lt;/a&gt; in SPMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We developed and validated [an MRI scan type]-agnostic deep learning model that can quantify MRI biomarkers from routine care and clinical trial datasets from varying single [MRI scans],” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A notable limitation of the tool, the team noted, is that it only works on MRI scans of the brain — though MS also can cause damage in the spinal cord, which further contributes to disability. Collectively the brain and spinal cord are known as the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Future work should expand our approach to the entire central nervous system,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

Other diabetes medications, however, were not associated with a change in risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How are dementia and diabetes linked?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the average age of the population steadily rises, the number of dementia cases rises in step. Despite decades of intensive research, a cure remains elusive. Although some treatments can slow progress, we are far from a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to these challenges, if an effective drug were found, it would take many years to build up a sufficient evidence base and millions of dollars to bring it to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, some researchers are focusing on existing drugs. If they can identify a drug that is already widely used and helps lower the risk of dementia, it would be a much shorter road to wider availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some recent research has suggested that &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317462" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and dementia may &lt;a href="https://www.eurekaselect.com/article/95808" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:share some physiological similarities;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;share some physiological similarities&lt;/a&gt;, including inflammation and impaired insulin signalling in the brain. People with diabetes also have a higher risk of developing dementia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises an interesting question: If a drug reduces the impact of type 2 diabetes, might it also reduce the risk of dementia? Scientists have now investigated this question, and some evidence does suggest that diabetes medication &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/13872877251319054" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:may reduce dementia risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;may reduce dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as the authors of the latest study explain, we need more evidence. To build the clearest picture to date, they used “a more rigorous methodological approach and robust adjustment for confounding factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Drugs like Ozempic linked to 33% lower dementia risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate, the scientists accessed data from Florida, Georgia, and Alabama. In total, this amounted to 92,160 people aged 50 or older with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were followed until they died or developed dementia, including &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/159442" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer’s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/vascular-dementia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vascular dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vascular dementia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/316113" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:frontotemporal dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;frontotemporal dementia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/lewy-body-dementia-stages" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lewy body dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lewy body dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They focused on three comparisons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="caas-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1RA versus other second-line glucose-lowering drugs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SGLT2i versus other second-line glucose-lowering drugs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1RA versus SGLT2i.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists concluded that GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is were associated with a reduced risk of developing dementias compared with second-line diabetes drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“GLP-1RA use was associated with a 33% lower risk of [dementia], while SGLT2i use was associated with a 43% lower risk compared with other [glucose-lowering drugs],” the authors write.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; contacted &lt;a href="https://www.fountainlife.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:William Kapp;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;William Kapp&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a longevity expert and CEO of Fountain Life, not involved in tis study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kapp shared his thoughts on the findings, saying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results didn’t shock me — but they did give more credence to what we’ve been observing. Brain and body don’t age separately. Metabolic problems such as insulin resistance are linked to inflammation, oxidative stress, and altered blood flow — all of which impact brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do these drugs reduce dementia risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although scientists do not know for sure how GLP-1RA and SGLT2i may reduce dementia risk in people with type 2 diabetes, the authors suggest some potential mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, GLP-1RAs have been shown to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, SGLT2is may protect the brain by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scientists also explain that both drugs are associated with improved metabolic and vascular health, both of which may support healthy brain function. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there is some evidence that these drugs can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2948479/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reduce levels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reduce levels&lt;/a&gt; of amyloid-beta and tau proteins in the brain — the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking with the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-two-new-studies-on-diabetes-drugs-including-glp-1rss-and-glucose-lowering-drugs-and-dementia-and-alzheimers-risk-in-people-with-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Science Media Center;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Science Media Center&lt;/a&gt;, Prof. &lt;a href="https://experts.exeter.ac.uk/2876-david-strain" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Strain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David Strain&lt;/a&gt;,MD, FRCP, associate professor of cardiometabolic health at the University of Exeter Medical School in the United Kingdom, similarly not involved in the study, explained that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“GLP-1 receptor antagonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors have been demonstrated to control the sugar, and also reduce the inflammation (a key driver of Alzheimer’s disease) and reduce vascular risk (a key driver of vascular dementia) more than would be expected by the sugar control alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is therefore no surprise that these data show a lower risk of dementia in people who receive them as part of her routine care,” Strain continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do we have enough data to draw strong conclusions?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study, which analyzed data from almost 100,000 people is supported by a number of previous studies. However, a paper published in the same journal and on the same day casts a small portion of doubt on the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper in question, also published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2831975" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JAMA Neurology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, is a systematic review and meta-analysis of 26 clinical trials including data from 164,531 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to its authors, “glucose-lowering therapy with GLP1-RAs, but not SGLT2is, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in dementia or cognitive impairment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, their conclusions on GLP1-RAs mirror those from the original paper, but they did not find the same effect for SGLT2is. This may be partly due to the short duration of follow-up. The average study follow-up in the meta-analysis and the follow-up in the original study were under 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As dementia takes many years to develop, this may not be long enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It’s still early, and we’re still not seeing all the long-term data,” Kapp told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;. But what we’re seeing is that regulating insulin and inflammation might also slow down some of the changes in the brain tied to dementia.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inevitable next question is: Will these drugs reduce dementia risk in people without diabetes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the benefit is from reducing insulin resistance or inflammation, it’s possible that these drugs could be good for people without diabetes,” Kapp told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; before injecting some caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just because something is good for one group doesn’t mean it is for others. And there are always risks to long-term use,” he warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the jury is — at least in part — out. We may have to wait for longer studies before we can draw solid conclusions. Still, it is looking increasingly likely that GLP1-RAs might reduce the risk of dementia for people with type 2 diabetes, which is certainly a positive finding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;View the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diabetes-drugs-like-ozempic-or-jardiance-may-slash-alzheimers-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medical News Today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9vNHZGeVA0a2k1aW9CNm1kRm9melNwUE1Nam51WjE3S2FsMmJFSDdta2lLUWhRR3k5VnVoV212MjNCRWZUd2dGX3ByN0tpbE1SUS1WQ3NQeHlrWTV1WUVnMENLUFp1V2VTMWZZZG5nQzVtMlpRcEtNOExLZw</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. says he’s ‘not familiar’ with $11b cuts to state and local health departments - The Hill</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxORnRvWHNTU3VaRDFnbS1iTDhzUVlMbGNnU0ljS3V6djItR090ZUFzcDB2QlFZUTNYYmcwbllCVVRyNDZTcmxiTU9sTUo0eFNWTHdfUXJMSXEzTnl6OGFYNWtMR2NGbDc4Z1pmY1N1MExHT3Qtb0NtY1F1MWxXeDlJS3BLb2VveTJZaUozS1pWWlc0MEJ60gGaAUFVX3lxTE5nOVl6dURSakRuN09wYVJ5UnhydFF4a09iWjJxR0NydWxFV21VN2MxY0J0YVhmWTdjM3VmLXJLcDhtRmZpbGsyUWxNUkhJeVd4VGhHRzVBQXViclFCNEV3QTJJMllhWHE5OGxFSS1fRGgzeHpoTHBLNk1hVzJnZllLNHJfNEVMUGFxUV83aWFjMndrNEhHVHJxaWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__text | body-copy | flow"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health and human services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he was unaware that his agency is trying to rescind more than $11 billion from state and local health departments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“No I’m not familiar with those cuts. We’d have to go … the cuts were mainly DEI cuts, which the president ordered,” Kennedy said in an interview with CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook, parts of which aired Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services last month canceled &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5218628-trump-cancels-health-grants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tens of billions&lt;/a&gt; of dollars in federal grants that state and local health departments were using to track infectious diseases, health disparities, vaccinations, mental health services and other health issues. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HHS said the grants, totaling $11.4 billion, were primarily used for COVID-19 response, including testing, vaccination and hiring community health workers.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;State and local officials said the move will make it even harder for them to continue to fight infectious disease outbreaks, fund substance use disorder support programs and address other concerns.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leaders said the money was already in their hands, and they were using it for much more than just COVID response, including responding to the measles outbreak in Texas.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The funding cuts were &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5231020-federal-judge-temporary-pause-trump-administration-public-health-funding-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;temporarily paused&lt;/a&gt; last week following a lawsuit by Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;LaPook asked if Kennedy was aware that his agency had eliminated a $750,000 grant to the University of Michigan focused on adolescent diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Kennedy said he wasn’t, but said the agency has been fixing mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s a number of studies that were cut that came to our attention and that did not deserve to be cut, and we reinstated them. Our purpose is not to reduce any level of scientific research that’s important,” Kennedy said.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear when that grant was cancelled or if it has been reinstated. The Hill has reached out for more information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3" id="civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068" data-civicscience-widget="3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the same interview, Kennedy for the first time said people should get the measles shot. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I encourage people to get the measles vaccine,” Kennedy said. “The federal government’s position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine, but … the government should not be mandating those.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His comments come as an outbreak primarily among unvaccinated people in West Texas has killed two children and sickened more than 500 people since the start of the year. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;They are the strongest pro-vaccine comments Kennedy has made in any public remarks since he was sworn in as secretary in January.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet in the same interview, Kennedy continued to raise doubts about vaccine safety.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When I say they’re not safety tested, what I mean is they’re not adequately — many of the vaccines are tested for only three or four days with no placebo group,” Kennedy said. “I always said during my campaign and every part, every public statement I’ve made: I’m not gonna take people’s vaccines away from them. What I’m gonna do is make sure that we have good science so that people can make an informed choice.”   &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In an X post last weekend made after visiting the epicenter of the outbreak and attending the funeral of one of the children who died, Kennedy wrote that the measles vaccine is the “most effective way to prevent the spread” of the disease. But he stopped short of recommending it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has touted fringe theories about prevention and treatment, like the benefits of vitamin A and cod liver oil over the measles vaccine, which is the only proven way to prevent infection.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When he has talked about the shot, he’s framed it as a personal choice while also suggesting the vaccine can cause just as much harm as the disease itself. &lt;/p&gt;

Darrow&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist and clinical audiologist, explains. If left untreated, this condition can lead to much more serious problems, including hearing loss,  loss of balance and even dementia. Although there's no cure, there are effective treatment options available to significantly reduce — or even eliminate — your symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dr. Keith Darrow's books&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darrow wrote two books, "Silenced: The Medical Treatment of Tinnitus" and "Quiet: Living with Less Noise," where you can learn about what tinnitus is, the latest treatments for tinnitus, hear personal success stories, and discover how early intervention can provide lasting relief for up to 90% of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="https://silencethesounds.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Silenced: The Medical Treatment of Tinnitus&lt;/a&gt;" is designed to provide valuable information for both those living with tinnitus and people who want to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will gain insight into the latest treatments, coping strategies, and patient success stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you've been struggling with tinnitus for years or are just starting to notice symptoms, this book offers practical tools to help you improve your quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href="https://keap.page/oth387/silenced-medical-treatment-of-tinnitus.html" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to request your free copy of the book, or call (435) 253-6243&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One successful case study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Ruesch is a Utah resident and one of the many people who's found relief through  Darrow's method of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most people, Ruesch's tinnitus started out fairly mild.  He only noticed ringing in his ears late at night or when things were particularly quiet. But over time, the condition worsened to a point where it started to interfere with his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was sick of the ringing in my head," Ruesch recalls. "I was losing sleep, was not  productive at work, and I was becoming less tolerable to be around at home. I was so  desperate that I tried the magic pills, but nothing seemed to work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Ruesch visited his local Excellence in Audiology-certified clinic, &lt;a href="https://www.hearingandbraincenters.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Hearing and Brain Centers&lt;/a&gt; — and that's when things started to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After meeting with Darrow's team to discuss his experience, symptoms and personal goals, Ruesch learned that his tinnitus was the result of hearing damage. According to  Darrow, this is the case for over 90% of all patients suffering from tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Damage to the ears – be it from age, noise or even medications – can compromise the neural connections from ear to brain and cause a significant increase in neural activity in higher brain centers, which the person then perceives as tinnitus," Darrow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The most effective form of treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the best way to treat tinnitus, research over the past decade has been clear: Hearing treatment plans with ongoing support from a specialist and prescription-grade hearing aids are key to successfully restimulating the auditory system and providing tinnitus relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have discovered that the most effective way to treat tinnitus is to provide direct sound stimulation to the brain," Darrow said. He explained that this allows the brain to rewire and make long-term neural changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Hearing and Brain Centers of America&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruesch learned that treatment for tinnitus wouldn't be an overnight fix. In fact, it could take up to six months. But the work and patience turned out to be worth it as he was among the  80% of patients who experienced direct relief from tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now living free from this condition entirely, he sleeps better, he's less anxious and  stressed, and his hearing has improved. And he knows that keeping up with his treatment plan is crucial to maintain these results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New bimodal neuromodulation device, Lenire&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.excellenceinaudiology.org/lenire-for-tinnitus-relief/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Lenire&lt;/a&gt; for Tinnitus Relief is a non-hearing aid option to manage tinnitus symptoms such as ringing, buzzing, chirping in the ears. Primarily used to supplement the direct treatment of tinnitus in patients who need additional tinnitus support beyond the medical treatment of tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It uses a combination of sound therapy and gentle electrical pulses to the tongue to help retrain the brain and reduce the perception of tinnitus. Backed by clinical research,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.excellenceinaudiology.org/lenire-for-tinnitus-relief/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Lenire&lt;/a&gt; offers a safe, at-home solution under professional guidance for those seeking relief from persistent tinnitus symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Seek treatment as soon as possible&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the best results, it's important to treat tinnitus as early as possible. If left untreated,  tinnitus will only get worse and could impact other aspects of your life. Knowing how detrimental it can be — and how much better life is after treatment — Reusch is urging anyone and everyone with the condition to get help sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For anybody who's wondering if they should get treatment, specifically those who are suffering from tinnitus, I say do it," Ruesch said.

Other diabetes medications, however, were not associated with a change in risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the average age of the population steadily rises, the number of dementia cases rises in step. Despite decades of intensive research, a cure remains elusive. Although some treatments can slow progress, we are far from a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to these challenges, if an effective drug were found, it would take many years to build up a sufficient evidence base and millions of dollars to bring it to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, some researchers are focusing on existing drugs. If they can identify a drug that is already widely used and helps lower the risk of dementia, it would be a much shorter road to wider availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises an interesting question: If a drug reduces the impact of type 2 diabetes, might it also reduce the risk of dementia? Scientists have now investigated this question, and some evidence does suggest that diabetes medication &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/13872877251319054" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;may reduce dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as the authors of the latest study explain, we need more evidence. To build the clearest picture to date, they used “a more rigorous methodological approach and robust adjustment for confounding factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate, the scientists accessed data from Florida, Georgia, and Alabama. In total, this amounted to 92,160 people aged 50 or older with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They focused on three comparisons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;GLP-1RA versus other second-line glucose-lowering drugs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SGLT2i versus other second-line glucose-lowering drugs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GLP-1RA versus SGLT2i.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists concluded that GLP-1RAs and SGLT2is were associated with a reduced risk of developing dementias compared with second-line diabetes drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“GLP-1RA use was associated with a 33% lower risk of [dementia], while SGLT2i use was associated with a 43% lower risk compared with other [glucose-lowering drugs],” the authors write.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; contacted &lt;a href="https://www.fountainlife.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;William Kapp&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a longevity expert and CEO of Fountain Life, not involved in tis study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kapp shared his thoughts on the findings, saying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results didn’t shock me — but they did give more credence to what we’ve been observing. Brain and body don’t age separately. Metabolic problems such as insulin resistance are linked to inflammation, oxidative stress, and altered blood flow — all of which impact brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although scientists do not know for sure how GLP-1RA and SGLT2i may reduce dementia risk in people with type 2 diabetes, the authors suggest some potential mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, GLP-1RAs have been shown to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, SGLT2is may protect the brain by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scientists also explain that both drugs are associated with improved metabolic and vascular health, both of which may support healthy brain function. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there is some evidence that these drugs can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2948479/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;reduce levels&lt;/a&gt; of amyloid-beta and tau proteins in the brain — the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking with the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-two-new-studies-on-diabetes-drugs-including-glp-1rss-and-glucose-lowering-drugs-and-dementia-and-alzheimers-risk-in-people-with-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Science Media Center&lt;/a&gt;, Prof. &lt;a href="https://experts.exeter.ac.uk/2876-david-strain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;David Strain&lt;/a&gt;,MD, FRCP, associate professor of cardiometabolic health at the University of Exeter Medical School in the United Kingdom, similarly not involved in the study, explained that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“GLP-1 receptor antagonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors have been demonstrated to control the sugar, and also reduce the inflammation (a key driver of Alzheimer’s disease) and reduce vascular risk (a key driver of vascular dementia) more than would be expected by the sugar control alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is therefore no surprise that these data show a lower risk of dementia in people who receive them as part of her routine care,” Strain continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study, which analyzed data from almost 100,000 people is supported by a number of previous studies. However, a paper published in the same journal and on the same day casts a small portion of doubt on the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper in question, also published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;hl-trusted-source source="JAMA" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2831975" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, is a systematic review and meta-analysis of 26 clinical trials including data from 164,531 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to its authors, “glucose-lowering therapy with GLP1-RAs, but not SGLT2is, was associated with a statistically significant reduction in dementia or cognitive impairment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, their conclusions on GLP1-RAs mirror those from the original paper, but they did not find the same effect for SGLT2is. This may be partly due to the short duration of follow-up. The average study follow-up in the meta-analysis and the follow-up in the original study were under 5 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As dementia takes many years to develop, this may not be long enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It’s still early, and we’re still not seeing all the long-term data,” Kapp told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;. But what we’re seeing is that regulating insulin and inflammation might also slow down some of the changes in the brain tied to dementia.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inevitable next question is: Will these drugs reduce dementia risk in people without diabetes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the benefit is from reducing insulin resistance or inflammation, it’s possible that these drugs could be good for people without diabetes,” Kapp told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; before injecting some caution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just because something is good for one group doesn’t mean it is for others. And there are always risks to long-term use,” he warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the jury is — at least in part — out. We may have to wait for longer studies before we can draw solid conclusions. Still, it is looking increasingly likely that GLP1-RAs might reduce the risk of dementia for people with type 2 diabetes, which is certainly a positive finding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 17:29:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPQ3EzTk1DcHlwQzFNaXpRU0l2VlA0OWx6dGNKZmdvVG50RkY1MWRYYS1rc1J3a3NJSTBwX3JoTEM1VEk3ODczTm5LZTVWa3RtUGdpdEU1RzF4Y1VucUlfeV84bEkxMVN4cUpFZno3WVJfeDdDMGNZQTZPSElxRDI3RlFkd2JXM2RBd3ZqQk05allJeHdPcFZsUmw3U3pHVm1MLV9iV2lXVld4MVZw</guid></item><item><title>This Plant-Based Gum Neutralizes 95% of Flu and Herpes Viruses – And Could Curb the Next Pandemic - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxNV3JpTlFtZVFZWTRIellTMlJGRUJ3ckxTbHFkeGtsd0FZdU9OQ2RSVVZVZk9IS1VmV3NBMmVBc2xFakZ2aXlIdnE3Q1JBRTZRZDNZYXEyLTdpM1UxRGNaNWhCRm45Z0ltcWxiUFB6LS1paFJ5RDRGYkdRRk9QRm9JTkk1eldlNFBkbWpmam9pZUhEdTdCcHJzazAySXNDWUxmaHhrQTNQc2NEUEJGdjMwTXBrT1VMcFVrV1Nzbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 16:09:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxNV3JpTlFtZVFZWTRIellTMlJGRUJ3ckxTbHFkeGtsd0FZdU9OQ2RSVVZVZk9IS1VmV3NBMmVBc2xFakZ2aXlIdnE3Q1JBRTZRZDNZYXEyLTdpM1UxRGNaNWhCRm45Z0ltcWxiUFB6LS1paFJ5RDRGYkdRRk9QRm9JTkk1eldlNFBkbWpmam9pZUhEdTdCcHJzazAySXNDWUxmaHhrQTNQc2NEUEJGdjMwTXBrT1VMcFVrV1Nzbw</guid></item><item><title>I was sufficiently vaccinated against measles in childhood – or so I thought - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxQNmR3UExEMFdUaDN4TEdXT3R5bGR6TmhDWUxSX0FRdTVuWEk3ZzJ2Z2ZJMHlHQzNfWE1fN05hTnBtWXh6MDFiNzB2RnE3cGEyYzB4Sm9fb2tSLXlzRzBfSl9uRndiSTFrVVNjQV9BU2dCN05lcElITWZHYlFBTmJTQ011eFo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;hen I enrolled in graduate school at the age of 53, I knew I would probably be the oldest student in class.

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Titer tests, my doctor explained, measure antibody levels in the blood. The results threw me for a loop. My immunity to rubella was sufficient, but mumps and measles antibodies were too low, and I needed an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/mmr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;MMR&lt;/a&gt; vaccine before stepping foot on campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It was a simple fix, but the incident lingered in my mind. Why were my titers low for measles antibodies despite two rounds of the vaccine? With &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/06/texas-measles-death-child" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;record outbreaks this year&lt;/a&gt; – 607 in the US as of 3 April 2025 – I wondered if older adults should be concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-if-i-was-vaccinated-between-1963-and-1967" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What if I was vaccinated between 1963 and 1967?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to Dr Scott Roberts, a Yale Medicine infectious disease specialist, adults who were immunized against measles between 1963 and 1967 – as I was – are at risk. During that period, said Roberts, children received either an inactivated measles vaccine or a live one. The inactivated version was less effective; it was discontinued in 1967.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;According to&lt;/a&gt; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 1 million people in the US received the inactivated vaccine between 1963 and 1967. (It was tested in clinical trials in the UK but never put into widespread use.) Per my mother’s records, my second measles vaccine was live, but the first one, administered at the end of 1967, was not, which could explain the low titers test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If you know you received the inactivated vaccine, said Dr Aniruddha Hazra, a UChicago Medicine infectious disease expert, or don’t know which one you got in the 1960s, “get the MMR vaccine again. There is no harm in getting the shot even if you are fully immunized.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Adults can confirm immunity with a titer test, like I did, but the test can cost more than the MMR vaccine. “If you would rather get the titers checked first,” said Hazra, “that’s a conversation to have with your healthcare provider.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"5e677e23-c5c2-453e-89ad-d895188dc1fd","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="5e677e23-c5c2-453e-89ad-d895188dc1fd" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But a low titer test doesn’t necessarily mean you’re susceptible to infection. Dr Robert Bednarczyk, an associate professor of global health and epidemiology at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, explained that even if vaccinated individuals don’t have detectable circulating antibodies, they probably have memory cells in their immune system ready to produce more antibodies against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-if-i-was-born-before-1957" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What if I was born before 1957?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, measles was a major cause of death in children under five. Infection could lead to hearing loss, deafness or debilitating neurological side effects. What is the current recommendation for adults born before the vaccine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Anyone born before 1957 was exposed to measles,” said Hazra. “Based on that, the CDC and ACIP [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices] said we can assume you were exposed or acquired measles, and measles immunity is lifelong.” This means no additional vaccine is recommended for this age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="one-shot-or-two" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;One shot or two?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If you’re wondering how many shots you should have had, the answer is slightly muddy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Until 1989, the CDC recommended only one dose of the MMR vaccine for children. Thereafter, a second MMR dose was recommended to help “increase the immune response in the small number of people who didn’t fully respond to the first dose”, said Bednarczyk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The CDC currently recommends two doses of the measles vaccine for children and “one or two” doses for adults, reserving the two-dose recommendation for adults identified as high-risk, such as those in higher learning and healthcare settings, or who are traveling internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“One dose is very effective at preventing measles,” said Bednarczyk. “This is important, because many people born before the mid or late 1980s likely only received one dose of the MMR vaccine.” But, he added, people vaccinated prior to the two-dose recommendation benefited from high MMR vaccine uptake, which greatly reduced the risk of large measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The vaccination landscape has changed in recent years. Since the 2019-20 school year, vaccination rates amongst school children – targeted for 95% – have fallen dramatically. According to KFF, a non-profit health policy organization, only &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline-as-trump-heads-for-a-second-term/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;11 US states&lt;/a&gt; reported vaccination rates of 95% or higher in the 2023-24 school year. Previous vaccination recommendations took into account the fact that measles had been eradicated in the US, said Hazra. “All adults living in the US should be considered high-risk” right now, he says, and should receive two live doses at some point in their life, except for adults born before 1957.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-21" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you know you were vaccinated with the two doses of the live vaccine, he says, there is no recommendation for another dose, even in an outbreak or traveling internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="does-measles-immunity-wane-over-time" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Does measles immunity wane over time?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;, the US health secretary, remarked &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/12/health/measles-rfk-vaccine-immunity/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in an interview&lt;/a&gt; that immunity from the MMR vaccine “wanes 4.5% a year” and that “older people are essentially unvaccinated”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“That is factually incorrect,” said Hazra. “If it was true, we would be seeing more measles in people with histories of vaccination.” Hazra stresses the importance of including older adults in the discussion about measles protection; they’re more vulnerable to possible complications from measles infections, which include pneumonia. But all the experts I spoke to warn against widespread misinformation about the measles vaccine. “Levels of antibodies against the measles virus may decline over time,” adds Bednarcdzyk. “But in the cases we’ve seen so far in 2025, only 3% of the cases had documented history of measles vaccine receipt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="are-there-side-effects-from-the-mmr-vaccine" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Are there side effects from the MMR vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bednarczyk cites “no big differences for adults compared to children” and that side effects usually clear up in a few days. “A lot of these live vaccines elicit a greater immune response for 24-48 hours,” adds Hazra. “The body is mounting an immune response and creating a lot of energy to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The most common side effects are fever, soreness and swelling at the site of the injection, headache, muscle aches, tiredness or a mild rash. “In some very rare cases,” said Bednarczyk, “there may be a short-term drop in blood platelet levels after vaccination, which can also happen if you are infected with measles virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2882aa02-374b-4d92-89ab-c15df3f51dd0" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":30,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Wonder drug or waste of money?

(By comparison, individuals with seasonal influenza usually infect about two other people.) “Airborne pathogens hang around for two hours,” added Hazra. “It can infect so many people because of this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The MMR vaccination is significantly safer than acquiring natural immunity via infection. “Having the measles disease runs the risk of complications later on,” said Nguyen. These include subsequent measles infections from “immune amnesia” and serious complications from measles-related encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Anyone who is unsure about their vaccination status should speak to their healthcare provider about an MMR or titer test. A high level of immunity across the US will help protect everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQNmR3UExEMFdUaDN4TEdXT3R5bGR6TmhDWUxSX0FRdTVuWEk3ZzJ2Z2ZJMHlHQzNfWE1fN05hTnBtWXh6MDFiNzB2RnE3cGEyYzB4Sm9fb2tSLXlzRzBfSl9uRndiSTFrVVNjQV9BU2dCN05lcElITWZHYlFBTmJTQ011eFo</guid></item><item><title>This Alabama city is among the 10 worst for sexually transmitted infections - AL.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AM5IROILMBACTGGNE5MVPRYYLE"&gt;Montgomery is one of the nation’s worst cities for the rate of sexually transmitted infections, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DF4GFYVGF5CV5D4HPQEDB2PTHE"&gt;And Mobile, while lower on the list, is not far behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LE7XEN7ILFGFRAQLVR7IMF4UVI"&gt;In their 8th annual study on national STI data, the Innerbody Research Institute found that over 60% of the top 25 metropolitan areas with the highest STI rates are in the South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VKJLUM3IAZFWRKPUNB2WJCYZAE"&gt;Although Detroit, Mich., is home to the highest rate of STIs, with 1,491 cases per 100,000 residents, nearly half of the remaining top ten rankings are in the South -- including Montgomery, which ranks third with 1,446 cases of sexually transmitted diseases per 100,000 residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LVB5DFN5NBH45NWJ7Z74J3WSEA"&gt;Cases of chlamydia account for the highest number in Alabama’s capital city, with 3,363 over the past year, followed by gonorrhea with 1,771 cases; 204 cases of syphilis; and 97 cases of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="74OMY6XTNBB6LLJMBMTBGLZXSY"&gt;Mobile ranks 11th on the list with 1,277 STI cases per 100,000 residents.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chia pudding is the most underrated breakfast for increasing your fiber intake. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chia seeds are also rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which help reduce inflammation, support heart health and protect brain health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This meal-prep-friendly breakfast can be customized to the flavors of your choosing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to fiber-filled breakfasts, oatmeal often steals the spotlight—but there’s another option that’s nutrient-dense, versatile and surprisingly easy to overlook: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chia seed pudding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Made with just a few pantry staples, chia pudding is a fiber-packed meal that’s simple to prepare the night before and endlessly customizable. Whether you’re looking to improve your gut health, stay full through the morning or just streamline your morning routine, here’s why chia pudding should be your go-to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-its-seriously-high-in-fiber"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; It’s Seriously High in Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds may be tiny, but they pack a major fiber punch. Just 1 ounce of chia seeds (about 2½ tablespoons) delivers an impressive 10 grams of dietary fiber—about 36% of the recommended daily intake for most adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This recipe calls for 2 tablespoons of chia seeds alongside fruit, which bumps the fiber to 11 grams per serving. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most of the fiber in chia seeds is soluble fiber, which forms a gel-like substance in the gut that slows digestion and promotes fullness. Wendy Bazilian, Dr.P.H., RDN, a nutrition expert and host of the &lt;a href="https://wendybazilian.com/podcast" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;1,000 Waking Minutes podcast&lt;/a&gt;, says, “Human clinical trials have shown that this gel-like fiber delays gastric emptying, promotes regular bowel movements and may contribute to helping with satiety and fullness after meals.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bazilian also points to a study finding that chia has the ability to convert glucose into a slow-release carbohydrate and keep you fuller longer, even more so than flax—possibly because its fiber forms a thicker, more gel-like texture in the gut.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-its-rich-in-omega-3-fatty-acids"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; It’s Rich in Omega-3 Fatty Acids &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are one of the best plant-based sources of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; that support heart, brain and overall health. They’re especially high in ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), which the body can convert into other important omega-3s called DHA and EPA—the ones most people associate with fatty fish. While that conversion isn’t super efficient, Bazilian notes a growing understanding suggesting the body may convert just what it needs, with regular turnover to help maintain healthy levels over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; ALA has important benefits of its own, too. In fact, higher ALA intake has been linked to lower inflammation, healthier cholesterol levels and reduced risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For anyone following a more plant-based or flexitarian diet, chia seeds are a simple way to meet omega-3 needs in just 2 tablespoons a day. A 1-ounce serving of chia seeds provides about 5 grams of ALA—well above the recommended daily intake of 1.1 grams for women and 1.6 grams for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-its-perfect-for-meal-prep"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; It’s Perfect for Meal Prep &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia pudding may be one of the easiest breakfasts you can make. It requires no cooking, just a quick stir of chia seeds into your favorite milk, and a little time in the fridge. Once chilled for a few hours or overnight, the seeds absorb the liquid and thicken into a creamy, pudding-like texture. It keeps well in the fridge for up to three days, making it perfect for prepping a few puddings ahead of time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-its-versatile-and-customizable"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; It’s Versatile and Customizable &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the best parts about chia pudding is how easy it is to make it your own. Start with the base recipe, and from there you can switch up the flavors and toppings depending on what you’re in the mood for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Try mixing in different fruits like sliced bananas, berries or peaches, or various nuts like almonds, pistachios or walnuts. Stir in a dash of cinnamon or cocoa powder for extra flavor, or stir in a spoonful of creamy peanut butter for an extra protein boost.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-tips-for-eating-more-fiber"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Tips for Eating More Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The daily recommended amount of fiber ranges from about 25 to 38 grams depending on age and sex. Chia pudding is a great way to start your day with fiber, but it’s important to prioritize fiber throughout the entire day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As Bazilian puts it, “It’s the small, consistent additions that add up to big benefits for digestion, blood sugar balance and satiety.” Here are a few simple ways to get more fiber into your meals and snacks. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Seeds and Nuts:&lt;/strong&gt; Toss chia, flax, hemp or pumpkin seeds onto smoothies, salads and yogurt. A couple of tablespoons can add several grams of fiber, alongside healthy fats and protein. Basilian says, even small additions—like a tablespoon of chia seeds in a smoothie with 5 grams of fiber—can make a meaningful impact.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose Whole Grains:&lt;/strong&gt; Swapping white bread, pasta and rice for whole-grain varieties is a small change but something that can make a big difference over time. Try options like quinoa, farro, brown rice, bulgur or whole-grain bread and cereals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fill Half Your Plate with Fruits and Vegetables:&lt;/strong&gt; Vegetables and fruits, especially when you eat the skin, are excellent sources of fiber. Aim to include a fruit or vegetable at every meal, and mix up the colors to get a larger range of nutrients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lean on Legumes:&lt;/strong&gt; Legumes like lentils, black beans, chickpeas and kidney beans are loaded with both fiber and plant-based protein. They’re an easy, budget-friendly way to increase your fiber intake. Toss them into soups, stews, salads or grain bowls for a filling and nutritious upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Remarkably, the device simply dissolves after it’s no longer needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designed for newborns, the pacemaker could transform temporary heart care after congenital defect surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-controlling-the-heart-with-light"&gt;Controlling the heart with light&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new pacemaker is smaller than a grain of rice. It’s wirelessly activated through pulses of light which are delivered by a soft, wearable device mounted on the patient’s chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The external controller detects abnormal rhythms and sends light through the body to activate the pacemaker and restore heartbeat. The study demonstrates the device’s effectiveness across animal and human donor hearts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development of the pacemaker was led by John A. Rogers, a professor of material science, biomedical engineering, and neurological surgery at &lt;a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have developed what is, to our knowledge, the world’s smallest pacemaker,” said Professor Rogers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a crucial need for temporary pacemakers in the context of pediatric heart surgeries, and that’s a use case where size miniaturization is incredibly important. In terms of the device load on the body – the smaller, the better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-solution-designed-for-newborns"&gt;Solution designed for newborns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the light-activated pacemaker can function in patients of all sizes, its miniaturized design was motivated by the needs of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/infant-speech-is-driven-by-heart-rate-activity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;infants&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Igor Efimov is a co-leader of the study and experimental cardiologist at Northwestern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“About 1% of children are born with congenital heart defects. The good news is that these children only need temporary pacing after a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/worlds-smallest-robot-could-transform-minimally-invasive-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;surgery&lt;/a&gt;. In about seven days or so, most patients’ hearts will self-repair. But those seven days are absolutely critical,” said Efimov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional pacemakers require surgery and have wires sticking out of the chest to connect to an external device. When they are no longer needed, the wires are removed – risking bleeding, tissue damage, or even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wires literally protrude from the body, attached to a pacemaker outside the body,” Efimov explained. “When the pacemaker is no longer needed, a physician pulls it out. The wires can become enveloped in scar tissue. That’s actually how Neil Armstrong died.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new injectable pacemaker addresses these risks. All of its components are biocompatible and bioresorbable, meaning they safely dissolve in the body’s fluids without needing surgical removal.

Surgeons asked for a smaller version to allow easier placement and suit the smallest patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original device used near-field communication (NFC), but its antenna limited how small the device could be made. To overcome this, the team replaced the NFC system with a novel light-based mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/04/09091552/pacemaker_light-activated_worlds-smallest_heart-health_Northwestern_1m.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/04/09091558/pacemaker_light-activated_worlds-smallest_heart-health_Northwestern_1s.webp" alt="The tiny pacemaker sits next to a single grain of rice on a fingertip.

Rogers/Northwestern University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead of using the radio frequency scheme for wireless control, we developed a light-based scheme for turning the pacemaker on and delivering stimulation pulses to the surface of the heart. This is one feature that allowed us to dramatically reduce the size,” said Professor Rogers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-powered-by-the-body-s-own-fluids"&gt;Powered by the body’s own fluids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engineers also reimagined how to power the tiny pacemaker. Rather than requiring a battery or external power source, the device uses a simple galvanic cell – a chemical battery formed by two different metals as electrodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the device is inside the body, surrounding biofluids act as the electrolyte, allowing electrical current to flow and stimulate the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A very tiny light-activated switch on the opposite side from the battery allows us to turn the device from its ‘off’ state to an ‘on’ state upon delivery of light that passes through the patient’s body from the skin-mounted patch,” explained Professor Rogers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reducing-trauma-and-risk"&gt;Reducing trauma and risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using infrared light, which can safely penetrate deep into the body, the wearable controller detects when a patient’s heart rate falls too low. It then triggers a light-emitting diode (LED) to flash on and off at the desired pacing rhythm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Infrared light penetrates very well through the body,” Efimov said. “If you put a flashlight against your palm, you will see the light glow through the other side of your hand. It turns out that our bodies are great conductors of light.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its microscopic size – just 1.8 mm wide, 3.5 mm long, and 1 mm thick – the pacemaker delivers stimulation on par with traditional devices. “The heart requires a tiny amount of electrical stimulation,” Rogers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By minimizing the size, we dramatically simplify the implantation procedures, we reduce trauma and risk to the patient, and, with the dissolvable nature of the device, we eliminate any need for secondary surgical extraction procedures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-era-of-heart-care"&gt;A new era of heart care&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these light-activated pacemakers are so small and wireless, doctors could one day deploy multiple units on different parts of the heart to create more advanced pacing systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each device could be controlled independently using different light wavelengths, enabling personalized and precisely timed stimulation across the heart’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can deploy a number of such small pacemakers onto the outside of the heart and control each one,” Efimov said. “Then we can achieve improved synchronized functional care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Rogers noted that because it’s so small, the pacemaker can be integrated with almost any kind of implantable device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also demonstrated integration of collections of these devices across the frameworks that serve as transcatheter aortic valve replacements to address complications that can occur during a patient’s recovery process,” said Rogers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-of-bioelectronic-medicine"&gt;Future of bioelectronic medicine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this breakthrough has clear implications for pediatric heart care, the technology could pave the way for a new generation of bioelectronic medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tiny, dissolvable devices could one day be adapted to promote nerve and bone regeneration, manage &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mindfulness-meditation-is-a-powerful-weapon-against-chronic-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt;, support wound healing, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northwestern engineers shrank the device and removed risks by making it dissolve after use.  In doing so, they’ve created a tool that could reshape how doctors care for the heart – from the tiniest patients to adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click here to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/j_0hZ8cUwgo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;watch a video interview…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08726-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-ralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 15:24:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxQcDlIa2ZXWW9oYlY2Uk1WNEZMZVM4cUg3ZWZrTFliQzlmZ2U1dDBOdVNhcngzQ0pEQ3hVd0NNYWZvaFNGNnRIWHhpMGRmTFViYm9VZlhZUGhGTjl5RG1BdzlWbzh4SGhHUF9zaFotN3ZKQnlqRm9QblZBVjdRWEYwbzdlZHBVNUs4aWxvemkteTRfY01QWmtJNzJjamkwSnVRWjJHS3pjeDN4eU1DQUE</guid></item><item><title>Weight loss without dieting?

The surprising truth about fiber and fat loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Navneet Deora, PhD in Food at Bluetribe, shared, “Due to the nature of fibres in terms of its functionality and solubility in water it can be broadly classified as soluble or insoluble and fermentable or non-fermentable. Solubility depends on the extent to which the fibre dissolves in water or forms a gel. Fermentability relates to whether the undigested fibres that reach the large intestine are fermented by anaerobic bacteria to yield short-chain fatty acids and gases such as methane and hydrogen. The type of fibre does play a critical role in the area of weight management.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="shortEntryContainer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_630x354/HT/p2/2018/08/26/Pictures/_a823ad1c-a922-11e8-8937-8a80aaa2408c.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Weight loss diet: A heart-healthy diet that is high in fibre and low in saturated fats is a great way to prevent and reduce abdominal obesity.(Shutterstock)" title="Weight loss diet: A heart-healthy diet that is high in fibre and low in saturated fats is a great way to prevent and reduce abdominal obesity.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Weight loss diet: A heart-healthy diet that is high in fibre and low in saturated fats is a great way to prevent and reduce abdominal obesity.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Substantial research has been conducted to ascertain the relationship between fibre and weight management and typically it shows an inverse relationship between dietary fibre intake and change in body weight. Dr Navneet Deora explained, “Dietary fibre’s ability to decrease body weight or attenuate weight gain could be attributed to several factors. Under conditions of fixed energy intake, the majority of studies indicate that an increase in either soluble or insoluble fibre intake increases post-meal satiety and decreases subsequent hunger.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What fiber really does to your body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Navneet Deora elaborated, “For example, soluble fibre, when fermented in the large intestine, produces glucagon-like peptides and peptides. These two gut hormones play a role inducing satiety. Second, dietary fibre may significantly decrease energy intake. It is important to understand that dietary fibre still contributes to the total caloric content of a diet, it is much more resistant to digestion by the small intestine and even somewhat resistant in the large intestine.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the expert, consumption of insoluble fibre decreases energy digestibility while it increases with soluble fibre intake. Dr Navneet Deora said, “The mode of action behind these findings may be due to the fact that insoluble fibre causes an increased rate of passage through the GI tract. This would be expected to result in diminished digestion and absorption of nutrients. This both soluble and insoluble fibre may lead to weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2022/09/23/550x309/kokum_recipes_thumb_1663940453719_1663940461966_1663940461966.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Low in calories and fats and rich in soluble fibre, kokum is excellent for weight loss and lowering cholesterol.(Pinterest)" title="Low in calories and fats and rich in soluble fibre, kokum is excellent for weight loss and lowering cholesterol.(Pinterest)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Low in calories and fats and rich in soluble fibre, kokum is excellent for weight loss and lowering cholesterol.(Pinterest)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, there seems to be a relationship between the type of diet (high or low fat) and the type of fibre consumed. Dr Navneet Deora highlighted, “Insoluble fibre may play a more important role for weight loss during consumption of a high fat diet. Since resistant starch is a constituent of dietary fibre and undergoes the same digestion as insoluble fibre, comparing resistant starch and insoluble fibre may give us a better understanding of how dietary fibre can be used to treat and prevent obesity. Thus, although increasing dietary fibre in general has a favourable effect on body weight, more research is warranted to determine the optimal dietary fibres for the purpose of weight management.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association Eating Plan suggests aiming for 25 to 30 grams of dietary fibre daily from food sources which translates to aprox 14 g/1000 kcal in children and adults. Dr Navneet Deora opined, “The diets with a high content of fibre, such as those rich in cereals, fruits and vegetables have a positive effect on health since their consumption has been related to a decreased incidence of several types of diseases.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He concluded, “Its beneficial effects are decreasing the time of intestinal transit, cholesterol and glycaemic levels, trapping substances that can be dangerous for the human organism (mutagenic and carcinogenic agents), stimulating the proliferation of the intestinal flora etc. Diets can have a variety of fibre rich foods (both soluble and insoluble) such as wheat straw, oats, soy bran, rice bran, apples, legumes, mucilaginous fibre.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Frail people are much more likely to die young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This one is much more subjective, but &lt;/span&gt;Dr Bickman believes Ozempic could lead to people becoming 'mentally fragile'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He highlights anecdotal evidence from patients who say that Ozempic not only dulled their cravings for food, but also for other pleasures in life such as sex, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-fe7d7ce0-154c-11f0-b126-f329c23c217c"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, coffee and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ben Bickman, pictured, says that people should be weary of the outfall that will come with weight loss medications and he predicts three crippling failures of Ozempic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Bickman says: 'The benefit in reducing cravings for sweet food may actually be a reduction in cravings for life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He fears patients could succumb to depression as a result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pointing to one study, Dr Bickman reveals: 'Patients on the drug experience a 195 percent increased risk of major depression and over 100 per cent greater risk of suicidal behavior.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, another investigation which looked at a World Health Organization database that tracks suspected adverse drug reactions, and found that there was a 45 percent greater rate of reports of suicidal thoughts associated with semaglutide compared with all other drugs in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, countering these findings the FDA released a statement in January 2024 saying it had found no connection between the drugs and suicidal thoughts and in April of the same year. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) did the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next up, Dr Bickman claims that in the long run, weight loss medications have the potential to make people fatter than they were in the first place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Explaining how people go on to regain weight after taking Ozempic for a period of time, he says: 'Ozempic is effective at reducing cravings... However well this works, it works until it doesn't. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'At around two years of use, people find that the sweet cravings return to normal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Interestingly, this is also when many people decide to quit the drug and about 70 percent of users stop the drug at two years.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study Dr Bickman refers to, which included an analysis of US pharmacy claims provided to Reuters, did not include details about why patients quit but costs could come into play. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic carries a price tag of approximately $1,000 monthly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And touching on his theories around weight gain, a 2022 clinical trial following about 200 people who had taken semaglutide for more than a year and lost an average of 17 percent of their body weight, looked at what happened when they stopped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found that they regained about 12 percent of their body weight within a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another recent study by Northwestern University found a majority of people who stopped taking semaglutide regained about two-thirds of the weight lost and had worsening health markers, including higher blood pressure and cholesterol and increased risk of heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Continuing on the subject, Dr Bickman adds: 'While muscle and bone mass might never return, the body has no trouble regaining fat mass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What's more, one study found that one version of these drugs, actually stimulates the production of new fat cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This becomes a problem because when a person start to regain fat mass after stopping Ozempic, with more fat cells comes a greater potential to gain more fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As a result, even though a person may still weight less than they did before starting the drug, they may be fatter, with a higher percentage of body fat.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite his concerns around the side effects of Ozempic and other &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-991e5000-1546-11f0-b126-f329c23c217c"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; drugs, Dr Bickman highlights that he is not against them but it is more the dosing that he is concerned about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adults with type 2 diabetes take Ozempic once per week to lower blood sugar levels, and they usually begin with a 0.25mg dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This lower dose allows the body to become accustomed to the medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At week five, doctors typically increase the dose to 0.5 mg once a week if the patient tolerates the medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weight loss patients typically follow the same dosing schedule, but their doses might may be increased to as much as 2 mg once weekly and Dr Bickman believes these amounts are too high. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking on a podcast with health influencer Thomas DeLauer about the positives and negatives of weight loss drugs, Dr Bickman explains: 'I'm not [opposed to these drugs]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Bickman's hope is that weight loss drugs can be used more responsibly to reduce the possibility of any negative repercussions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When they were in their original dose I actually looked at them as one of the more remarkable drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At this original lower dose I considered this to actually be a favorable balance... [something that] is really helping people control their blood sugar levels andthe fact that it would help with their cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[But now] that we've gone to these literal multiples and doses becoming higher the  harder it's getting for me to look at them favorably.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Bickman's hope is that weight loss drugs can be used more responsibly to reduce the possibility of any negative repercussions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told this website: 'They should be used at the lowest possible dose that shows efficacy in controlling carbohydrate addictions and cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Users should also be encouraged to prioritize dietary protein and fat, especially from animal-sourced foods such as dairy, meat, and eggs, to help build their strength, while frequent strength training can help prevent any loss of lean mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And finally, patients should be encouraged to stop the drug after a period of use, at which time they assess their cravings for carbohydrates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ideally, a person has learned how to eat better and control carb cravings and their weight loss can be sustained in the long run.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 14:48:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Women should avoid all alcohol to reduce risk of breast cancer, charity says - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxOTzFEV09Qb2hKS200R2lzTngyM044Y0M3bHBCSkVneWNCR09OOE4xekFPdXRNVXdGUE85OGVjMDk0S1NySlFaN2JBRV9KUE5UNkh1YjhLaXFRVG9BU2t4XzU1a2R5WlRjYUdKMF9KOEVTd25MSGYxU0pKVmZlZUJqUERXd1NKQ0V1c2RRVTRQRXVCNXFkemZuZVBrOThYSDRuTk1wemhaTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Women should avoid alcohol altogether to reduce their risk of breast cancer, a charity has warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The World &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt;

In mice, researchers found that different regions of the thalamus—the brain’s sensory hub—respond uniquely depending on whether the animal actively explored with its whiskers or passively received a touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While one part of the thalamus was engaged in both types of touch, the posterior medial thalamus primarily responded to passive stimuli, especially when those touches were unexpected. This separation likely helps animals interpret and react appropriately to environmental cues, including potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; Active and passive touch are processed in different thalamic regions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POm Sensitivity:&lt;/strong&gt; The posterior medial thalamus is especially reactive to passive and unexpected touches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Separating touch types may help animals distinguish between self-directed actions and external threats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Though the sense of touch underlies how we and most other animals interact with the world around us, much remains unknown about how this sense is processed in the brain. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Heidelberg University and Ludwig Maximillan University Munich in Germany measured the neuronal activity differences between active touch and passive touch in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108524"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a hand holding a brain and another reaching out to touch it." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/touch-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Processing these types of touch in different regions of the brain may allow animals to respond quickly and appropriately in their natural environments. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As reported April 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the open-access journal, &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers find that active and passive touch are processed by different pathways in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active touch can be thought of as grabbing something with your hand, while passive touch would be something brushing against you. Mice, as well as many other animals, use their whiskers to sense the world around them, much like how we use our fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To actively touch something, mice move their whiskers around, “whisking” the object they are investigating. They also passively sense touch through their whiskers when an object touches them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers measured whisker movement and neuronal activity in the mice, focusing on the thalamus, the part of the brain that processes all senses except for smell. The mice either actively interacted with an object or the researchers delivered a puff of air to passively stimulate the whiskers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The baseline activity of the thalamus was generally higher before the mice engaged in active touching, and one part of the thalamus responded to both active and passive touch. However, another part called the posterior medial thalamus primarily responded to passive touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This region also had the highest activity when long intervals had passed between puffs of air, which the researchers propose may be connected to the mouse’s surprise at the touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Touch is important for many essential activities from finding food to social interaction. Passive touch, in particular, can also help animals sense danger, such as a predator lurking nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processing these types of touch in different regions of the brain may allow animals to respond quickly and appropriately in their natural environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors add, “Being touched and touching something can lead to the same primary sensation but mean entirely different things. We explored how active and passive touch are represented differently in the brain and find that the higher-order thalamus (POm) strongly differentiates these situations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this tactile perception and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#55373c3a393a322c25273026261525393a267b3a2732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Claire Turner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://plos.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Claire Turner – PLOS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003108" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Active and passive touch are differentially represented in the mouse somatosensory thalamus&lt;/a&gt;” by Anton Sumser et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active and passive touch are differentially represented in the mouse somatosensory thalamus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active and passive sensing strategies are integral to an animal’s behavioral repertoire. Nevertheless, there is a lack of information regarding the neuronal circuitry that underpins these strategies, particularly at the thalamus level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We evaluated how active versus passive whisker deflections are represented in single neurons of the ventral posteromedial thalamus (VPM) and the posterior medial thalamus (POm) in awake mice. These are the first- and higher-order thalamic nuclei of the whisker system, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VPM neurons robustly responded to both active and passive whisker deflections, while POm neurons showed a preference for passive deflections and responded poorly to active touches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This response disparity could not be explained by stimulus kinematics and only in part by the animal’s voluntary whisking state. In contrast, cortical activity significantly influenced POm’s responses to passive touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inhibition of the barrel cortex strongly attenuated whisker responses in POm and simultaneously increased the whisking phase coding. This suggests that POm receives touch information from the cortex which strongly adapts and is gated by rare events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings suggest two thalamic relay streams, where VPM robustly relays both active and passive deflection, while POm’s sensitivity requires top-down cortical involvement to signal salient events such as unexpected deflections, originating in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 14:09:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE44R1ZaZ1Y3SVZfUkxqaHFDbjVQZUdUaURUZ1I5d2hJME9INTYyaFZsZXN5Z2lLVVRzdGV5NUhLR3c1dDYwZnVGVUtpTnFUYmVFMkxFT1pIUGR3Xy13OS1WaUlpb0lfM3ltTWY5ZA</guid></item><item><title>Eye Clues May Reveal Early Dementia Risk - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE1uejlzTm9TbGZKX09FTDByS3o4dHY3TUNqdWFmSlpKNnZvRWJqZlpwTFNCUXlldVdPVTJEMTh3Q1ptRVlrYlFYNXhHeUlYOG9LeDBKSEp1T3EtRG8yY3hFTWlqLVEwc3RJdmdwOVpn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study has found that blood vessels in the retina may hold early clues about a person’s risk of developing dementia. Researchers observed that narrower arterioles, wider venules, and thinner retinal nerve fiber layers were linked to higher dementia risk around midlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These eye changes may mirror brain changes tied to Alzheimer’s, offering a non-invasive way to detect risk earlier than current cognitive tests allow.

Measures of retinal health could offer accessible and low-cost indication of pre-morbid disease risk, but their association with ADRD risk is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine whether midlife retinal neuronal and microvascular measures are associated with ADRD risk-index scores and individual domains of ADRD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data were from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, a population-representative longitudinal New Zealand-based birth cohort study. 94.1% (N = 938) of living Study members were seen at age 45 (2017–2019).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retinal neuronal (retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell–inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL)) and microvascular (arterioles and venules) measures were used as predictors. Outcome measures were four top ADRD risk indexes (CAIDE, LIBRA, Lancet, and ADU-ADRI), and a comprehensive midlife ADRD risk index, the DunedinARB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poorer retinal microvascular health (narrower arterioles and wider venules) was associated with greater ADRD risk (βs = 0.16–0.31; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;s &amp;lt; 0.001). Thinner RNFL was modestly associated with higher ADRD risk (βs = 0.05–0.08; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;s = 0.02–0.13). Follow-up tests of distinct domains of ADRD risk indicated that while RNFL associations reflected cardiometabolic risk only, microvascular measures were associated with diverse ADRD risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measures of retinal health, particularly microvascular measures, successfully capture ADRD risk across several domains of known risk factors, even at the young midlife age of 45 years. Retinal microvascular imaging may be an accessible, scalable, and relatively low-cost method of assessing ADRD risk among middle-aged adults.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 13:40:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE1uejlzTm9TbGZKX09FTDByS3o4dHY3TUNqdWFmSlpKNnZvRWJqZlpwTFNCUXlldVdPVTJEMTh3Q1ptRVlrYlFYNXhHeUlYOG9LeDBKSEp1T3EtRG8yY3hFTWlqLVEwc3RJdmdwOVpn</guid></item><item><title>'Fingerprints of cancer' found after scientists flash infrared light pulses at blood samples - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizAFBVV95cUxPZXlpRjZSbGppeUM1OHdqSFpvZlg3RW5ObTd5TUNEeXZ3MU9YcUl3VUpFOVRwUHpmVkJmb080UC04LTVVX0h6NzIzRF9VVnFpQUN0eVRBcUpoX3pPRGc3Ump2NndrREpLWG5Xb1hQUkV1bmhUdk03QjJRWHFkMVluSnRKSGVoMVZla2RsNEhldkFnVHBtaXE0MU4tWmV1V0hpWWhHNEtWUERsSWJnck9YQzNaSzQ5bS1reWVET3F0dGdockVrbVl1dDg0MVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flashes of infrared light can detect signs of cancer in a patient's blood, new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, scientists demonstrated that a test using infrared light can detect the difference between blood samples from patients with lung cancer and samples from those without the disease with up to 81% accuracy. They presented their findings in a study published April 9 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.4c02164" target="_blank" data-url="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.4c02164" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ACS Central Science&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new test is powered by &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/what-is-artificial-intelligence-ai" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/what-is-artificial-intelligence-ai"&gt;&lt;u&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (AI) and examines differences in molecules found in blood plasma, the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;watery portion of blood&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that carries various proteins and chemical compounds — such as hormones and vitamins — around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When blood samples are exposed to flashes of infrared light from a laser, the molecules held within the plasma vibrate. In turn, different components of the molecules absorb or reflect the energy from the light pulses, and consequently, they emit their own distinctive pattern of light that can be recorded and read as an "infrared molecular fingerprint."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/detecting-cancer-in-minutes-possible-with-just-a-drop-of-dried-blood-and-new-test-study-hints" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/detecting-cancer-in-minutes-possible-with-just-a-drop-of-dried-blood-and-new-test-study-hints"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detecting cancer in minutes possible with just a drop of dried blood and new test, study hints&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fingerprint differs between patients with cancer and those without the disease, the researchers reported.

This cohort included patients with lung, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/45406-prostate-cancer.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/45406-prostate-cancer.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;prostate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34706-breast-cancer-symptoms-treatment-prevention.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34706-breast-cancer-symptoms-treatment-prevention.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;breast&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or bladder cancer who had not yet been treated for their disease. For each patient with cancer, the researchers showed the AI a blood sample from a person of the same sex and of a similar age who didn't have cancer, for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After training their AI model using these data, the researchers tested how accurate it was at identifying cancer fingerprints in the plasma of about 430 people who weren't included in the initial data. The researchers found that the model was up to 81% accurate at discerning plasma samples from patients with lung cancer compared with those from individuals without the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the model was much less successful at detecting the other three types of cancer included in the study. For example, the model only detected around 50% of breast cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering these limitations of the test, much more research will be needed before it could ever be used in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the researchers behind the test are hopeful about its prospects. They now plan to train the model on a wider range of cancers, using data from more patients, to see if they can improve its accuracy in detecting cancer. They especially want to hone its ability to detect cancer at different stages of the disease, they said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While the review did not explore mechanistic pathways directly, prior research has pointed to several plausible biological explanations. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers synthesized decades of global data to better understand how maternal diabetes may influence the developing fetal brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results paint a consistent and concerning picture: even after adjusting for major confounding variables such as socioeconomic status, maternal age, and birth complications, maternal diabetes remained robustly associated with a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sweeping Review, Striking Consistency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The systematic review and meta-analysis, registered in PROSPERO and spanning four major research databases, included studies published up to December 2024. Collectively, these studies followed over 56 million mother–child pairs, making this the largest and most comprehensive investigation of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In studies that adjusted for multiple confounding factors, children exposed to maternal diabetes were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28% more likely&lt;/strong&gt; to be diagnosed with &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; neurodevelopmental disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25% more likely&lt;/strong&gt; to be diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30% more likely&lt;/strong&gt; to be diagnosed with ADHD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32% more likely&lt;/strong&gt; to have intellectual disabilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16–20% more likely&lt;/strong&gt; to be diagnosed with learning, communication, or motor disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern held whether the diabetes was gestational (developing during pregnancy) or pre-gestational (existing prior to pregnancy). However, the risk was markedly higher for pre-gestational diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children exposed to pre-gestational diabetes had a 39% increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, compared to an 18% increased risk among those exposed to gestational diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurodevelopmental Effects Extend Beyond Diagnoses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to clinical diagnoses, children born to mothers with diabetes also showed significantly lower average scores in measures of intelligence and psychomotor development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These deficits, though variable, suggest that the impact of maternal diabetes may extend well beyond formal diagnostic thresholds, affecting a range of cognitive and motor functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of the studies included in the analysis—84%—focused on outcomes in children and adolescents up to the age of 18, providing a long-term view of how early exposures may shape brain function across childhood and adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanisms and Limitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the review did not explore mechanistic pathways directly, prior research has pointed to several plausible biological explanations. These include altered glucose and insulin levels in utero, increased oxidative stress, chronic low-grade inflammation, and epigenetic changes—all of which can interfere with critical periods of fetal brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, while this meta-analysis demonstrates a strong association, it does not establish causality. The authors caution that additional high-quality, prospective studies are needed to clarify the biological mechanisms at play and disentangle the contributions of genetics, environment, and prenatal metabolic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the consistency of the findings across dozens of studies, populations, and methodologies lends considerable weight to the conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Health Implications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the global rise in diabetes and gestational diabetes rates—driven in part by increasing maternal age and obesity—the findings carry major public health implications. Early identification and monitoring of children born to diabetic mothers may allow for timely intervention, potentially improving cognitive and developmental outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the results may inform clinical care guidelines, encouraging tighter glycemic control before and during pregnancy and prompting clinicians to counsel expectant mothers more thoroughly about potential neurodevelopmental risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Call for Continued Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the strength of the evidence, much remains unknown. Are some neurodevelopmental disorders more sensitive to metabolic disruptions than others? Does the timing of diabetic onset in pregnancy matter? Can interventions during gestation mitigate these risks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors argue that future research should not only explore these questions but also examine potential protective factors and interventions that could buffer developing brains from the effects of maternal metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, this research adds urgency to a growing body of literature emphasizing the lifelong consequences of maternal health during pregnancy—not just for mothers, but for their children’s developing brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this gestational diabetes and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/about-neuroscience-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-8587(25)00036-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Association between maternal diabetes and neurodevelopmental outcomes in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 202 observational studies comprising 56·1 million pregnancies&lt;/a&gt;” by Wenrui Ye et al. &lt;em&gt;Lancet Diabetes &amp;amp; Endocrinology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Association between maternal diabetes and neurodevelopmental outcomes in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 202 observational studies comprising 56·1 million pregnancies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maternal diabetes might alter fetal brain development. However, well-designed systematic analyses are needed to comprehensively assess and quantify the association between maternal diabetes and neurodevelopmental outcomes in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aimed to synthesise and evaluate the available evidence on the effects of maternal diabetes on neurodevelopmental outcomes in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and EBSCO databases from inception to Dec 1, 2024, for studies exploring neurodevelopmental outcomes of children born to mothers with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary outcome was neurodevelopmental disorders, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition and International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision. Data were extracted from published reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data were pooled with random-effects models and presented as risk ratios or standard mean differences with 95% CIs. This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023395464).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;202 studies, involving 56 082 462 mother–child pairs, were included in the meta-analysis. Of these, 110 (54%) examined gestational diabetes, while 80 (40%) investigated pre-gestational diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the total studies reviewed, 169 (84%) exclusively focused on children and adolescents aged up to 18 years. In studies adjusting for at least one key confounder, maternal diabetes was associated with increased risks of all types of neurodevelopmental disorders as well as lower intelligence and psychomotor scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In studies adjusting for multiple confounders (n=98, 49%), children exposed to maternal diabetes had an increased risk of any neurodevelopmental disorder (risk ratio 1·28; 95% CI 1·24–1·31), autism spectrum disorder (1·25; 1·20–1·31), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (1·30; 1·24–1·37), intellectual disability (1·32; 1·18–1·47), specific developmental disorders (1·27; 1·17–1·37), communication disorder (1·20; 1·11–1·28), motor disorder (1·17; 1·10–1·26), and learning disorder (1·16; 1·06–1·26), compared with unexposed children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maternal pre-gestational diabetes was more strongly associated with the risk of most neurodevelopmental disorders in children than gestational diabetes (risk ratio 1·39; [95% CI 1·34–1·44] &lt;em&gt;vs&lt;/em&gt; 1·18 [1·14–1·23]; subgroup difference p&amp;lt;0·0001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maternal diabetes is associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders and impaired neurodevelopmental performance in children.

The experts point out that melting ice opens the region to more people and industries. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/arctic-warming-permafrost-melt-devastating-role-accelerating-global-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Warmer temperatures&lt;/a&gt; also unlock dangerous microbes that have slept frozen for millennia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-arctic-warming-could-unlock-diseases"&gt;Arctic warming could unlock diseases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team focused on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/permafrost-thaw-is-a-rising-threat-to-arctic-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;permafrost&lt;/a&gt;, the once-permanently frozen soil that covers vast parts of the Arctic. As the planet heats, permafrost thaws and releases ancient microorganisms from dead animals or other organic material long trapped in ice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If reactivated, these pathogens could threaten Arctic wildlife and local communities. In some cases, diseases could emerge that have never seen by modern humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Khaled Megahed Abass of the &lt;a href="https://www.sharjah.ac.ae/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Sharjah&lt;/a&gt;, a co-author of the study, the consequences could be severe. “Permafrost thawing could even release ancient bacteria or viruses that have been frozen for thousands of years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists compiled evidence from academic studies and government documents across Canada, Alaska, Greenland, and northern Europe. Their findings reveal that the Arctic is changing more rapidly than most other parts of the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warmer temperatures and melting sea ice draw industries like shipping, mining, and tourism ever northward. While this brings economic opportunities, it also puts more people in contact with long-dormant microbes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-infections-could-spread-globally"&gt;New infections could spread globally&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Climate change in the Arctic might seem like a distant concern. The authors, however, stress that its effects can travel far beyond extreme northern environments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new infection emerging in a remote corner can spread rapidly through human travel or wildlife migrations. As Abass warned, “What is happening in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The region’s transformation has ripple effects, from Arctic warming that touches every coastal city worldwide to shifting atmospheric patterns that can influence global weather. These conditions also disrupt local ecosystems, making animal-to-human pathogen transfer more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review shows that the health of the Arctic ecosystem is deeply connected to the health of global communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As new shipping lanes open, trade routes shorten. More tourists arrive and transport microbes to new host cities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially worrying because diseases that cross the animal-human boundary – known as zoonotic diseases – have been responsible for major outbreaks, including &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/abzymes-new-discovery-cause-long-covid-symptoms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-arctic-warming-and-disease-risks"&gt;Arctic warming and disease risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study emphasizes the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/one-health#tab=tab_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;One Health&lt;/a&gt; approach, which views people, animals, plants, and the environment as part of one interconnected system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists argue that monitoring animal health in Arctic warming conditions is necessary to spot diseases before they spread to human populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also call for greater cooperation among veterinarians, environmental agencies, and public health professionals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By watching Arctic wildlife, testing water sources, and educating local communities on disease risk, it’s possible to get an early warning of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/the-infectious-disease-landscape-is-changing-and-we-must-prepare/"&gt;infectious threats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study shows how Arctic residents – many Indigenous peoples – can offer vital insights. Their traditional knowledge and everyday observations detect shifts in animal behavior before any official monitoring program picks up signs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tapping into this localized expertise would boost prevention and response measures. Ultimately, it would help safeguard people, wildlife, and the broader environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-thawing-permafrost-prompts-swift-action"&gt;Thawing permafrost prompts swift action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these looming risks, the authors note that crucial information is lacking. There are gaps in monitoring and current knowledge, particularly in how emerging pathogens might behave under Arctic conditions or spread through newly thawed soil and water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their review also underscores the need for stronger disease surveillance systems to ensure that any outbreak can be swiftly detected and contained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments, public health agencies, and local industries must coordinate to identify high-risk areas and vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Abass, many non-academic groups, such as northern industries and public health organizations, are starting to pay attention to these issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policymakers and business leaders are concerned about mitigating risks and keeping Arctic operations safe, especially as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/we-can-prevent-future-pandemics-by-protecting-nature/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pandemic prevention&lt;/a&gt; becomes a global priority. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope this momentum will encourage more robust safety measures and environmental stewardship in the far north. They also stress that Arctic warming could foreshadow similar problems in other regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ancient-pathogens-in-unexpected-places"&gt;Ancient pathogens in unexpected places&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thawing in Siberia or high-altitude glaciers could reveal microbes that have not circulated for thousands of years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If humans continue altering the climate, we may face repeated discoveries of ancient pathogens in unexpected places. Such an emergency would send health systems scrambling to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists view Arctic warming as both a warning and an opportunity. Communities can adapt to this new reality through surveillance, interdisciplinary research, and Indigenous knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes rethinking development projects in places where permafrost once provided a natural disease barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With solid planning and early interventions, the global community can reduce the risk of new outbreaks and protect one of the most fragile regions on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969724070268?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science of the Total Environment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-ralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 12:49:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOTXJnWlA2RjZsRHJRTmNRTXEwX0R0cEVSdkZlb3l5YzRDVVkyU1hMbjlNeTRvSHRwUUpfd1dqSnI0dmJoOUtUSFVLRTljUVpDSGg4QTZ5TmZBdmJ1ZjZXNlU2NEJid0lxaDlyUXBrNDNfVGcwOERCZ01LaHdVM1JWaG90NWpndHJJMmJxZWVienAtaDZTbXJDS0k1YzhQNDAwd2FSUHhR</guid></item><item><title>CREB3 protein identified as potential treatment target in ALS - ALS News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOZ3lFTGJJdm5VTS1kMG5VTWFIVEFicDBqUERybTdZSUJpQnFhMHB1dlRsdTJIZjVDUzFsWDJmNkoxNVZzMGxvMkdzWXZPbHAxdTItcVN6Nk5kOF8xYjhteS1pdTN4YndmV1NtSldlUzJfWmFWeDVaWEpvZ3JaZmxvZTh1X19QbTZWYnJ3WEQ2QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rare mutation that leads to abnormally high activity of the CREB3 protein is associated with a reduced risk of developing &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/what-is-als/"&gt;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (ALS) and people with ALS who carry this mutation progress significantly more slowly and live longer than those who don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s according to the study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58098-6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;CREB3 gain of function variants protect against ALS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” which was published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings imply “that boosting CREB3 activity could represent an interesting therapeutic strategy to prevent disease onset or slow down disease progression,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the neurodegenerative disease ALS, the nerve cells that control voluntary movement, called motor neurons, become damaged and die. The biological mechanisms that drive motor neuron damage in ALS aren’t fully understood, but it’s now known that the genetic activity of certain nerve cells becomes disrupted in ALS, likely contributing to that damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CREB3 is a transcription factor — a protein that helps control which genes are turned on or off inside cells. The protein helps control the activity of a particular network of genes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Zeroing in on the CREB3 protein&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, researchers conducted detailed cell by cell analyses of brain samples from people who’d died of ALS, which were cross-referenced against data from mouse models of the disease. Through these analyses, the researchers hoped to pinpoint specific networks of genes that were dysregulated in the nerve cells that are most vulnerable to damage in ALS and zeroed in on the network regulated by CREB3 as likely involved in the disease. This prompted them to look deeper into the role the protein may play in ALS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all proteins, CREB3 is built of a chain of building blocks called amino acids. In most people, a specific amino acid called arginine (abbreviated, R) is present at the 119th position in the chain that makes up CREB3. But some people have a mutation that causes glycine (G), a different amino acid, to be at this position. This mutation is referred to as R119G.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed genetic data from 1,873 ALS patients and 3,926 people without the disease, and found that the R119G variant was nearly twice as common among people without ALS, which suggests that people who carry the mutation are less likely to develop the disease. Statistically, the R119G variant was associated with a 39% lower chance of developing ALS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then looked at outcomes for ALS patients who did or did not carry this variant. They found that people who carry the R119G variant live nearly a year longer on average than those without it (55.5 months vs. 43.9 months). Disease progression was also significantly slower in patients who carried the variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Overall, this data confirms that the R119G mutation has a protective role in ALS and demonstrates that ALS patients that do carry the variant have a significantly slower rate of motor progression and increased mean disease duration,” wrote the researchers, who also looked at how the R119G variant effects CREB3’s activity as a transcription factor. They found that the protein carrying this variant is substantially more active than the normal version, leading to greater activation of the gene network it regulates. “Thus, the CREB3 R119G variant confers protection against ALS via a higher … activation of its target genes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists said the data suggest that activating CREB3 could be a useful therapeutic approach for ALS treatment, but more research is needed to validate the results and better understand CREB3’s role in nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ALS News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 12:42:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOZ3lFTGJJdm5VTS1kMG5VTWFIVEFicDBqUERybTdZSUJpQnFhMHB1dlRsdTJIZjVDUzFsWDJmNkoxNVZzMGxvMkdzWXZPbHAxdTItcVN6Nk5kOF8xYjhteS1pdTN4YndmV1NtSldlUzJfWmFWeDVaWEpvZ3JaZmxvZTh1X19QbTZWYnJ3WEQ2QQ</guid></item><item><title>How mushrooms bolster your immune system and protect your brain - The Telegraph</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNTE40Y05xd3hjZEphMno0OUtfYVdzTTNRS1c1SXljZFFtU21faFp3cDRzcUlSaUJ6cUVHX0pnVzUtODFZVnc5LW5zUDRfZWh5VkNIYk5vRzhBNVVVb3YwcVhzMFQ1N1VoenFVcjBWTWpWU2hQRWxibERhSUlQTE80b2stVVRsV2VuZndoTEZjWVlYRFBxX1NMcWk2aGtSZ0lkUHFJMDhLZzAzb0ZsczJTRmZ3a0JreC00?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;They can boost the immune system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mushrooms have cell walls which are rich in various forms of a type of fibre called beta-glucan. The &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recipes/entertaining/chinese-new-year/stir-fried-shiitake-mushrooms-lettuce-oyster-sauce-recipe/"&gt;shiitake mushroom&lt;/a&gt;, for example, contains a beta-glucan called lentinan which has attracted considerable attention over the years for its immune-boosting properties. One of the reasons for this is because when these beta-glucans are broken down by microbes in the gut, they increase the production of a range of useful metabolites called short-chain fatty acids which can help regulate the immune system in various positive ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The beta-glucans in mushrooms appear to have prebiotic effects, supporting the growth of friendly [gut] bacteria,” says Dr Daniel Commane, an associate professor at Northumbria University, who has previously conducted research on mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Commane also points out that some of the beta-glucans present in mushrooms are very similar to sugar molecules called glucans, which are present within the many diverse fungi which are permanent residents of our gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that our gut fungi communicate on a constant basis with the immune system, an ongoing chatter which is facilitated by glucans. This communication is critical to maintaining immune balance, and if it breaks down, we’re at a greater risk of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/diabetes/the-dangers-of-chronic-inflammation-and-how-to-reduce-it/"&gt;inflammatory diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, Dr Commane says that one of the theories for why eating mushrooms could be good for your immune system, is because the various beta-glucans they contain helps support this “cross-talk” between gut fungi and immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is very much an ongoing area of study, with evidence emerging to suggest that consuming glucans [through mushrooms] may help protect against things like cold and flu,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;They may help with cognitive decline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a little more speculative, but last year, a paper from the University of Reading’s nutritional sciences department highlighted some studies showing that consuming various mushrooms could hold benefits for &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/foods-brain-health/"&gt;cognitive health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Ellen Smith, a researcher at Northumbria University, the strongest evidence for any health benefits is related to &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/supplements/lions-mane-mushroom-benefits-side-effects/"&gt;lion’s mane mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;. This is based on work on animals and in test tubes, but also a handful of small trials which have identified a reduction in anxiety and depression in some people, as well as improvements in cognitive decline in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s thought that mushrooms feed beneficial gut bacteria, which in turn has a positive impact on the brain. Different species of mushrooms also contain various bioactive chemicals. Widely available white button mushrooms, for example, contain bioactives called ergosterols, oyster mushrooms contain ergothioneine and lion’s mane mushrooms contain hericenones and erinacines. Each of these chemicals may be capable of exerting their own protective effects on the brain, either directly or indirectly, based on the findings of test tube studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we look at the existing limited research, there are numerous different mechanisms that might mean lion’s mane can enhance nerve growth factor [which facilitates the growth of nerve cells in the brain], exert an anti-inflammatory effect [in the brain], and modulate gut microbial composition,” says Smith. “In younger adults, emerging evidence tentatively suggests some improvements in cognitive task performances, such as quicker reaction times and some changes to mood scores. However, the evidence is still limited when it comes to determining the efficacy of lion’s mane.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Should you go for supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, it’s only possible to buy certain mushroom species like lion’s mane, from specialist growers such as Merit Mushrooms. So should you opt for one of the many widely available supplements instead?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Medicinal mushrooms like turkey tail, lion’s mane, reishi, cordyceps and chaga have received research interest thanks to their potential health benefits,” says Eva Humphries. “With the exception of online orders for lion’s mane, these mushrooms are not readily available in supermarkets, so supplemental forms are the only option.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is am whole universe of mushroom powders, coffees and gummies, flourishing on TikTok and other social media outlets, Humphries says it is important to bear in mind that there are currently no permissible health claims relating to medicinal mushroom supplements under EU regulations, due to lack of evidence. And if you’re buying supplements, it’s best to opt for a company which specifically says that they batch-test for heavy metals and toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mushrooms naturally accumulate heavy metals such as arsenic and cadmium which are associated with negative health consequences,” says Humphries. “At present, there are no requirements to batch-test mushroom powders for heavy metals, but luckily some supplement companies do this voluntarily.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The best ways to eat mushrooms, according to nutritionist Eva Humphries&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past psychology research suggests that different people display characteristic patterns of spontaneous thought, emotions and behaviors. These patterns make the brains of distinct individuals unique, to the point that neuroscientists can often tell them apart based on their neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at McGill University, University of Cambridge and other institutes recently carried out a study aimed at investigating how general anesthesia influences the unique neural activity signatures that characterize the brains of different people and animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02121-9" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/i&gt;, show that general anesthesia suppresses each brain's unique functional connectivity patterns (i.e., the connections and communication patterns between different regions of the brain), both in humans and other species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Every person is unique, they think and feel and act in unique ways," Andrea Luppi, first author of the paper, told Medical Xpress. "This uniqueness comes from our brain. The way that areas of the brain interact with each other is unique to each individual: it can be used like a 'brain fingerprint.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But when you lose consciousness, for example during &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/deep+sleep/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;deep sleep&lt;/a&gt;, your sense of being 'you' is gone. So, our question was: what happens to brain fingerprints when we lose consciousness, such as during the artificial sleep induced by general anesthesia? "&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the effects of anesthesia on the brain's functional connectivity patterns, Luppi and his colleagues employed an imaging technique commonly used in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neuroscience+research/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neuroscience research&lt;/a&gt; called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This technique allows neuroscientists to monitor the activity of different &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+regions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain regions&lt;/a&gt; over time and non-invasively, by measuring changes in blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"We collected fMRI scans from healthy human volunteers before general anesthesia, then when they were unconscious because of the anesthesia, and then again after they recovered consciousness," explained Luppi. "For each scan, we measured 'functional connectivity': a representation of how brain regions interact. We used this functional connectivity to obtain 'brain fingerprints,' telling us how easy or difficult it is to tell people apart based on their &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the fMRI scans collected by the researchers showed that the brain activity of people while they were under the influence of anesthesia was suppressed. In fact, anesthesia made people almost impossible to tell apart from each other solely by examining their brain activity, which was possible when they were still conscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In contrast, using brain fingerprints it is very easy to tell people apart when they are conscious," said Luppi. "This effect is not uniform in the brain: it is strongest in the parts of the brain that are uniquely human and mostly distinguish us from other species. The implication is that just as your own conscious experience is unique to you, so are the brain patterns that support it. When consciousness is gone, people's brain activity is also less unique."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luppi and his colleagues gathered interesting new insights about the effects of general anesthesia on the brain and its unique patterns of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural activity&lt;/a&gt;. In the future, the results of their study could inspire further cross-species research looking at the brain before, during and after the administration of anesthetics, which could in turn inform the development of interventions to facilitate the rehabilitation of both people and animals after medical procedures that require anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I am very interested in comparisons between humans and other species," added Luppi. "Anesthesia is very conserved across species, so we can learn a lot from them about how anesthesia works on the brain. Ultimately, I hope that by learning how the brain reboots consciousness after &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/anesthesia/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;anesthesia&lt;/a&gt;, we can learn how to help recovery of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/consciousness/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt; in patients who suffer from coma and other forms of chronic unconsciousness after a brain injury."&lt;/p&gt;

         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vdc6000v2cnr5sj304yp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The use of drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy and Zepbound in people with type 1 diabetes has risen sharply over the past decade, a new study finds, even though there’s little information on the drugs’ safety and effectiveness for the condition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b00032e6b6fm6vmh1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The family of medications called GLP-1 receptor agonists includes drugs like Wegovy, Zepbound, Ozempic, Mounjaro and Victoza. They were originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, which happens when the body’s cells become resistant to the hormone insulin. Some of them have also been&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;found to be safe and effective to help with weight loss, to treat sleep apnea and to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in people who don’t have diabetes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b00042e6bnjin5nhs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183" target="_blank"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2206038" target="_blank"&gt;these medications&lt;/a&gt; specifically excluded people with type 1 diabetes, who are dependent on the hormone insulin to survive because they can’t make enough of their own. Drugmakers feared that using the GLP-1 medications with insulin might raise the chance of dangerously low blood sugar events, or hypoglycemia, and were unwilling to take the risk of studying them in people with type 1.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm93b0jmv00042e6bd8e8u1oc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The medication labels for &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2023/209637s020s021lbl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2022/215866s000lbl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt;, which are prescribed to help people with type 2 diabetes manage blood sugar, specifically say they are not intended for use with type 1.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm93aor4z00002e6be2gplocn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, despite the lack of evidence, many doctors began prescribing GLP-1 medications off-label for their type 1 patients, especially those who also have obesity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b00062e6bzo6yvflk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study reflects this growing practice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b00072e6bswtl795f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For &lt;a href="https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/dom.16300" target="_blank"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt;, which was published last month in the journal Diabetes, Obesity, and Metabolism&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;researchers at Johns Hopkins University reviewed the medical records of more than 200,000 people with type 1 diabetes from 2008 to 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b00082e6bvc09ec2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They grouped the data in three-year periods, starting with October 2008 to September 2011 and ending with October 2020 to September 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b00092e6bg35t0ifh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Over these periods, obesity rates increased substantially among people with type 1 diabetes. Among children ages 2 to 19, obesity rates climbed from 18% to 26%, and they rose from 30% to 38% among adults 20 and older.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000a2e6b4doukphc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            GLP-1 medication use spiked, as well. Among adults with the highest category of obesity, about 4% used GLP-1 medications in 2008, and 33% did by 2023 – an 800% increase.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000b2e6bh91jvkt0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some people with type 1 say these drugs have been game-changers, helping them gain control of wild blood sugar swings for the first time. They can also help type 1 diabetes patients lose weight, something that’s especially difficult for people who take insulin, which signals the body to take extra sugar out of the blood and store it as fat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000c2e6bxt86cx05@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But these are anecdotal reports and may not reflect instances in which people have side effects or complications like low blood sugar, which can be life-threatening.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000d2e6bmf1xwu8q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We really need the clinical trial data dedicated for this type 1 diabetes population and see whether this is effective and safe in this population,” said study author Dr. Jung-Im Shin, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000e2e6bal7j2r30@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Smaller retrospective studies – those that look back in time – suggest that there are benefits to using GLP-1 medications with type 1 diabetes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000f2e6bskl9uqim@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Shin says what’s really needed is information from randomized, double-blinded studies, in which participants are followed forward in time and given either a drug or a placebo.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000g2e6br97nizai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some of that data is coming soon, says Dr. Viral Shah, an endocrinologist and director of diabetes clinical research at the Indiana University School of Medicine who was not involved in the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000h2e6bwodimznc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Shah says that, like many of his colleagues, he prescribes GLP-1 medications for certain type 1 patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000i2e6b2wpoinr6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most endocrinologists nowadays do understand that people with type 1 diabetes – not everyone, but some, would benefit” from a second medication&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;along with their insulin. In addition to GLP-1 medications, a class of medications used in type 2 diabetes called SGLT-2 inhibitors is also being studied for use with type 1 diabetes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000j2e6bp5c0el00@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            GLP-1 drugs can help lower the amount of insulin a person requires to control their blood sugar and may help people who have type 1 and obesity to lose weight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000k2e6bpnccod7l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because of the risk of low blood sugar, Shah says, it’s really important to work with a doctor on dosing of both the GLP-1 and insulin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000l2e6bbpto65n1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Shah says he would caution people with type 1 who are not overweight to avoid taking a GLP-1 drug, since retrospective studies have found that this group tends to have more gastrointestinal side effects, which may lead them to stop using the drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000m2e6b32vt49rt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Several ongoing studies are looking at the use of GLP-1 medications in type 1 diabetes, Shah says, including one he led, which will be presented in at the American Diabetes Association’s annual meeting in June.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000n2e6b49zxo9v4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Shah’s &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05537233" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which included people who had type 1 and obesity, was a randomized, double-blinded study in patients who use an artificial pancreas to control their blood sugar. An artificial pancreas is a system that uses a computer to deliver insulin based on real-time blood sugar readings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Half of the participants got a weekly shot of semaglutide, the drug in Ozempic and Wegovy, while the other half got a placebo injection. The participants were followed for a total of six months.

    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vdc6000v2cnr5sj304yp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The use of drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy and Zepbound in people with type 1 diabetes has risen sharply over the past decade, a new study finds, even though there’s little information on the drugs’ safety and effectiveness for the condition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b00032e6b6fm6vmh1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The family of medications called GLP-1 receptor agonists includes drugs like Wegovy, Zepbound, Ozempic, Mounjaro and Victoza. They were originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, which happens when the body’s cells become resistant to the hormone insulin. Some of them have also been&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;found to be safe and effective to help with weight loss, to treat sleep apnea and to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in people who don’t have diabetes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b00042e6bnjin5nhs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183" target="_blank"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2206038" target="_blank"&gt;these medications&lt;/a&gt; specifically excluded people with type 1 diabetes, who are dependent on the hormone insulin to survive because they can’t make enough of their own. Drugmakers feared that using the GLP-1 medications with insulin might raise the chance of dangerously low blood sugar events, or hypoglycemia, and were unwilling to take the risk of studying them in people with type 1.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm93b0jmv00042e6bd8e8u1oc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The medication labels for &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2023/209637s020s021lbl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2022/215866s000lbl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt;, which are prescribed to help people with type 2 diabetes manage blood sugar, specifically say they are not intended for use with type 1.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm93aor4z00002e6be2gplocn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, despite the lack of evidence, many doctors began prescribing GLP-1 medications off-label for their type 1 patients, especially those who also have obesity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b00062e6bzo6yvflk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study reflects this growing practice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b00072e6bswtl795f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For &lt;a href="https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/dom.16300" target="_blank"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt;, which was published last month in the journal Diabetes, Obesity, and Metabolism&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;researchers at Johns Hopkins University reviewed the medical records of more than 200,000 people with type 1 diabetes from 2008 to 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b00082e6bvc09ec2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They grouped the data in three-year periods, starting with October 2008 to September 2011 and ending with October 2020 to September 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b00092e6bg35t0ifh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Over these periods, obesity rates increased substantially among people with type 1 diabetes. Among children ages 2 to 19, obesity rates climbed from 18% to 26%, and they rose from 30% to 38% among adults 20 and older.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000a2e6b4doukphc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            GLP-1 medication use spiked, as well. Among adults with the highest category of obesity, about 4% used GLP-1 medications in 2008, and 33% did by 2023 – an 800% increase.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000b2e6bh91jvkt0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some people with type 1 say these drugs have been game-changers, helping them gain control of wild blood sugar swings for the first time. They can also help type 1 diabetes patients lose weight, something that’s especially difficult for people who take insulin, which signals the body to take extra sugar out of the blood and store it as fat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000c2e6bxt86cx05@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But these are anecdotal reports and may not reflect instances in which people have side effects or complications like low blood sugar, which can be life-threatening.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000d2e6bmf1xwu8q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We really need the clinical trial data dedicated for this type 1 diabetes population and see whether this is effective and safe in this population,” said study author Dr. Jung-Im Shin, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000e2e6bal7j2r30@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Smaller retrospective studies – those that look back in time – suggest that there are benefits to using GLP-1 medications with type 1 diabetes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000f2e6bskl9uqim@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Shin says what’s really needed is information from randomized, double-blinded studies, in which participants are followed forward in time and given either a drug or a placebo.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000g2e6br97nizai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some of that data is coming soon, says Dr. Viral Shah, an endocrinologist and director of diabetes clinical research at the Indiana University School of Medicine who was not involved in the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000h2e6bwodimznc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Shah says that, like many of his colleagues, he prescribes GLP-1 medications for certain type 1 patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000i2e6b2wpoinr6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most endocrinologists nowadays do understand that people with type 1 diabetes – not everyone, but some, would benefit” from a second medication&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;along with their insulin. In addition to GLP-1 medications, a class of medications used in type 2 diabetes called SGLT-2 inhibitors is also being studied for use with type 1 diabetes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000j2e6bp5c0el00@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            GLP-1 drugs can help lower the amount of insulin a person requires to control their blood sugar and may help people who have type 1 and obesity to lose weight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000k2e6bpnccod7l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because of the risk of low blood sugar, Shah says, it’s really important to work with a doctor on dosing of both the GLP-1 and insulin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000l2e6bbpto65n1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Shah says he would caution people with type 1 who are not overweight to avoid taking a GLP-1 drug, since retrospective studies have found that this group tends to have more gastrointestinal side effects, which may lead them to stop using the drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000m2e6b32vt49rt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Several ongoing studies are looking at the use of GLP-1 medications in type 1 diabetes, Shah says, including one he led, which will be presented in at the American Diabetes Association’s annual meeting in June.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm937vl7b000n2e6b49zxo9v4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Shah’s &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05537233" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which included people who had type 1 and obesity, was a randomized, double-blinded study in patients who use an artificial pancreas to control their blood sugar. An artificial pancreas is a system that uses a computer to deliver insulin based on real-time blood sugar readings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm938blxd00013b6oba258xhf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Half of the participants got a weekly shot of semaglutide, the drug in Ozempic and Wegovy, while the other half got a placebo injection. The participants were followed for a total of six months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. publicly urged people to get the measles vaccine in an interview with CBS News on Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm99sydgg00033b6mpg3figcq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We encourage people to get the measles vaccine,” Kennedy told the network’s chief medical correspondent, Dr. Jon LaPook.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm99sydgg00043b6m46uy0vjx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The federal government’s position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine, but the government should not be mandating those,” Kennedy said. “I always said during my campaign — and every part, every public statement I’ve made — I’m not gonna take people’s vaccines away from them. What I’m gonna do is make sure that we have good science so that people can make an informed choice.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm99sybk300013b6moxks3th2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A measles outbreak spanning multiple states is nearing 600 cases, and experts say it might just be the beginning.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm99328mk00033b5v2lyy0mbh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As of Tuesday, Texas has reported 505 cases associated with the outbreak, New Mexico has reported 56 cases, and Oklahoma has reported 10: eight confirmed and two probable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm99328mk00043b5vsixcyv7a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cases in Kansas, which the state health department says may also be linked to the outbreak, reached &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2314/Measles-Data" target="_blank"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt; last week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm99328mk00023b5v55yp9p3v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The outbreak began in rural Gaines County, Texas, where most of the cases are concentrated, but Tuesday’s update shows spread into 21 Texas counties. Local officials are particularly worried about spread of the measles virus into new areas and vulnerable populations, such as urban centers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm99328mk00053b5v04txz1wg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m worried about exposures in grocery stores, malls and those types of places that don’t exist as much out in the rural community,” Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health, said Tuesday. “You have a much bigger population, so one case can be exposing a lot more individuals.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm99328mk00063b5vhyvbft8n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In these areas, public health workers will need to do more to figure out who is at risk, who is exposed and who needs to isolate, she said. Some local health departments have said that recent cuts to funding from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will hinder their epidemiology work and lab capacity for identifying measles cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm99328mk00083b5vtj4srg1h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Lubbock, measles exposure in a day care center has resulted in seven cases in children under the age of 5, Wells said Tuesday. This is a particularly vulnerable community, as many of the children are not old enough to get their second dose of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9937amp00003b6ol322qi4n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Under normal circumstances, the CDC recommends one dose of MMR between 12 to 15 months of age and another between 4 and 6 years. In outbreak situations, these guidelines may be updated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm99328mk00093b5vku7kuvnv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our biggest challenge right now is really around younger children,” Wells said. “One of my biggest concerns was outbreaks in places where we have vulnerable individuals, individuals that can’t be vaccinated yet, or children that are undervaccinated because they’re only eligible for that one vaccine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The local health department is encouraging vaccination for other children at the day care center, in line with recommendations from the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/health-alert-texas-2025-measles-outbreak-expanded-outbreak-counties" target="_blank"&gt;Texas Department of Health Services&lt;/a&gt; that children ages 1 to 4 in the outbreak area get their second dose as soon as possible, as long as it’s at least 28 days after their first dose.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm993eaou00043b6o4n96qeuj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Infants who are 6 to 11 months in the outbreak area can get an early dose of the MMR vaccine and will then resume the normal MMR schedule with two more doses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Given the contagious nature of the virus and low vaccination rates in many pockets of the country, experts expect the outbreak to grow, possibly for more than a year. Continued spread of the virus for more than 12 months could threaten the measles elimination status the US earned in 2000, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html#:~:text=Key%20points%20*%20In%20the%209th%20century%2C,measles%20elimination%20status%20for%20over%2020%20years." target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I think it is going to be something that really pushes us to the deadline for elimination for the United States, as well as for the Americas,” Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm99328mk000d3b5vfam3xntd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Compared with other recent US outbreaks, cases are vastly undercounted in this outbreak, he said, in part because it has been concentrated in a Mennonite population that is undervaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm99328mk000e3b5vpj4jed30@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There might be reticence to get tested in some of those areas, [which] probably means that this is a lot bigger than the outbreaks that we’ve seen in the past,” Adalja said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm99328mk000f3b5vkuia5q83@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Three deaths have been connected with the outbreak: two school-age children in Texas and an adult in New Mexico whose death remains under investigation. All of these people were unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There have been at least 659 measles cases this year, according to a CNN tally. Data from the CDC shows that there are usually &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/downloads/measlesdataandstatsslideset.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;1 or 2 deaths for every 1,000&lt;/a&gt; cases of measles. The number of deaths in this outbreak has reaffirmed to experts that there are far more cases on the ground than have been reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm99328mk000h3b5v5l89qsx4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Traveling in the southwest on Tuesday, Kennedy touted the response to the outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm995186b001n3b5vxw9u9q51@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our strategy has been very successful. … The growth rate has diminished substantially,” he said. “And so what we’re doing right here in the United States is a model for the rest of the world.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm99328mk000j3b5vj97rjdpq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But experts say it’s not so simple.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm99328mk000l3b5vz3x4ok67@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I don’t think that RFK Jr. has the information to be able to say that. I don’t think any of us have full situational awareness of what’s going on with this outbreak. … We think cases are undercounted,” Adalja said. “You can’t say something is flattening if you don’t actually know the denominator of cases or [have] an understanding you’re getting [the] full capture of the cases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm993mkww00063b6ov8tqdvm1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The outbreak will continue until the virus infects all susceptible people in the area, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm993d8ae00023b6ohifcpo39@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “All of these cases could be avoided if everyone who had the ability to be vaccinated did so,” said Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician at PM Pediatric Care in Annapolis, Maryland. “Our overall vaccination rates are declining, which is an anti-science trend, so I’m not sure the United States is a model at all in this regard.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm99328mk000m3b5vpuzdbtav@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC updated its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/stay-alert-for-measles-cases.html" target="_blank"&gt;measles guidance&lt;/a&gt; for health care providers across the country Tuesday, urging them to stay alert for possible cases. The agency noted that 12% of reported cases this year had been hospitalized and that the “measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination is the best way to protect against measles and its complications.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

This led to the widespread abandonment of children, who ended up in orphanages in appalling conditions where they received no care, attention or love. Though tragic, this infamous “natural experiment” has allowed us to learn a great deal about the effects of early-life trauma on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31907309/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; into these children found that many of them had smaller brain volumes, which partially explained their poor cognitive performance. This atrophy was more severe in children who had spent longer in institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood is the most sensitive period for &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-theres-no-such-thing-as-normal-in-child-development-244681"&gt;neurodevelopment&lt;/a&gt;, but sadly, it can be disrupted in many ways, from abuse or neglect to exposure to war and violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A question of stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the neurobiological effects of childhood adversity can help us understand and treat its long-term psychological effects. Evidence suggests that these particularly affect the main &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-we-discovered-the-link-between-childhood-trauma-a-faulty-stress-response-and-suicide-risk-in-later-life-88838"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; regulation system, known as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary%E2%80%93adrenal_axis"&gt;hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis&lt;/a&gt;. The activity of this system can be measured through hormones such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt;, collectively known as glucocorticoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In normal amounts, cortisol helps to mobilise the body to deal with threats or challenges. However, excessive amounts can be harmful – children exposed to war have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30149270/"&gt;elevated levels&lt;/a&gt; of both cortisol and &lt;a href="https://www.immunology.org/public-information/bitesized-immunology/receptors-molecules/immunoglobulin-iga"&gt;immunoglobulin-A&lt;/a&gt; in their saliva, which also indicates &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/im-feeling-run-down-why-am-i-more-likely-to-get-sick-and-how-can-i-boost-my-immune-system-237456"&gt;high immune system activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Changes in the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The imprints of adversity in the brain can also be more localised. One of the areas most sensitive to the effects of stress is the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-happens-in-the-hippocampus-32589"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;, a crucial structure in the formation of memories and spatial orientation, among other functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sensitivity is due to its high concentration of glucocorticoid receptors, the “stress hormones” which are present in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30149270/"&gt;high levels&lt;/a&gt; in families exposed to war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38878049/"&gt;largest and most recent study&lt;/a&gt; on the subject reported a 17% reduction in hippocampus size among children exposed to three or more traumatic events compared to those who had suffered none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The two types of trauma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that adversity varies not just in severity, but also in its type. Abuse or mistreatment leads to trauma by commission, while neglect or deprivation leads to trauma by omission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32455344/"&gt;2019 systematic research review&lt;/a&gt; found that adversity created by commission – such as physical or sexual abuse or exposure to gender-based violence – affects &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_system"&gt;limbic&lt;/a&gt; and paralimbic structures, including the &lt;a href="https://www.elsevier.es/es-revista-neurologia-argentina-301-articulo-el-volumen-amigdala-como-predictor-S1853002815000488"&gt;amygdala&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insular_cortex"&gt;insular cortex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These areas are part of the brain’s “&lt;a href="https://neuropsychologylearning.com/portfolio-item/alteracion-de-la-red-de-saliencia-en-el-trastorno-por-estres-postraumatico-una-revision-sistematica/"&gt;alert system&lt;/a&gt;”, and abuse causes them to be constantly overactive. This, in turn, causes extreme reactions to harmless stimuli, as seen in &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd"&gt;post-traumatic stress disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, neglect tends to affect the prefrontal areas of the brain, which are responsible for more complex processes such as planning and reasoning. The latter was clearly observed in the aforementioned &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31907309/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of state-fostered children in Romania, where an absence of care resulted in brain atrophy and cognitive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different types of adversity can also affect development in opposite ways: a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6326868/"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt; found that neglect slows maturation, while maltreatment accelerates it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Childhood adversity’s genetic footprint&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking findings of this century is that cicrumstances and environment can change genetic mechanisms. This happens through a process called &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/europe/topics/epigenetics-250"&gt;epigenetics&lt;/a&gt;, whereby certain genes are expressed to a greater or lesser extent depending on a person’s surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abused children, for instance, have been found to show &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5087600/"&gt;opposite to expected&lt;/a&gt; gene expression (high expression of genes that normally have low activity, and vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood maltreatment also causes “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6326868/"&gt;genetic ageing&lt;/a&gt;”: a pattern of genetic expression that is more advanced than usual for a person’s age. This ageing is also associated with greater risk of depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another surprising finding is that some epigenetic changes can occur during embryonic development. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5792223/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on the tragic &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/science/dutch-famine-genes.html"&gt;Dutch famine of 1944&lt;/a&gt; found that people whose mothers had experienced starvation during early pregnancy showed alterations in the expression of genes related to metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This explains, in part, their elevated body mass indexes and blood triglycerides compared to siblings who had been luckier and not suffered from starvation while in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The neurobiology of resilience&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important not to be defeatist: the brain is highly malleable, and many individuals can overcome early adversity. In psychology, this process is called &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-resilience-a-psychologist-explains-the-main-ingredients-that-help-people-manage-stress-218323"&gt;resilience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one of the cohorts of adopted Romanian children, IQ deficits were observed to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22840547/"&gt;decrease&lt;/a&gt; over the years following foster care until they approached normative levels. In addition, those who were in these institutions for less than six months had, from the outset, normative values for all the variables studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research into resilience is only just starting to reveal the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38483288/"&gt;neurobiological&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39369098/"&gt;psychosocial&lt;/a&gt; factors that mitigate the impact of severe and chronic stress. In some people, this can even enable what is known as &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220311-the-complicated-truth-of-post-traumatic-growth"&gt;post-traumatic growth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/247775/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/247775/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Sitting on the floor during leisure activities exposes the body to different movement patterns and positions.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Hanging from a bar for three minutes daily can improve posture, reduce pain, and enhance breathing and durability.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Walking 8,000 steps daily loads bones and tissues while helping the body clear waste through the lymphatic system.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Balanced nutrition with adequate protein and fruits and vegetables supports healthy movement and tissue repair.&lt;/li&gt;

            When people are young, if they are fortunate enough to enjoy good health, they get to move their bodies &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/19/health/play-fun-adult-mental-health-wellness/index.html"&gt;with carefree abandon&lt;/a&gt; — running, jumping, bending, dancing, twisting — in pursuit of whatever activity they are engaged in.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikou000h3b6mifbe8ho3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But if they are lucky enough to get older, life intervenes: Free time becomes more limited, and interests, responsibilities, habits and behavior all change. Many people abandon the playground and learn to sit — in a classroom, at the office, in front of the TV, in a car.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikou000i3b6malexy83j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then at some point, many notice they have grown stiffer, and maybe it hurts to do this movement or that one, or they can no longer move in all the ways they want to. And people often attribute the aches and pains to simply getting older — but is the change inevitable?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikou000j3b6m57r6xm3j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The one thing that doesn’t have to change over the whole lifespan is your range of motion,” Dr. Kelly Starrett, a physical therapist and former professional athlete, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikou000k3b6mo136z9mt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Quantifying mobility has been, excuse the pun, a moving target. “Every physician on the planet, every physical therapist, every chiropractic physician, all agree about what the body should be able to do. We’ve said, here’s what blood pressure is, and everyone knows that. Here’s what (body) temperature is, and everyone knows that. We started to become very sophisticated about understanding some aspects of our physiology, but not range of motion,” Starrett said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikou000l3b6m0v432mg6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What ended up happening is we created this definition of (mobility): Do you have access to your native range of motion? Can you control it? And, when we improve those things, did what matters to you improve?” he asked.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov000m3b6mu3n2ln8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Starrett’s most recent book, coauthored with his wife, Juliet Starrett, is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Built-Move-Essential-Habits-Freely/dp/0593534808" target="_blank"&gt;“Built To Move: The 10 Essential Habits To Help You Move Freely and Live Fully.”&lt;/a&gt; It addresses mobility: measuring it (with 10 tests) and, equally important, regaining it in small increments that don’t take up all your time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov000n3b6mpbum652f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “How do we simplify the process so it doesn’t feel so overwhelming?” he asked. “I’m not giving a busy working mother another listicle.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov000o3b6muepvn2y3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            Why should you care about range of motion and mobility when the couch is so comfy and many of your needs and wants are only a mouse click away? Because mobility is associated with longevity, Starrett said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov000r3b6md75ibcxu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He noted that falling is a big predictor of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/falls/data-research/facts-stats/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;injury and decline&lt;/a&gt; in people age 65 and older.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov000s3b6mu92fra4y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If I don’t have access to balance or range of motion, I can’t solve as many movement problems. And losing your balance is a movement problem,” he said. “Getting up and down and being independent is a movement problem. Being able to rise from a chair while you’re holding your baby or your cat, or holding a cup of coffee and a book is just a movement problem.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov000t3b6m0gb0jfbi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As you get older, your body is more likely to “throw an error,” Starrett said. It’s a matter of use it or lose it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov000u3b6ml7k2qfgg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If I want to have a joint and tendons that act like joints and tendons my whole life, I better use that joint and I better load those tendons,” he said. “Otherwise, they’re not going to be available to me as readily.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov000v3b6mdeu8h62d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Muscles and tissues are like obedient dogs, he said. “They always adapt. At no age do you stop healing. At no age do you lose the ability to reclaim range of motion. It’s going to be a little slower than when you were 15 — that’s true. But the bottom line is your body is always going to adapt.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            What can you do to easily retain or regain some of your mobility? Starrett has five tips.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm991ilb2001t3b6mgbwyp5e6@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="get-your-body-into-different-shapes" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Get your body into different shapes
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov000x3b6mvwt3k3lq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People mostly move from lying down to sitting in a chair to walking around a bit, Starrett noted. “Modern environments don’t really ask much of the movement language of our bodies. Most people are only using a few words that their bodies could write,” he said.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov000y3b6mnlianf14@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The first thing we should be thinking about is, ‘Well, how do I increase my exposure to more movement language?’” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov000z3b6m8t2g6u3q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One of the easiest ways, for example, that we think would foundationally change society is if people sat on the ground in the evening, for 20 or 30 minutes while they were watching TV, while they’re reading a book,” he said. “And that could be leaning up against the couch; it doesn’t have to be in a strict lotus.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov00103b6mlcqrn65z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Getting into and out of that cross-legged position will also expose you to different movements, especially in the hips and knees. The practice can also tell you a bit about your ability to move freely and effortlessly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov00113b6m58bnzt23@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Being able to get up and down from a cross-legged position is an excellent predictor of all-cause morbidity and all-cause mortality because … it says a lot about how you are interacting and adapting to your environment,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov00123b6m35u3rjqw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And if you need to fidget, fidget — because that will also get your body into additional interesting positions, he said, such as kneeling or squatting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            If you’re experiencing aches and pains in your shoulders, neck or back, Starrett has a fix. “I want you to hang for three minutes a day,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov00153b6m87owliuz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You can hang in many different ways, he said — by grabbing the edge of a sink or a doorframe or, better yet, a pull-up bar — just get your arms above your head and stretch a bit. Even the yoga pose “downward-facing dog” counts as hang time, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov00173b6mmk34o9oz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That would fundamentally change your posture, change your neck pain, change your breath, change your shoulders, make it so you’re more durable. I mean, that is a foundational posture,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov00183b6mhi6tgsgh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Go to the airport and watch people in the (body) scanner,” he said. “You’ll see why we have that as a test (in the book), because people literally … cannot put their arms over their head anymore.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov001a3b6mqoys2kqc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To keep stiffness at bay and maintain your mobility, Starrett advises everyone to do plenty of walking every day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9944jab000a3b6o2kwp5cu2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If I could give everyone in my family a pill that reduced all-cause mortality and morbidity by 51% — that’s walking 8,000 steps a day,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov001b3b6mawxxf4zy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you want your bones and tendons and ligaments and perceptive systems to work, you have to physically load them,” he said. “Right now, we’re seeing an epidemic of osteoporosis, osteopenia, sarcopenia — people are losing muscle, losing bone. That’s because this body is an adaptation machine, and if you stress it, it adapts, and if you&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;don’t stress it, it adapts (in an undesirable way).” Walking loads our bones, our connective tissue, our tendons and our musculature.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov001c3b6mfofugpjp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, walking helps the body decongest and clear waste, Starrett said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov001d3b6mob5y9u5i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Your body makes about 3 to 4 liters of lymphatic fluid every day,” he explained. “And the lymph system is the sewage system of the body: all of the broken-down cellular material, all of the waste, all the proteins that are too big to come in through your capillaries, all go out through your lymphatic system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov001e3b6m8qqoduqg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What we need to do is appreciate that that sewage system of the body has been bootstrapped through our muscle system,” he said. “And so, if we want to decongest, move the waste along, then we have to keep moving.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov001f3b6m2vpgqoqu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It also happens that as congested tissues get stiff, they don’t heal as well, he said. By decongesting our tissues, we get improved blood flow, which is also good for the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov001g3b6msyv5rhoa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Exercise doesn’t need to be all work.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov001h3b6m93322bb6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We started to treat the health of the body as like some onerous task,” said Starrett, noting that play has been lost in our modern lives. “When’s the last time you did a sport or jumped into a dance class?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov001i3b6m7n84azsd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One of my favorite tools that I use even for my elite athletes (are videos by) Caleb Marshall, who is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheFitnessMarshall" target="_blank"&gt;The Fitness Marshall&lt;/a&gt;,” he said. “We use (his free three-minute dance routines) to warm up, to have fun, to laugh. And what it does is it gets me moving in a novel way. It gets me interacting with my friends. It’s super fun.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov001j3b6mcgf8bopp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Starrett also carries around a flying disc in his backpack so wherever he and his wife go, they can have spontaneous play during a moment of free time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov001k3b6mpjc4fs4h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Play could be a continuum,” he said. “Going for a walk with your friends in the evening — I’m going to call it play. Exploring your neighborhood on a hike could be play. Humans are best when we’re playing. And that will solve a lot of movement problems.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov001l3b6myt6v5isn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For robust physical movement, Starrett advised a balanced diet with enough protein and fruits and vegetables.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov001m3b6mc1ho86j6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Starrett recommended aiming for &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/search/keyword/?q=%23800gchallenge" target="_blank"&gt;800 grams of fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; a day. “That could be frozen, that could be fresh, that could be beans, that could be potatoes, that could be fruits and vegetables — not just kale,” he said. “It’s about fiber and micronutrients. I need you to have all the vitamins and minerals on board so that you can have healthy tissues.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov001n3b6m7j9d2gtm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And he recommends at minimum getting 0.7 to 0.8 grams of protein per pound of body weight. “It’s about, ‘Hey, I want to have enough protein on board to be able to build muscle and build bone.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov001o3b6mq7rf7vjt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/14/health/sleep-circadian-rhythm-body-clock-wellness/index.html"&gt;And don’t forget sleep.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov001p3b6mouo8zp2k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You’ve got to sleep,” Starrett said. “There’s not a single study in the world that says you can get by&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;with less than seven hours of sleep. So, we look at seven as our sort of minimum threshold.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm991ikov001q3b6me6qvn5o5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When I work with people who are in chronic pain, who want to change their body composition, learn a skill, heal an injury, we start with their sleep,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="t-copy has-xxl-vert-marg"&gt;
    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As measles tears through West Texas — infecting hundreds, hospitalizing dozens and claiming the lives of two children — some lawmakers in Austin are pushing bills to roll back vaccine requirements and expand access to exemptions under the banner of “choice.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Measles, a highly contagious disease that was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, has swept through West Texas communities with lower-than-average vaccination rates, turning Texas into the &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/21/texas-measles-vaccine-new-mexico-oklahoma-us/"&gt;epicenter of a possible national epidemic&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/02/18/texas-measles-outbreak-climbs/"&gt;505 cases&lt;/a&gt; identified since late January, including 57 hospitalizations and &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/06/measles-texas-outbreak-death-unvaccinated/"&gt;two deaths&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Two shots of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which has been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;administered for decades&lt;/a&gt;, is the safest and most effective way to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html"&gt;build immunity&lt;/a&gt; to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Still, Texas lawmakers have &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/01/27/texas-legislature-vaccine-mandate-bills/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20those%20who%20want%20to,must%20get%20the%20affidavit%20notarized."&gt;introduced bills&lt;/a&gt; to weaken vaccine mandates and make it easier for parents to obtain exemptions for their children — and there’s little indication that the state’s worst outbreak in three decades has changed their thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Cases are concentrated in the districts of Texas House Republican leaders, including the speaker, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/dustin-burrows/"&gt;Dustin Burrows&lt;/a&gt;, and state Rep. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/ken-king/"&gt;Ken King&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the State Affairs committee. Four of the ten counties in Texas’ designated outbreak area are in Burrows’ district. King’s district includes Gaines County, which has the highest concentration of cases.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Neither responded to a request for comment on whether they support proposals to pull back on vaccine requirements in light of the outbreaks in their districts.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In late February, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/02/28/texas-measles-abbott-lawmakers-response/"&gt;Burrows said&lt;/a&gt; that he was closely monitoring the situation. He &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/texas-house-speaker-dustin-burrows-praises-the-states-response-to-measles-outbreak/"&gt;praised the state’s response&lt;/a&gt; in early March and said that the state was “bringing the vaccines over to the county … and making sure people have the resources and the tools they need to get the vaccinations.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The districts of Republican state Sens. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/kevin-sparks/"&gt;Kevin Sparks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/charles-perry/"&gt;Charles Perry&lt;/a&gt; largely encompass the outbreak area. Neither responded to a request for comment. Sparks has &lt;a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;amp;Bill=SB2119"&gt;sponsored bills&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;amp;Bill=SB407"&gt;expand vaccine exemptions&lt;/a&gt; for health care workers and Perry has &lt;a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/89R/billtext/pdf/SB00269I.pdf#navpanes=0"&gt;introduced legislation&lt;/a&gt; to require health care providers to report “adverse events” related to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Generally, I don't support forced vaccines,” said state Rep. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/david-spiller/"&gt;David Spiller&lt;/a&gt;, R-Jacksboro, whose district has seen one confirmed case of measles so far. “I support parents making the choice for their children, and those that want to can. Obviously there are consequences if there’s a problem, but I do support vaccine choice.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;State Rep. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/pat-curry/"&gt;Pat Curry&lt;/a&gt;, R-Waco, who introduced a bill to make vaccine exemption forms available to parents online, said he is not a vaccine expert but believed that “each parent should have a choice as to what they want to do.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Most vaccine-related bills have not yet been heard in committee in the House, while the Senate has advanced a number of bills that would &lt;a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/89R/billtext/pdf/SB00095I.pdf#navpanes=0"&gt;require health care providers&lt;/a&gt; to obtain “full informed consent” before administering a vaccine to a child and a parental “bill of rights” that includes the right to opt their child out of immunization.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;State Rep. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/gary-vandeaver/"&gt;Gary VanDeaver&lt;/a&gt;, R-New Boston and chair of the Public Health Committee, said his panel was still considering which bills to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We’re not interested in any kind of rollback of the measles vaccine,” he said Tuesday. “The MMR is a safe vaccine and something that needs to continue to be encouraged for children — at the same time, recognizing that parents have the right to opt out.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;VanDeaver recognized the “possibility” that increased exemptions could make outbreaks more likely and painful, but he said that &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/20/texas-measles-family-gaines-county-death/"&gt;properly educating&lt;/a&gt; Texans on the importance of getting the measles vaccine would help.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“If we do a better job educating people, I think we’ll be OK,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Democrats and vaccine supporters blasted what they called a lack of guidance from top lawmakers that was contributing to a worsening crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Something that shouldn’t be a problem is a problem because our leadership will not step up and say what needs to be said,” state Rep. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/john-bucy/"&gt;John Bucy&lt;/a&gt;, D-Austin and a member of the Public Health Committee, said. “They’re so scared of primaries and following the uneducated grassroots on this that they won’t lead.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We’d have two more kids alive right now and a lot less kids sick if we just followed the basic science,” he added. “Any legislation to go the other way is going to lead to more kids dying in Texas.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;State Rep. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/ann-johnson/"&gt;Ann Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, D-Houston and a Public Health committee member, said that legislation and rhetoric purporting to expand “choice” was helping “fuel misinformation around a public health crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“MMR is a good, solid vaccine. This is the consequence of demonizing science,” she said. Parents “want to do right by their kids, and they are being led down this path to actually hurt their children.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Johnson added: “We’re not talking about adult freedom. We’re talking about adult manipulation for politics that’s killing kids.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Advocates on both sides of the debate said they had not noticed any shifts in lawmaker attitudes toward these bills since the crisis deepened.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I cannot tell you how disappointing it is,” said Terri Burke, executive director of The Immunization Partnership. “There’s not been any full throated attempt by the leadership in this state to say, ‘Get your kiddos vaccinated, save their lives.’ I mean that from the governor on down.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/02/28/texas-measles-abbott-lawmakers-response/"&gt;The Texas Tribune reported&lt;/a&gt; that state leaders had not addressed the outbreak publicly even after a child died, Gov. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/greg-abbott/"&gt;Greg Abbott&lt;/a&gt; posted on social media that he had directed the state to deploy “all necessary resources to ensure the safety and health needs of Texans.” He did not mention the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Michelle Evans, political director of Texans for Vaccine Choice, said that the outbreak had not come up in conversations with lawmakers and did not seem to be “impacting our progress or anybody’s willingness to stand with us.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Evans said that even as the Senate was moving faster to approve measures loosening vaccine requirements, committee membership in the House “leans our way much more strongly” than it did in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;She argued that despite the outbreak, “vaccine choice is the right policy. It’s a civil liberties issue, regardless of whether it’s the COVID pandemic, whether there’s a measles outbreak.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Evans added that bills her group supports are not trying to increase the number of vaccine exemptions, but to make it easier to access those exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We are just trying to make it so that parents who do want to exercise this right have the ability to do so in the most expeditious and respectful manner possible,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Parents who want to send their child to school unvaccinated for philosophical, religious or conscientious reasons can do so by requesting a form from the state health department that is then mailed to them. They then fill it out, notarize it and submit to their school and after school programs.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Gaines County, the center of the crisis, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/07/nx-s1-5312107/how-a-measles-outbreak-overwhelmed-a-small-west-texas-town#:~:text=The%20kindergarten%20vaccination%20rate%20for,rates%20could%20be%20even%20lower."&gt;82% of kindergarteners are vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; against measles, mumps and rubella. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that outbreaks are more likely when the vaccination rate in a community falls below 95%.)&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“If you need further proof that there’s a problem with relaxing this process, you’ve got it in Gaines County,” Burke said. “There’s a through line from this measles outbreak to these nonmedical exemptions.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Since late January and as of Tuesday, Texas has seen 505 measles cases, including 57 hospitalizations. Two school-aged children — neither of whom was vaccinated, nor had any underlying conditions — have died after contracting measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The largest demographic of people getting infected with measles is children under the age of 18, who made up 351 of the 505 cases.&lt;/p&gt;

Can a short-lived health kick change the way you eat in the long term and help you build sustainable habits? Or can jumping on the bandwagon — and potentially not seeing the same results others tout — backfire? Here’s what experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="why-nutrition-challenges-can-be-beneficial"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why nutrition challenges can be beneficial…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Want to eat better but need some extra motivation? Dietitian Julia Long tells Yahoo Life that nutrition challenges can be “a great way to encourage people to focus on healthy habits in a structured and engaging way.” Since there are rules for what you should or shouldn’t eat, you have clear guidance that can take the guesswork out of eating healthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of the perks of a nutrition challenge, dietitian &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.arnutrition.net/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Adam Ross;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Adam Ross&lt;/a&gt; tells Yahoo Life, is that it can provide “education” about what you’re eating. Depending on what challenge you're trying, you can learn more about what foods are part of a healthy diet and how your body responds to them. Maybe you discover that &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/whats-the-best-snack-18-dietitian-approved-ideas-to-help-you-decide-what-to-eat-103039246.html" data-ylk="slk:eating a protein-packed snack;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;eating a protein-packed snack&lt;/a&gt; — instead of hitting up the office vending machine for potato chips — helps you avoid the afternoon slump, or that &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/blueberries-often-called-superfood-heres-100049280.html" data-ylk="slk:a bowl of blueberries;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;a bowl of blueberries&lt;/a&gt; is more satisfying than a candy bar when you need a sweet treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ross also notes that the community aspect of some challenges can help you stay accountable and motivated. Whole30, for example, has support groups for those who want to share recipes, get advice or see how others are handling their nutritional overhauls. Those community members can also help rally you to stick to your nutritional plan when you’re craving french fries or need a little extra encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And if you see your challenge through, Long says you can expect to have “a sense of accomplishment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="but-you-should-also-proceed-with-caution"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But you should also proceed with caution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Not all nutrition challenges are created equal. Long says that some can be harmful “if they promote rigid thinking, unnecessary food restrictions or stress around eating.” Whether it’s a good idea to jump into a challenge in the first place depends on a person’s mindset and their relationship with food; someone who has &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/young-people-struggling-eating-disorders-support-tiktok-214804408.html" data-ylk="slk:struggled with an eating disorder;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;struggled with an eating disorder&lt;/a&gt; in the past, for example, is not a good candidate for a plan that promotes restriction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Long adds that we also should consider “how sustainable” the challenge is for the long term. Ross agrees, noting that if the challenge is overly restrictive and focused “solely on removing [entire] food groups, consuming only shakes and bars provided by the company or following a very low-calorie diet, it should definitely raise some red flags.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That’s because a nutrition challenge should be a jumping-off point for eating better overall — not something you do before going back to eating a low-quality diet the rest of the year. It’s key for nutrition challenges to at least have elements that you can take with you for the rest of your life, Long explains, even if you don’t strictly follow them every single day. (For example, you might reintroduce certain foods after a challenge ends, but ideally, you will, for the most, part leave with a better understanding of how nutritious meals can benefit you and be inspired to keep that up.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Nutrition challenges such as eating a vegetable with every meal, drinking more water or eating more colorful foods can introduce someone to a nutrition habit,” Long says. She explains that people will often “notice improvements in how they feel and function” when they engage in these types of health-forward challenges and stick with those learnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The key is to ensure that the challenge is flexible, realistic and focused on overall well-being rather than strict rules,” Long says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-are-some-sustainable-challenges-you-can-do"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some sustainable challenges you can do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you’re eager to try a challenge, consider something that you’ll be able to continue after the window on the challenge closes. For a month, try:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making time for mindful eating: &lt;/strong&gt;Do you often eat in front of the TV or have lunch while writing emails at your desk? For a month, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/distracted-eating-us-gain-weight-150323069.html" data-ylk="slk:focus on mindful eating;cpos:17;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;focus on mindful eating&lt;/a&gt; with no distractions. You’ll eat slower, which improves digestion, and may even eat less because you’re able to properly assess your hunger cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balancing your plate: &lt;/strong&gt;Long’s preferred nutrition challenge? Keeping things balanced: Build at least one meal a day with “protein, fiber-rich carbs, vegetables and healthy fats,” she says. That could look like a piece of salmon served with quinoa, chopped zucchini and some olive-oil-based dressing. “This would help improve energy levels, digestion and overall nutrition without feeling restrictive,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooking at home: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-reasons-stop-dining-000029395.html" data-ylk="slk:Take-out and restaurant meals can be expensive;cpos:18;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Take-out and restaurant meals can be expensive&lt;/a&gt; — not to mention full of sodium and hidden calories.

In his best-selling book, “Outlive,” he says that the federal recommendations for protein are “a joke,” suggesting that most healthy and active people should consume nearly three times as much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://foodinsight.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-IFIC-Food-Health-Survey.pdf" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;In a 2024 survey&lt;/a&gt; of 3,000 U.S. adults, 71 percent said they were trying to consume more protein — up from 59 percent in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So, are the federal recommendations wrong?

The first human trial of a therapeutic based on an ‘epigenetic editor’ began earlier this year, with a string of others due to start in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade or so, tools like Crispr that allow precise targeting of specific sections of DNA have led to a plethora of &lt;a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/crispr-moves-into-the-clinic/4016694.article"&gt;medical treatments based on gene editing&lt;/a&gt;. These therapies generally cut DNA at specific points, allowing for faulty genes to be repaired or replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, several genomic medicine companies are developing treatments based on a similar, but subtly different, concept. In contrast to gene editing, epigenetic editing doesn’t change the DNA sequence. Instead, epigenetic editors add or remove chemical tags to genes that regulate how much those genes are expressed. The technique mimics the natural mechanisms that cells use to turn different genes on and off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The basics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epigenetic changes happen naturally throughout our lives and in response to environmental stimuli. There are several different ways in which they alter a gene’s activity. For example, adding methyl tags to a gene can make it less accessible to the ribosome – the cell’s machinery that reads DNA and enables the production of the protein that each gene codes for. As a result, a methylated gene will become less active, or even silenced altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acetyl tags can make it more likely that a gene is read by the ribosome, meaning that the protein that the gene codes for will be expressed in greater quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activation of some genes and not others explains how distinct cell types are produced, despite the DNA stored in each cell containing the same full set of genes. But while epigenetics is an essential part of biology, dysregulation of these mechanisms is linked to many diseases. The new epigenetic editors that are now entering human trials aim to tackle this in a targeted and site-specific way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any off-target effects that an epi-editor makes are very, very unlikely to have any significant impact on biology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek Jantz, chief scientific officer at Tune Therapeutics, explains that while the potential of epigenetic editing was recognised decades ago, recent technological advances have finally made it a realistic proposition. ‘We have Crispr–Cas that we can use to very easily reprogram these things to hit different locations. We have a much better understanding of non-coding regions of the genome and how they affect gene expression. We have delivery technologies that didn’t exist until recently,’ he says. ‘So everything, just in the last couple of years, has come to a head that now it is possible to do this, and we’re seeing a small number of programs moving into the clinic.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers investigating these potential treatments point to numerous advantages. For example, epigenetic editors simply alter the expression of existing genes, rather than cutting and introducing permanent changes to the DNA sequence. And because an epigenetic editor needs to add multiple tags to the DNA to significantly alter gene expression, the consequences of an off-target hit with an epigenetic editor are unlikely to be as drastic as with a gene editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘If you think about gene editing or base editing, you can imagine Crispr–Cas floating through a cell, it hits the genome in the wrong place, it cuts the DNA, it introduces a mutation into the DNA, and that mutation is there forever. It’s a binary effect – the gene is either edited or it’s not,’ says Jantz. ‘That’s not the case with epigenetic editing. The way epi-editing works is much more stochastic.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="picture"&gt;&lt;img alt="Methyltransferase complexed with DNA" src="https://d2cbg94ubxgsnp.cloudfront.net/Pictures/480xany/2/2/1/540221_f0069711methyltransferase_complexed_with_dna_50042.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 780px" srcset="https://d2cbg94ubxgsnp.cloudfront.net/Pictures/480xany/2/2/1/540221_f0069711methyltransferase_complexed_with_dna_50042.jpg 480w,https://d2cbg94ubxgsnp.cloudfront.net/Pictures/600xany/2/2/1/540221_f0069711methyltransferase_complexed_with_dna_50042.jpg 600w,https://d2cbg94ubxgsnp.cloudfront.net/Pictures/780xany/2/2/1/540221_f0069711methyltransferase_complexed_with_dna_50042.jpg 780w" loading="lazy" class="lazyloaded"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Using methylation, for example, if we target a DNA methyltransferase to a particular region in a gene, and it adds a single methyl group to a single base in the genome, that is very unlikely to have any effect whatsoever. And in fact, it’s probably going to get lost as soon as that cell divides, as soon as the DNA is replicated,’ he adds. ‘So what has to happen is that methyltransferase has to hit that site over and over and over again, and it gradually builds up methylation … and only with repeated hits from the methyltransferase do we build up enough methylation that the gene actually gets silenced.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern genome-wide RNA-sequencing assays enable companies like Tune to quantify whether an epigenetic editor has made any unwanted changes to gene expression. ‘If they are there, we can find them,’ says Jantz, but generally there are few, if any, he adds. ‘So it is a much, much easier argument to make to regulators, investigators and patients, that the off-target effects that an epi-editor makes are very, very unlikely to have any significant impact on biology.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In the clinic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tune, which has US sites in Durham and Seattle, was launched in 2021 to build on the research of Duke University’s Charles Gersbach. The company just raised &lt;a href="https://tunetx.com/tune-therapeutics-completes-over-175m-in-series-b-financing-to-advance-field-leading-epigenome-editing-programs/"&gt;$175 million&lt;/a&gt; (£140 million) of investment, which it says will enable it to develop its technology platform and expand its pipeline. Importantly, the money will also support its clinical program: in November 2024, Tune &lt;a href="https://tunetx.com/tune-therapeutics-moves-into-clinical-spotlight-with-tune-401-a-first-in-class-epigenetic-silencer-for-hepatitis-b/"&gt;received approval to start a clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; of its hepatitis B (HBV) treatment in New Zealand. &lt;a href="https://tunetx.com/tune-therapeutics-receives-approval-to-initiate-clinical-trial-in-hong-kong-for-hepb-epigenetic-silencer/"&gt;A similar trial in Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt; was approved in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘We picked those two sites in part because they have a very high prevalence of chronic hepatitis B, but also because the two most prominent HBV clinical investigators are in New Zealand and Hong Kong. We were very fortunate that these two individuals, M F Yuen and Ed Gane, saw the potential for our approach and wanted to be the investigators on the study,’ explains Jantz. ‘So that is underway now, and we are getting patient data in and looking to see what it does.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tune’s treatment is delivered by a lipid nanoparticle to hepatocytes in the liver, where the hepatitis B virus replicates. Within the nanoparticle is mRNA that codes for a protein that induces epigenetic changes to the viral genome. ‘We silence the virus, both through methylation and through changes in chromatin structure, and that then turns the virus off,’ explains Jantz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One benefit of the approach is that the effects on the virus persist after the therapy has been cleared from the body. ‘It’s a completely different way of thinking about HBV treatment, in that you don’t have to constantly redose to keep the virus suppressed,’ says Jantz. ‘We should be able to do it with a single shot, or a limited number of shots. You can imagine coming in, treating a patient once, suppressing the virus to 90–99%, coming in again maybe two or three times, and getting it all the way off.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Delivering the goods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another company looking to initiate clinical trials with an epigenetic-editor-based treatment for hepatitis is nChroma Bio. The company, based in Boston, US, is currently carrying out preclinical studies on its lead candidate, and &lt;a href="https://www.contagionlive.com/view/nchroma-bio-raises-75m-to-advance-epigenetic-editing-for-hepatitis-b-and-d-cure"&gt;recently secured $75 million&lt;/a&gt; to move the programme forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘We’re going to be filing a [clinical trial application] for this year, which is in hepatitis B and D.’ says nChroma Bio’s chief scientific officer, Melissa Bonner. She highlights the huge opportunity of a successful therapy, given a general lack of treatments for both hepatitis B and D, and the fact that hepatitis D increases the risk of developing liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘It also represents an interesting target, because it doesn’t actually exist in the human genome, so the specificity for the hepatitis genome of the epigenetic editors is pretty exquisite,’ she adds. ‘So we’re seeing very specific targeting to the hepatitis genome in our preclinical models. We’re seeing robust silencing of the hepatitis genome, and we’re seeing [almost 99.99%] reduction of hepatitis B surface antigen.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemistry coming out from our genes is written in epigenetics – it’s really the regulatory layer of the DNA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nChroma Bio was formed in late 2024 by a merger of Chroma Medicine, which specialised in epigenetic medicines, and NVelop, which developed new drug delivery technologies. Like Tune, nChroma’s hepatitis treatment is currently delivered inside lipid nanoparticles. However, by combining the two companies’ expertise, nChroma believes it will be able to develop medicines that use more complex delivery systems, to access harder-to-reach tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonner says the company plans to exploit virus-like particles to target tissues beyond the liver, unlocking cell and tissue types that are currently really challenging to access. ‘That way we can actually get these amazing cargoes … to places, so that they can have therapeutic benefit – I think that there are definitely use cases where epigenetic silencing in combination with targeted delivery in vivo is going to be something that we’re very interested in and actively developing.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Further indications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-based Epicrispr Biotechnologies (Epic Bio) is aiming to launch a trial of an epigenetic editor delivered in a viral vector this year. The company was founded in 2021 by Lei Stanley Qi, who eight years earlier &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867413002110"&gt;developed a way to silence genes&lt;/a&gt; using a ‘catalytically dead’ cas9 protein, while working in the lab of the Crispr pioneer Jennifer Doudna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epic Bio has &lt;a href="https://epicrispr.com/epicrispr-biotechnologies-secures-68-million-series-b-to-initiate-clinical-trial-for-first-in-class-disease-modifying-epigenetic-neuromuscular-therapy-for-fshd/"&gt;raised $68 million&lt;/a&gt; to begin a human trial this year of a treatment for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a heritable disease that severely weakens numerous muscle tissues. The disease is linked to expression of a gene called Dux4. Usually, this gene is only active in young embryos, before natural methylation turns it off. But in FSHD patients, the gene is undermethylated, leading to production of a protein that is toxic to muscle cells. Epic Bio’s approach is to use an epigenetic editor to add more methyl groups and silence the gene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘It’s becoming clear that this particular gene in the muscular cells – human myocytes – is expressed in abnormally high levels in patients … leading to high toxicity. And this gene has multiple copies, so [gene] editing is not a solution,’ says Qi. ‘The key is to moderate with epigenetics to restore it to the normal level.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the unique features of Epic’s platform is the CasMini system that was developed in Qi’s lab at Stanford University, US. CasMini is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276521006481"&gt;less than half the size of Cas9&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it easier to package into viral vectors that are, so far, the only clinically proven way to deliver therapies to harder-to-reach tissue types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘So if you want to get to the skeletal muscle as an example, the only way people have been able to deliver [drugs] right now is with [a viral] vector, ’ explains Epic Bio chief executive Amber Salzman. ‘When you use an [adeno-associated virus] to deliver to the muscle, that payload is actually pretty small – so cas9 won’t fit,’ she adds. ‘This is where – building on Stanley’s CasMini –we open up the door to diseases [in many other] tissue types.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, EpicBio received approval for a human trial of its FSHD therapy in New Zealand. Salzman explains that the company’s trial will initially involve three patients. ‘It’s more of your typical … gene therapy trial, which usually starts at the minimally efficacious dose,’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the drug is well tolerated, the trial will take on further small batches of patients, gradually increasing the dose. ‘We’ll be looking not just at safety, but a few things,’ adds Salzman. ‘One is we’ll be doing a muscle biopsy at baseline and month three – and at month three, we’ll be able to see: do we, in fact, methylate? Do we suppress the downstream of Dux4, as well as Dux4? So it’ll basically prove that we have target engagement. And then of course, we’ll also be monitoring functional measures like muscle strength and stride velocity.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Targeting the CNS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sangamo Therapeutics, headquartered in Richmond, US, is another company aiming to solve the challenge of delivering epigenetic editors to different tissue types. Rather than a Crispr–Cas based system, Sangamo’s platform is based on zinc-finger proteins that recognise and bind to DNA. The small size of the zinc fingers means that they are easier to fit into viral vectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The zinc finger platform that Sangamo uses is based off the human C2H2 zinc fingers, of which there are already 350 examples in the human body – so our bodies have already used this as an engineering platform to do gene regulation,’ explains Gregory Davis, Sangamo’s head of research and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘The thing we’ve been focusing on the most is our zinc finger repressors. They’re small proteins, they have the zinc finger portion, which is usually about six fingers long, and then we attach to it an epigenetic repression domain, typically it’s called a Krab domain,’ says Davis. ‘And the zinc finger will bind the control region of a gene, and this Krab protein will sit there along with the zinc finger at that site, and it will recruit a native complex within the cell that just exists in every human cell to come and methylate in that region and shut the gene down.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sangamo is specifically looking at neurological applications for its epigenetic editors. This summer, the company will launch a clinical trial of a treatment for idiopathic small fibre neuropathy (ISFN), a chronic pain syndrome. As the target cells are located in spinal nerves, the editor will be delivered in an adeno-associated virus called AAV9, which has a high affinity for the central nervous system, and will be administered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug will target the SCN9A gene, which codes for a particular sodium ion channel (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7) that is expressed in high levels in pain neurones. Mutations in Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 are linked to a range of pain disorders, including extreme pain disorders and also congenital insensitivity to pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re exquisitely specific because we target the DNA – we’re not a small molecule that targets the protein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major benefit of Sangamo’s approach is that it can target Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7, without impacting other related sodium ion channels. ‘We’re exquisitely specific because we target the DNA – we’re not a small molecule that targets the protein – and we have shown in our animal model and in vitro that we are very specific to Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 and do not touch the other ones, so that’s really exciting,’ notes Nathalie Dubois-Stringfellow, chief development officer at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is also targeting diseases of the brain, but delivering epigenetic editors to brain tissue is especially difficult. Dubois-Stringfellow explains that Sangamo committed significant effort to develop viral capsids that can be injected intravenously, cross the blood–brain barrier and reach a wide range of brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year ago, the company revealed preclinical data on an adeno-associated virus capsid variant named Stac-BBB. In non-human primates, the vector delivered cargo to brain tissue &lt;a href="https://www.sangamo.com/presentation/presentation-identification-and-characterization-of-stac-bbb-an-engineered-aav-capsid-that-exhibits-widespread-transduction-of-the-central-nervous-system-in-cynomolgus-macaques/"&gt;700-times more effectively than AAV9&lt;/a&gt;. Dubois-Stringfellow says that this ‘best-in-class’ blood–brain barrier penetrating vector opened the door to a lot of different diseases, and the company is now building a whole pipeline of treatments around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First on the list are inherited prion diseases, for which there are currently no treatments. These neurodegenerative illnesses are caused by a misfolding protein that is encoded by a gene called PRNP. So far, Sangamo has shown that it can supress PRNP in animal models, and is planning to apply to begin a human trial in the UK in early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘We know from the monkey study that [the drug] goes into the all the regions that are important to target for prion disease,’ says Dubois-Stringfellow. ‘And we also have extraordinary empirical data in a mouse model of prion disease, where we extend the life of mice to a normal life, when they should have died within three months.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sangamo’s technology has also been licensed by other biomedical companies. Genentech paid $50 million up front, with a potential $1.9 billion to follow in milestone payments, to license the Stac-BBB system and Sangamo’s zinc-finger repressors &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-024-02413-x"&gt;to target the tau protein&lt;/a&gt; that is linked to Alzheimer’s disease. Astellas and Eli Lilly have also signed similar deals, licensing rights to use Stac-BBB in neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A bright future&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The chemistry coming out from our genes is written in epigenetics – it’s really the regulatory layer of the DNA,’ says Epic Bio’s Qi. He notes that while companies are establishing the safety of epigenetic editors, they are predominantly focusing on diseases that are well understood. But he believes that in the future, treatments based on precision epigenetic editing could extend to a wide range of other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘In human genetics research, people have found clues or [specific gene] mutations causing about 30 to 40% of diseases,’ he says. ‘But other diseases related to aging, cancer, neurological conditions, Alzheimer’s, you name it – many of them cannot be linked to a clear mutation.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘It’s very clear, a lot of these diseases develop while people grow – while people adapt to environments after they are born – and are related to epigenetics. From the medicine side, these are super-high stakes, affecting a lot of people,’ he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘For now, we’re really focused on the diseases that we understand well, to develop the drugs and prove they are safe and bring them into the human body. But in the future, there are really bright possibilities for how they could be used.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Chemistry World</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2025 08:28:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQRmhvUFpoRnh2QjVpMTBpSGQzM3Z0eGFXRFB1aVlJbjJMZGRoMEJnUHdNZWhjanFtOTJQOHZ3aHlBSEtpLXJiZ3BPRGRoWmhzb3Z0SWc2eno2cURWRFFVR2xTOTZlazFfUW51VjE2V0FEVGxLVTVVSG5NQktpLXJTTWtwX19KSXlfel9OSnIzd3ZRdFBqc1Zz</guid></item><item><title>Coeur d'Alene man fights rare form of cancer - Coeur d'Alene Press</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxNTHlFZzdkUGpGV1c4amhCcGI0djEzZ2xLVkVVUkJDUS10NFQwSlhHdEhual9ncEpCS3dsSFFZaDNGYnNwZGV3RGVCNHBRaHFBSjZfbnl4b1JYVEN5OVF1cGtvWDNTb2hQNWh6ZS1kMUQ1RjJEcjhPaUFvenFNU0o2Nzl2dHJZcXZJQWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="text-body font-weight-normal fr-view" id="storycontent"&gt;
	
		
		

			
				
			

			
				
				
				
	                                &lt;p&gt;A Coeur d’Alene man is fighting a rare form of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;Nick Sawyers, 28, was diagnosed with a peripheral nerve sheath tumor, said his grandmother, Jan Sharon. It began with a pain in his right foreman in 2023, where a tumor was found by doctors and removed, but it grew back. More surgery required reconstruction of his arm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;The Post Falls High School graduate later had back pain and went to doctors, who found the cancer had metastasized and was growing near his spine. A few weeks ago, he was flown to Baltimore and underwent surgery at The Johns Hopkins Hospital to remove a large mass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;“Surgery was a success,” wrote his mom, Pam Sawyers-Brahler. “Doctors got the aggressive tumor out and fixed his back that the tumor broke and many other things! I am so grateful to God for guiding their hands and minds.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;Sharon said her grandson still faces a difficult road. He has lost a lot of weight and will undergo chemotherapy and radiation at Kootenai Health. He is expected to return home next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;“He goes in and out of hope,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;Sawyers, a mechanic, was healthy and positive before he was diagnosed with the aggressive form of cancer, Sharon said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;She said she has done her best to stay strong for him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;“I have faith,” Sharon said. “People are praying all over.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p lang="EN-US"&gt;A GoFundMe account for Sawyers has raised nearly $5,000 toward its goal of $20,000 to help with medical expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
