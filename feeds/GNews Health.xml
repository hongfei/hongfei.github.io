                &lt;p&gt;For about a year, Mariana wasn't sure what to make of her bloating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, she assumed it was just part of being a woman with a regular menstrual cycle. She also had some friends with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, thinking she had similar GI issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in April, she noticed &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rectal-bleeding-most-common-early-sign-of-colon-cancer-taboo-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;blood in her stool&lt;/a&gt; — one of the most common symptoms of colon cancer in young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That alarmed me a little bit," Tata, 26, told Business Insider. When it didn't go away for a month, she called her primary care physician, who believed the cause was hemorrhoids but sent Tata to get an abdominal scan just in case, as she was also diagnosed with anemia a few years before and suddenly had worsened symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scan revealed a 20-centimeter tumor on one of her ovaries. Tata was sent to Syracuse Hospital in New York, where more testing led to a stage 4 &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-so-many-young-people-getting-colon-cancer-answer-infancy-2025-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colon cancer diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;, with the cancer spreading to her abdominal wall. Shortly after, both of her ovaries and fallopian tubes would be removed, Tata losing her ability to have biological children.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Tata, still in treatment, remembers being shocked.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;"When you're young, you don't think that it's cancer," she said. "Colon cancer was not in my mind at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="22b62653-8245-42ce-b6df-6cae53718c63" data-toc-id="22b62653-8245-42ce-b6df-6cae53718c63"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer changed her life plans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                      Prior to her diagnosis, Tata planned to buy a house and have kids with her boyfriend.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prior to her diagnosis, Tata and her boyfriend discussed their future: Having kids and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/true-cost-young-colon-cancer-crisis-2025-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;buying a house together&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plans changed when she needed surgery to remove the large mass on her right ovary, which she soon learned damaged her left ovary as well. "There was no option to save any of my eggs," Tata said, meaning she would have to carry &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/young-cancer-fertility-preservation-egg-sperm-freezing-state-laws-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;donated eggs or embryos&lt;/a&gt; through IVF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Tata said, that means she's letting go of the idea of having children. Knowing she'd have to pay for cancer treatment also made her rethink other plans, like&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before she hit her deductible, she was "scraping together" as much as she could to pay for the ER visits, CT scan, abdominal scan, and blood work. While she said some friends helped put together a GoFundMe to help with costs, she's still paying off a hospital bill from the summer that cost nearly $1,000, and anticipates &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-true-hidden-cost-price-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;future treatment costs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is very rough, especially in your 20s and 30s when you plan on using your money for something else and then you get hit with cancer," she said. "You have to reevaluate what you're actually spending your money on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5e3e66b5-b44b-484e-a2fd-4c66024b3d6a" data-toc-id="5e3e66b5-b44b-484e-a2fd-4c66024b3d6a"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Splitting time between her boyfriend and parents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Tata splits her time between two homes, based on her &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/young-cervical-cancer-diagnosis-marriage-motherhood-finances-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;chemotherapy schedule&lt;/a&gt;. On the night before her next treatment, she leaves the apartment she shares with her boyfriend to go to her parents' house. Because her boyfriend works and her parents are retired, she can get more around-the-clock care there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My mom is the one who nurses me back to health, basically," Tata said, giving her anti-nausea medication around the clock. "My family has been absolutely amazing, and I think my being so strong comes from them because they carry me whenever I can't do it anymore."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tata, who had parts of her colon removed prior to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-cancer-innovations-asco-2025-exercise-as-drug-astra-zeneca-early-treatment-2025-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;starting chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt;, feels she bounces back better from treatments than &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-environmental-causes-microplastics-antibiotics-sleep-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;other cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; she's spoken to. On the alternating weeks that she doesn't have chemotherapy, she said she almost forgets she has cancer, focusing more on getting her strength back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the days when she gets disconnected from her chemo pump are brutal, usually lasting from Wednesday to Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It kind of punches you in the face and reminds you every two weeks that you have to go through this and you are sick," she said. "It's kind of just my new reality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="46baf615-d450-484f-afe1-b5148aa1e846" data-toc-id="46baf615-d450-484f-afe1-b5148aa1e846"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making sense of her diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;As of now, Tata is considered stable, with no progression of cancer as she continues chemotherapy treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My oncologist expects me to go back to work in February, which is very nice," she said. Tata, who is still employed as an enrollment operations assistant at her alma mater, Utica University, went on short-term and long-term disability during treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She's hoping her treatments become more scattered after chemotherapy, helping her to more closely return to the routine she had &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/identical-twins-young-colon-cancer-diagnosis-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;before her diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said connecting with other colon cancer patients through the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://colorectalcancer.org/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;Colorectal Cancer Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and a Facebook group helped her get more comfortable with sharing her experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the beginning of my diagnosis, I didn't know what to do with myself," she said. "I felt so alone, and I wasn't ready to talk to people." Connecting with others made it easier to deal with her ongoing treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="10fc57cb-2834-484d-85a9-0d9714976d2e" data-toc-id="10fc57cb-2834-484d-85a9-0d9714976d2e"&gt;Her advice: Get a second opinion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also made her more aware of the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/where-colon-cancer-on-the-rise-reasons-why-2024-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;rising rates of cancer&lt;/a&gt; among young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel like young people are the margin of the forgotten who do face this," she said. Given how subtle colon cancer symptoms can be, she hopes other young people take action if they sense a change in their body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Go to the doctor, no matter how big or small it is," she said. "Because what I thought was a small thing turned into a very big thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also emphasized advocating for yourself and even seeking out &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-colon-cancer-misdiagnosed-ibs-hemorrhoid-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;second opinions&lt;/a&gt;, because "not a lot of doctors jump when you notice bleeding in your stool." In her case, she's grateful that hers took immediate action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If my doctor didn't recommend a CT scan or abdominal scan, I don't know where I would be right now," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;If you feel a lift after exercise, you're in good company. Movement can boost mood, and according to the results of a new study, it can also help relieve symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As part of a &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/full" target="_blank"&gt;review of evidence &lt;/a&gt;by the Cochrane collaboration — an independent network of researchers — scientists evaluated 73 randomized controlled trials that included about 5,000 people with depression, many of whom also tried antidepressant medication.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"We found that exercise was as effective as pharmacological treatments or psychological therapies as well," says &lt;a href="https://arc-nwc.nihr.ac.uk/team/andrew-clegg/" target="_blank"&gt;Andrew Clegg&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of Lancashire in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The findings are not a surprise to psychiatrist &lt;a href="https://providers.inspirahealthnetwork.org/provider/stephen-mateka/1590056" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Stephen Mateka&lt;/a&gt;, medical director of psychiatry at Inspira Health. "This new Cochrane review reinforces the evidence that exercise is one of the most evidence-based tools for improving mood," says Mateka.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He explains how it mirrors some of the effects of medication. "Exercise can help improve neurotransmitter function, like serotonin as well as dopamine and endorphins. So there is certainly overlap between exercise and how antidepressants offer relief," Mateka says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In other words, exercise helps release chemicals in the body that are known to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/09/19/1200223456/depression-anxiety-prevention-mental-health-healthy-habits" target="_blank"&gt;boost mood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And there's another powerful effect too. Exercise can trigger the release of brain growth factors, explains &lt;a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-medicine/news-all/psychiatry-resident-dr-nicholas-fabiano-profiled-rising-star-new-neuroscience-journal" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Nicholas Fabiano&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Ottawa. He says depression can decrease neuroplasticity, making it harder for the brain to adapt and change.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The brain in depression is thought to be less plastic. So there's less what we call neurotrophic factors, or BDNF," Fabiano explains. He calls it the Miracle-Gro for the brain. "And we know that exercise can also boost it. So I think exercise is a fundamental pillar we really need to counsel patients on," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And while medications and therapy are important tools, Fabiano says exercise is recognized as a preferred &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10225323/#:~:text=The%20National%20Institute%20for%20Health,prevention%20and%20treatment%20of%20depression." target="_blank"&gt;treatment for depression&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Exercise has been adopted as a &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/59/20/1388.abstract" target="_blank"&gt;first-line treatment&lt;/a&gt; in guidelines for depression globally with good acceptability and safety," he writes. Yet he says it remains underappreciated and underutilized.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's much easier for a primary care physician to prescribe medication to a patient. You just write it on a pad," Fabiano says. It's harder to prescribe exercise, which takes time and effort and can be difficult to start for people who are depressed. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Fabiano says exercise can work best as part of a combination of treatments. "We can start someone on an antidepressant — maybe that improves their mood, and they're able to engage in therapy. And from there, maybe now they're more interested in starting some of these lifestyle habits like exercise," Fabiano says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;How much exercise is enough?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The evidence shows light to moderate exercise — where you get your heart rate up enough to feel slightly winded — can be as beneficial as vigorous or intense exercise, at least early on. And Fabiano says it's OK to start with a "low dose."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Ultimately you want to work your way up. But going from completely sedentary to even just going for a walk every day, that's where you start seeing those exponential gains," he says, stressing the importance of getting started with modest amounts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study found that a combination of aerobic exercise and resistance training appears to be more effective than aerobic alone. The meta-analysis found between 13 and 36 workouts led to improvements in depressive symptoms, though long-term follow-up was rare. Researchers say there's more to learn about how regular exercise may help stave off depression.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mateka says there are lots of options. "When it comes to exercise, it's about just finding the exercise that works for you, such as something like yoga or tai chi versus something like walking and jogging," he says. For some, group activity can add to the psychosocial benefits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, it's best to pick something you enjoy or go back to an activity or &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/14/nx-s1-5434386/social-prescription-arts-exercise-loneliness" target="_blank"&gt;sport you liked as a child&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Exercise is something that is extremely low cost. It's very accessible. It has very minimal side effects. And it has the opportunity to impact you positively, mentally, emotionally, socially and physically," Mateka says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NPR</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxPekM0YlR5b0ZTNGlqaUNZM2JlODdBNHNic0ZYbVc4cE1BbVpRUG1USkJiUmJnZ01sVVE3WHA5dnI1REMxMnRVdEdrd0JWc1hBeGdmYTltOTJhQU1WS3JnSUJDSFo2VTN2bTNCNUtOXzJOTVdSYjIyX2EtLWhrcFlsZEs0MGtwUGxTLTlzaUY2a01NNVA4SVFzV0poUnhES0ptbDVBSXh0MFExdkR2RzJYaFU3X1ZiZXE0Y3c</guid></item><item><title>一种鲜为人知的健康综合症可能会影响几乎所有人- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260112001001.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;A large majority of U.S. adults are unfamiliar with cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome, even though it affects nearly 90% of adults nationwide. CKM syndrome is a recently defined condition that brings together several major health problems, including heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes and obesity. According to a new survey from the American Heart Association, many people have not heard of CKM syndrome, yet most say they want to better understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 90% of U.S. adults have at least one risk factor linked to CKM syndrome.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; These risk factors include high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, high blood glucose (sugar), excess weight and reduced kidney function. When these issues occur together, they raise the risk of heart attack, stroke and heart failure far more than any single condition on its own. For many people, CKM syndrome can be reversed through changes in eating habits, physical activity and appropriate medical treatment.&lt;sup&gt;[2,3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We want people to know that it's really common to have heart, kidney and metabolic risk factors at the same time. It is reassuring that once the CKM connection was defined nearly three-quarters of those responding understood that it was important and wanted to learn more," said Eduardo Sanchez, M.D., FAHA, the American Heart Association's chief medical officer for prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Heart Kidneys and Metabolism Are Connected&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CKM health refers to the combined function of the heart, kidneys and metabolic system (responsible for creating, using and storing energy, which affects weight and blood glucose level). These systems rely on one another to work properly. If one begins to struggle, it can place added strain on the others. Over time, this interaction can create a harmful cycle that significantly increases the risk of developing CKM syndrome. The American Heart Association plans to release the first-ever clinical guidelines focused on CKM syndrome in early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the Survey Revealed About Public Awareness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new survey highlights major gaps in understanding about CKM health:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Only 12% of U.S. adults said they had heard of CKM health or CKM syndrome&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;79% agreed it is important to learn more about CKM health, and 72% said they want additional information&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Most respondents were interested in how CKM syndrome is treated (72%) and diagnosed (71%)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;68% incorrectly believed health conditions should be managed one at a time or were unsure of the best approach&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;42% thought a healthy heart would not likely be affected by other organ systems or were uncertain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The heart, kidney and metabolic systems are connected and, as such, should be treated in a coordinated way," Sanchez said. "These results reveal the need to emphasize those connections and help patients understand the importance of collaborative care."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helping People Take Action Earlier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through its CKM Health Initiative, the American Heart Association is offering educational tools and an online resource hub to explain how heart, kidney and metabolic health are linked. These resources aim to help people take early steps to lower their risk of heart attack, heart failure or stroke. The Association is also working with healthcare teams nationwide to strengthen collaboration among professionals caring for patients with multiple chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Simple Way to Understand CKM Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new educational video explains "2 truths" about heart health using clear visuals and plain language (watch the video here):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The heart pumps blood to the body&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The metabolic system turns glucose (sugar) from the blood into energy&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The process of metabolism dumps waste back into the blood&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The kidneys filter waste from the blood and balance fluids, which helps with blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Blood pressure affects how the heart pumps blood into the body&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CKM health is about your overall health," said Sanchez. "It's a full circle. You can take care of your overall health with regular checks of your blood pressure, cholesterol, weight, blood sugar and kidney function."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Survey Was Conducted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Harris Poll carried out the survey in August 2025 on behalf of the American Heart Association to measure public awareness of CKM syndrome and CKM health. Approximately 4,000 U.S. adults participated. Health care professionals can find additional resources on interdisciplinary care and learn how to join the CKM Health Initiative at &lt;a href="http://heart.org/CKMtools"&gt;heart.org/CKMtools&lt;/a&gt;. The American Heart Association's Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic Health Initiative is supported by Founding Sponsors Novo Nordisk® and Boehringer Ingelheim, Supporting Sponsors Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Bayer, and Champion Sponsor DaVita®.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Methodology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted online in the United States by The Harris Poll on behalf of the American Heart Association among 4,007 US adults aged 18+. The survey was conducted 8/6 -- 8/22/2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data were weighted by education, age by gender, race/ethnicity, region, household income, household size, marital status, employment and smoking status to reflect population proportions. Respondents were selected from individuals who agreed to participate in surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sampling precision for Harris online polls is measured using a Bayesian credible interval. For this study, results are accurate within ± 2.0 percentage points at a 95% confidence level. Precision varies across subgroups. As with all surveys, additional sources of error may exist, including nonresponse, question wording and post-survey adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
