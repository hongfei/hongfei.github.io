&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typhoid fever&lt;/strong&gt;, a disease once largely under control, is rapidly evolving into a dangerous global health threat. The bacterium responsible for this illness, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi&lt;/em&gt; (S Typhi)&lt;/strong&gt;, is becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. Although it is rare in developed countries, typhoid remains a persistent problem in developing regions, especially South Asia. According to a study published in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(22)00093-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet Microbe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this ancient pathogen is evolving resistance to antibiotics, making it harder to treat and posing a growing risk worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Rising Drug Resistance in South Asia&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the past three decades, the resistance of &lt;em&gt;S Typhi&lt;/em&gt; to antibiotics has been growing and spreading. The study, which sequenced the genomes of 3,489 &lt;em&gt;S Typhi&lt;/em&gt; strains collected between 2014 and 2019 in &lt;strong&gt;Nepal&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Pakistan&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;India&lt;/strong&gt;, found a concerning rise in &lt;strong&gt;extensively drug-resistant (XDR)&lt;/strong&gt; typhoid strains. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research indicates that &lt;em&gt;S Typhi&lt;/em&gt; is not only resistant to &lt;strong&gt;frontline antibiotics&lt;/strong&gt; such as &lt;strong&gt;ampicillin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;chloramphenicol&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole&lt;/strong&gt;, but also to &lt;strong&gt;fluoroquinolones&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;third-generation cephalosporins&lt;/strong&gt;. These new strains, which are now widespread in South Asia, are evolving faster than previously anticipated, replacing less resistant strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In their report, researchers emphasized the alarming speed at which these resistant strains have spread. “The speed at which highly-resistant strains of &lt;em&gt;S Typhi&lt;/em&gt; have emerged and spread in recent years is a real cause for concern,” said infectious disease specialist &lt;strong&gt;Jason Andrews&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;Stanford University&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the study’s authors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Growing Global Threat&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the majority of XDR typhoid cases originate in South Asia, particularly in &lt;strong&gt;Nepal&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Pakistan&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;India&lt;/strong&gt;, these resistant strains have already started spreading across the globe. Since 1990, nearly 200 cases of international spread have been identified, with these strains showing up in &lt;strong&gt;Southeast Asia&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/africa-is-breaking-apart-a-new-ocean-is-forming-at-breakneck-speed-faster-than-expected/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="78626" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;East and Southern Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and even in more developed regions such as the &lt;strong&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;United States&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Canada&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This rapid spread underscores the global nature of the problem, signaling that no country is safe from the consequences of resistant typhoid. The international transmission of these superbugs highlights a serious public health issue. “The recent emergence of XDR and azithromycin-resistant &lt;em&gt;S Typhi&lt;/em&gt; creates greater urgency for rapidly expanding prevention measures,” the authors of the study wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This global distribution of resistant strains suggests that without intervention, more countries could soon face outbreaks that may be difficult to control.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Shrinking Treatment Options&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the battle against typhoid fever becomes increasingly difficult, the number of effective treatments is steadily shrinking. Historically, &lt;strong&gt;azithromycin&lt;/strong&gt; was the last remaining oral antibiotic effective in treating typhoid fever. However, the study reveals that &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/physicist-claims-pandemic-virus-mutations-prove-were-living-in-a-simulated-universe/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="77040" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mutations&lt;/a&gt; conferring resistance to azithromycin are now spreading in parts of South Asia. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While these mutations have not yet fully developed in XDR strains, the research warns that if these &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/mice-with-a-human-gene-mutation-start-talking-differently-and-it-might-be-why-we-speak/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="79893" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mutations spread further&lt;/a&gt;, “threatening the efficacy of all oral antimicrobials for typhoid treatment,” it would leave healthcare systems with few viable options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The emergence of resistance to azithromycin has raised serious concerns, especially given that untreated typhoid fever can lead to fatal outcomes in up to 20% of cases. Currently, there are 11 million cases of typhoid annually, making this increasing resistance a critical issue for global health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Vaccination as a Critical Measure&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The urgency of expanding vaccination efforts has never been greater. In countries where antibiotic resistance is rampant, &lt;strong&gt;typhoid conjugate vaccines&lt;/strong&gt; could play a crucial role in controlling the spread of the disease. &lt;strong&gt;Pakistan&lt;/strong&gt; has already become a leader in this area, being the first nation to implement routine immunization for typhoid. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts argue that increasing access to these vaccines could significantly reduce the incidence of typhoid. A study in &lt;strong&gt;India&lt;/strong&gt; estimated that vaccinating children in urban areas could prevent up to &lt;strong&gt;36%&lt;/strong&gt; of typhoid cases and deaths, a potential lifesaver in regions most affected by the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In their study, the authors stress the need to expand vaccination programs in countries where antimicrobial resistance is high, but also to ensure global access to these vaccines. “Such measures are needed in countries where antimicrobial resistance prevalence among &lt;em&gt;S Typhi&lt;/em&gt; isolates is currently high, but given the propensity for international spread, should not be restricted to such settings,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccination remains one of the most effective ways to prevent typhoid, especially in light of the dwindling effectiveness of antibiotics. The researchers and health experts emphasize that swift and widespread vaccination efforts are essential to prevent future outbreaks and to curb the global spread of drug-resistant typhoid.&lt;/p&gt;

These treatments are known as “inverse vaccines” because they suppress a particular part of the immune system, rather than amplifying it, as existing vaccines do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This is the holy grail,” says Northwestern University immunologist Stephen Miller. “We want to use a scalpel rather than a sledgehammer to treat these diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Miller’s &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9053078/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2021 paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2022 in Gastroenterology, was the first to demonstrate that inverse vaccines could be effective in humans. The study looked at celiac disease, in which the immune system attacks the intestinal lining when it detects the presence of gluten, a protein found in wheat and other grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Over two weeks, 33 celiac patients who were in remission ingested gluten; about half had received the inverse vaccine beforehand, while the other half got a placebo. After two weeks, researchers examined the subjects’ intestinal lining and found that the inverse vaccine group had no damage, while the placebo group showed a noticeable worsening of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;It re-educates the immune system, so then it says: ‘OK, I’m good, I don’t need to attack this, because I see that it’s not a threat’&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jeffrey Hubbell, bioengineer&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The basic idea of inverse vaccines rests on using certain synthetic nanoparticles attached to particular disease-related proteins – called antigens – as targeted messengers to retrain the immune system. The nanoparticles mimic dying human cells, a normal ongoing process. Although these dying cells are “foreign”, the immune system knows not to attack them. The immune system learns to ignore both the nanoparticles and the attached proteins, and stops attacking the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“What this does is, it re-educates the immune system,” says NYU bioengineer Jeffrey Hubbell. “So then it says: ‘OK, I’m good, I don’t need to attack this, because I see that it’s not a threat.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In 2023, Hubbell and his colleagues &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-023-01086-2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published a peer-reviewed paper&lt;/a&gt; in Nature showing that this method could halt the mouse version of multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease in which the immune system attacks nerve cells in the brain and body. Over the past eight months, Anokion, the company started by Hubbell and others to commercialize their work, has announced successful early trials in humans in both &lt;a href="https://anokion.com/press_releases/anokion-announces-positive-symptom-data-from-its-phase-2-trial-evaluating-kan-101-for-the-treatment-of-celiac-disease/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;celiac disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://anokion.com/press_releases/anokion-announces-new-data-from-the-phase-1-moves-it-study-supporting-ank-700-as-a-novel-potential-disease-modifying-treatment-for-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;MS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There have been more than a few tears of happiness shed by me and my team when we’ve seen the clinical results,” Hubbell says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="72c4df1c-6f9b-40cc-9cfb-3b1348666f90" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":11,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Pollen is everywhere.

He was among the first scientists to uncover this. “I would never have guessed it,” he says. “Not even in my wildest dreams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Santamaria has spent most of his career focusing on type one diabetes, a disease in which the immune system attacks the pancreas cells that produce insulin. Recently though, he has begun exploring inverse vaccines for other autoimmune disorders, including a disease called primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) that affects bile ducts in the liver. One advantage of working on PBC is that because it is rare, clinical trials don’t require nearly as many patients; as a result, the drug approval process can move more quickly. “And once we get approval for one indication, we may be able to go faster with others,” Santamaria says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One of the key advantages of inverse vaccines is their broad versatility; it appears that the approach can work for a wide range of autoimmune diseases. “It works all the time in animals,” says Santamaria. “We’ve tried this in many different animal models of autoimmune disease.” (Of course, success in animal studies doesn’t automatically translate to success in humans.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Last year, Bana Jabri, the director of Institut Imagine in Paris, cowrote &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg7505" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a review of inverse vaccine efforts&lt;/a&gt;. She is cautiously optimistic about their potential, but also notes that the immune system is immensely complex. Some immune cells, for example, circulate throughout the body, while others reside permanently in specific tissues. Jabri says it’s not yet clear that current inverse immune treatments can affect both kinds of cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-16" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They may work for allergies, which also involve an overreaction by the immune system – in this case to a food or environmental trigger rather than one’s own body. In 2022, Miller and his colleague, University of Michigan biomedical engineer Lonnie Shea, published a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35386645/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; with mice with peanut allergy. The animals who received an inverse vaccine were able to consume significantly more peanuts without symptoms than those who did not get the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Last month, Hubbell and several colleagues published a paper in Science Translational Medicine&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;showing that their inverse vaccine could protect allergic mice from house dust mite antigens, a frequent cause of asthma, as well as antigens to chicken egg whites, a common experimental model for allergy. The protection held up through repeated exposures to the allergens over several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;And last year, Shea, the University of Michigan the biomedical engineer, published a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/allergy/articles/10.3389/falgy.2024.1437523/full" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; looking at alpha-gal syndrome, a potentially severe allergy to meat caused by tick bites. Infected mice who were given an inverse vaccine showed significantly fewer symptoms than those who were given a placebo. “We were able to basically convince the immune system that these proteins are not dangerous,” Shea says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="1ef737fb-7045-4c0a-97f2-93aa914d8758" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":21,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"I was sufficiently vaccinated against measles in childhood – or so I thought","elementId":"1ef737fb-7045-4c0a-97f2-93aa914d8758","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/apr/09/measles-vaccination-adulthood"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At this point, it is difficult to say how long it will be before inverse vaccines are approved for human use. Miller, Shea, Hubbell, Santamaria and other researchers are involved in startup biotech companies working to develop them. Some larger pharmaceutical companies are also bullish on the approach, and are partnering with startups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In December, Genentech announced a partnership with Cour, the company started by Miller and Shea, that could be &lt;a href="https://www.biospace.com/business/roche-partners-with-cour-in-autoimmune-deal-potentially-worth-more-than-900m" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;worth up to $900m&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, Parvus, the startup founded by Santamaria, entered into a &lt;a href="https://parvustx.com/parvus-announces-collaboration-with-abbvie-to-develop-ibd-therapies-based-on-the-parvus-navacim-platform-technology/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;collaboration with the pharmaceutical company AbbVie&lt;/a&gt;. Several inverse vaccines are now in the midst of or about to start phase two trials, small studies looking at how effective the treatment is in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some scientists estimate that the first inverse vaccines could be available for use in three to five years. Others are less certain. “I think it will take 10 years to have it nailed down,” Jabri says. “But it could be shorter, or it could be longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Even so, nearly all are optimistic. “Twenty years ago, I would have told you this wasn’t possible, absolutely not,” says Miller. “Today, I can say that it will happen. No doubt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxNa3hNWWtxaFBWWF9CQVJXVUZwVzZrajlQTHRRLWxQQ0c1b25uU3hqTnpKWC1wTGlQZ1dEc19RaU12Nk5XUXBVaFZRTUFvMmZPaERrV01nNWFOcmpRTHBscHNMR1kyMkNBbzdFVlpITFZzY3lqM2RXZlBOa0Yzd2M2NW5sNkx3TkVoblplUA</guid></item><item><title>HIV药物显著降低阿尔茨海默病风险，研究结果- ScienceAlert | HIV Drugs Dramatically Lower Risk of Alzheimer's Disease, Study Finds - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNOGhHbDg2MjlYbG1JYXowTjVUX3hUQ0ItSGhLYnUtYVZSSEVEME01eWlDVS1WcXc0ZmNpWHVQcjJLZVZ1M2hRaDN3M1NOQURzTTJFb1NuTHlILXZsaTNvbGI4c3U5Y0hwQjJNTTNpeEdvbXVSYXJtcTBBM0gzRTltLU90NE1GcmhWblU3YXF0UjJ0bkt4OG1Ba2R6ZWE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Scientists have identified a promising new class of treatments for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="160941" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, and they're already widely used to treat  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hiv" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73049" data-postid="160941" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; and hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with their antiretroviral effects, drugs called nucleoside &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse-transcriptase_inhibitor"&gt;reverse transcriptase inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; (NRTIs) inhibit the activation of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammasome"&gt;inflammasomes&lt;/a&gt;, which, as the name suggests, are mechanisms that trigger inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This inflammasome blocking was the reason the US research team was looking at NRTIs. They analyzed information from two large health insurance databases in the US on 271,198 people aged over 50 with either HIV or hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The individuals in this group with a history of taking NRTIs &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70180"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; "significant and substantial reductions" in their risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-early-speech-related-signs-youre-at-risk-of-alzheimers-disease"&gt;developing Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, compared to those who were receiving different treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_160944" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160944" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SurvivalChart.jpg" alt="Dementia chart" class="wp-image-160944 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SurvivalChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SurvivalChart-477x415.jpg 477w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SurvivalChart-600x522.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-160944" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers mapped the development of Alzheimer's over time in groups of people with and without exposure to NRTI treatment. (Magagnoli et al., &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer's Dement.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Veterans Health Administration database, composed of mainly older males, that reduction in risk was 6 percent for every year of taking NRTIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.merative.com/documents/merative-marketscan-research-databases"&gt;MarketScan database&lt;/a&gt;, which the team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70180"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; includes "a broader, commercially insured population with a more balanced age and sex distribution", showed that risk reduction was 13 percent for every year of NRTIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not a direct sign of cause and effect due to the observational nature of the study, but it's a strong association that's well worth investigating further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The reduction in risk was observed in two large, diverse health insurance databases after correcting for numerous comorbidities known to be associated with Alzheimer's disease," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70180"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammasomes act like alarms triggering inflammation in the body, and are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ni.1636"&gt;thought to be involved&lt;/a&gt; in the way Alzheimer's takes hold in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While scientists aren't sure exactly how Alzheimer's gets started, it's clear that neuroinflammation &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-sleeping-pill-could-reduce-buildup-of-alzheimers-proteins-study-finds"&gt;triggered by the buildup&lt;/a&gt; of amyloid-beta and tau proteins is somehow involved, and could give us a way into treating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repurposing existing drugs offers one way of developing Alzheimer's treatments more quickly, and the researchers behind this new study now want to see  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="160941" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; of NRTIs for Alzheimer's. Work is already underway to tackle some of the side effects &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hiv-aids/nucleoside-nucleotide-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitors"&gt;that can come&lt;/a&gt; with these drugs, which include liver problems and impacts on the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have also developed a new inflammasome-blocking drug called K9, which is a safer and more effective version of NRTIs," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uvahealth.com/2025/05/08/hiv-drugs-offer-substantial-alzheimers-protection/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; ophthalmologist Jayakrishna Ambati, from the University of Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This drug is already in clinical trials for other diseases, and we plan to also test K9 in Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're now seeing regular progress in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-may-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-says-expert"&gt;understanding more&lt;/a&gt; about Alzheimer's and developing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-a-critical-thing-we-can-do-to-keep-alzheimers-symptoms-at-bay"&gt;potential treatments&lt;/a&gt; for the disease. While this latest study only looked at people with specific medical conditions, the findings are notable enough to justify broader research into ways of regulating inflammation in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's estimated that over 10 million people around the world develop Alzheimer's disease annually," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uvahealth.com/2025/05/08/hiv-drugs-offer-substantial-alzheimers-protection/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Ambati. "Our results suggest that taking these drugs could prevent approximately 1 million new cases of Alzheimer's disease every year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70180"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite their ability to enhance focus and wakefulness, health experts are increasingly voicing their concerns regarding the potential dangers these drinks pose, especially to the younger population who are their primary consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annabel Gipp, a registered dietitian and contributing writer for the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bda.uk.com/resource/energy-drinks-and-young-people.html#:~:text=Physical%20effects%20of%20high%20enery,disturbances%2C%20headaches%20and%20stomach%20aches" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;British Dietetic Association (BDA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, has outlined the serious adverse effects associated with energy drinks, largely stemming from their high caffeine content. Gipp elaborates, stating, "Increased caffeine consumption among children and adolescents leads to elevated blood pressure, disrupting sleep patterns, causing severe headaches, and inducing stomach disturbances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also self-reported instances of injuries linked to hyperactivity triggered by these drinks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these immediate effects, Gipp stresses the long-term implications: "Adolescence is a critical period for bone development, and caffeine has been shown to hinder calcium absorption in the small intestine, potentially resulting in lower calcium deposition in bones. This detrimental effect is exacerbated when energy drinks are consumed in place of calcium-rich alternatives like milk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per a comprehensive 2023 review published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/11/2537" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; journal, which analyzed 18 different reports detailing the adverse health effects tied to energy drinks among individuals under 18, it was found that nearly half of the incidents involved cardiovascular issues. These included serious conditions such as heart arrhythmia and arterial hypertension. Furthermore, neuropsychological problems accounted for one-third of the analyzed cases, while 22% reported kidney-related concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings indicated that pre-existing medical conditions played a role in 44% of the analyzed incidents. In fact, the researchers noted, "Cardiovascular adverse health events were documented in 45% of the incidences, including alarming conditions such as cardiac arrhythmia, arterial hypertension, acute coronary artery vasospasm, and spontaneous coronary artery dissection." In some cases, the affected individuals had consumed substantial amounts of energy drinks over several days, while one notable incident involved a healthy adolescent experiencing significant cardiovascular repercussions after consuming only a moderate amount of caffeine (80 mg).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further illustrating the potential dangers, the study cited a case from 2011 involving a teenager who suffered from acute renal failure linked to energy drink consumption. The authors pointed to the high taurine levels in these products as a potential contributing factor, noting that "approximately 95% of taurine is metabolized in the kidneys." They highlighted how the consumption of energy drinks might lead to arterial hypertension, metabolic disorders associated with sugar, and weight gain, all of which are recognized risk factors for chronic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to physical health impacts, a recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/articles/latest/2024/01/energydrinksandchildrensmentalhealth/#:~:text=Energy%20drinks%20are%20associated%20with,a%20new%20study%20has%20found." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in the Public Health journal revealed a troubling correlation between energy drink consumption and mental health issues in children and young adults. The study analyzed data from 57 diverse studies encompassing over 1.2 million participants from more than 21 different countries, identifying significant associations with anxiety, stress, depression, and even suicidal ideation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shelina Visram, a senior public health lecturer from Fuse, Newcastle University, and co-author of the study, expressed grave concern over these findings. "We are extremely worried about the implications that energy drinks can lead to psychological distress and mental health challenges. These findings represent crucial public health issues that must be addressed promptly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, researchers have lamented the lack of regulatory action surrounding energy drinks, arguing that their widespread availability to children and adolescents is jeopardizing their health. Professor Amelia Lake, the lead author of the study, stated, "Energy drinks are being marketed to children and young people as a means to enhance their energy and performance levels, yet our research indicates they may be causing more harm than benefit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She further noted, "We have raised alarms about the health consequences of these drinks for nearly a decade, highlighting that they are sold to children as young as ten years old for prices as low as 25 pence—cheaper than bottled water." The growing body of evidence suggests that energy drinks pose significant risks not only to the mental and physical health of children and adolescents but also to their behavior and academic performance.Urgent action is needed to mitigate these risks and protect young individuals from the harmful effects of these products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the alternatives to energy drinks?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthier alternatives to energy drinks include herbal teas, natural fruit juices, coconut water, and just plain water. These options provide hydration, essential nutrients, and a moderate energy boost without the negative effects of excessive caffeine or sugar. Additionally, foods like dark chocolate, green tea, and goji berries can also offer a natural energy boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Sugar-sweetened drinks related to chronic kidney disease, says study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 04:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>哈佛大学训练有素的营养学家分享了一个将碳水化合物血糖指数降低50%的简单技巧--印度时报 | Harvard-trained nutritionist shares a simple trick to cut the glycemic index of carbs by 50 percent - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAJBVV95cUxQNjV3NGdxZTZCeVlHVHhCa2FZX0JPUkt5dzg4MEZtdTJmbGZPbElVRFhyTUEteXAwNmJFRG9kRERLQXA5RlBLOXFvUnc3REt4TE9nZ1RTSUFEZG9HNDF2VDRqSTZDOG8talh2M1ZrakxBLXFLbW5QdzJBUzJGMlFReVc0VEI2VnkwUlVQNnNFdlB0dGhTTXo0VmY5eHRDaWhZTndVVmVRNnhyekp1QTdaaE9EY0o4SWNIRm5pNEZuT05RcWNvbUVoTFdSVGdzZ2R0ZTh6MDI1X2IyOFhOYzR1dWlBUW5lU0FMX3hSYUdsTVpTblVCc0VIUmZ1SHdIaHM0Ul82VFMtaEp3RGlrMEpJRWNwQzBMYnlGQXBIYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if you can eat rice and yet not have a drastic blood sugar spike?

Not anymore! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you can have your carb and eat it! Yes, that’s right! Dr. Terry Shintani, MD, a Harvard-trained nutritionist with a massive social media following of over 250K, has shared a surprisingly simple method to cut the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/glycemic-index" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;glycemic index&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; (GI) of common carbohydrates by up to 50%, potentially transforming how people manage blood sugar and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we delve into the technique, let’s take a moment to understand what the glycemic index is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates are an essential part of a healthy diet. These include your breads, cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and dairy products. What happens when you eat foods that have carbohydrates in them? Your digestive system breaks it down into simple sugars, and that enters the bloodstream. Different carbs have different effects on &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/common-foods-that-can-silently-increase-blood-sugar/articleshow/118817066.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a cookie in the morning can cause a sugar spike in your blood, leaving you wanting to eat more and more carbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glycemic index (GI) is a measure of the increase in the level of blood glucose (a type of sugar) caused by eating a specific carbohydrate (food that contains sugar) compared with eating a standard amount of glucose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods that have a high glycemic index release glucose quickly and cause a rapid rise in blood glucose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods with a low glycemic index release glucose slowly into the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glycemic index (GI) affects your body by influencing how quickly carbohydrates raise blood sugar levels. High-GI foods (70+) cause rapid blood sugar spikes, triggering a quick insulin release to regulate glucose. This can lead to energy crashes, increased hunger, and, over time, may contribute to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. Low-GI foods (55 or below) digest more slowly, providing steadier energy, better blood sugar control, and reduced risk of chronic diseases.The GI’s impact also depends on portion size, meal composition (fiber, protein, fats), and individual metabolic responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Terry Shintani has now revealed an unbelievably simple technique that can lower the GI of carb staples like rice, bread, potatoes, and pasta. “Yes, you can cut the glycemic index of common carbs by as much as 50%,” he said in a video shared on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Here's the secret to lowering the glycemic index of common carbs and it helps you control blood sugar. It's unbelievably simple. Just heat it and cool it,” the nutritionist revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Dr. Shintani recommends cooling the cooked rice in the fridge overnight and then reheating it. “Its glycemic index drops from 78 down to 54,” he says. In case you fancy a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/glass-in-bread-bug-in-beans-and-tomatoes-5-essential-food-items-recalled-across-the-us-due-to-contamination/articleshow/121079817.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;toast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in the morning, the best way to lower the blood sugar spike is to freeze it and then toast it. The nutritionist reveals that this process lowers its glycemic index by up to 39%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For potatoes, cooking, cooling, and reheating can reduce their glycemic index by 30 to 40%. And for pasta, chilling and reheating can cut the glycemic index by up to 50%,” he suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Prince Harry BLASTED For ‘Deadly’ Claims About Royal Family – Friends OUTRAGED Over King Charles Health Reveal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what happens when you cool the cooked carbs and reheat them? “The process of heating and cooling carbs causes a cross-linkage and restructuring of the starch, turning some of it into resistant starches. This slows the digestion of the starch and causes a slower release of sugar into the bloodstream. So, try this simple hack on your carbs to keep your blood sugar in check,” the nutritionist suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 03:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAJBVV95cUxQNjV3NGdxZTZCeVlHVHhCa2FZX0JPUkt5dzg4MEZtdTJmbGZPbElVRFhyTUEteXAwNmJFRG9kRERLQXA5RlBLOXFvUnc3REt4TE9nZ1RTSUFEZG9HNDF2VDRqSTZDOG8talh2M1ZrakxBLXFLbW5QdzJBUzJGMlFReVc0VEI2VnkwUlVQNnNFdlB0dGhTTXo0VmY5eHRDaWhZTndVVmVRNnhyekp1QTdaaE9EY0o4SWNIRm5pNEZuT05RcWNvbUVoTFdSVGdzZ2R0ZTh6MDI1X2IyOFhOYzR1dWlBUW5lU0FMX3hSYUdsTVpTblVCc0VIUmZ1SHdIaHM0Ul82VFMtaEp3RGlrMEpJRWNwQzBMYnlGQXBIYw</guid></item><item><title>“完美风暴” ：专家揭示为什么花粉过敏越来越严重- ScienceAlert | 'Perfect Storm': Expert Reveals Why Pollen Allergies Are Getting Worse - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOYzZZVm9pZDJjUEdKZTNOZ3BWTlBJa0FfWV9RZGx6VU1RMzZyWmw4OElIcnFCQzFGTUJqUEY3U0dBSmVsV1Z0MG5wdjNmaGRWMHVUV0lkYi1tcUo1TDhmTXNHS2Y2M2JkdXdjbkpTZ19VaU9GN21DMF9EYVBZR2tteUZYMUtyMk13Nlo1WGlhTTBHX0JNTXZVQVVNWVU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Evolution has fostered many reproductive strategies across the spectrum of life. From dandelions to giraffes, nature finds a way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those ways creates quite a bit of suffering for humans: pollen, the infamous &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC159801/pdf/010657.pdf"&gt;male gametophyte&lt;/a&gt; of the plant kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Southeastern U.S., where I live, you know it's spring &lt;a href="https://www.fox10tv.com/2025/03/31/expert-pollen-can-damage-car-paint-lead-air-filter-problems/"&gt;when your car has turned yellow&lt;/a&gt; and pollen blankets your patio furniture and anything else left outside. Suddenly there are long lines at every car wash in town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A car covered in yellow.

&lt;p&gt;So, why is there so much pollen? And why does it seem to be getting worse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2 ways trees spread their pollen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trees don't have an easy time in the reproductive game. As a tree, you have two options to disperse your pollen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Option 1: Employ an agent, such as a butterfly or bee, that can &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/honey-bees-fill-saddlebags-pollen-here-s-how-they-keep-them-gripped-tight"&gt;carry your pollen&lt;/a&gt; to another plant of the same species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside of this option is that you must invest in a showy flower display and a sweet scent to advertise yourself, and sugary nectar to pay your agent for its services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A bee noses into a white flower." src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/664220/original/file-20250428-56-xi5laz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/664220/original/file-20250428-56-xi5laz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/664220/original/file-20250428-56-xi5laz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/664220/original/file-20250428-56-xi5laz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/664220/original/file-20250428-56-xi5laz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=503&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/664220/original/file-20250428-56-xi5laz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=503&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/664220/original/file-20250428-56-xi5laz.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=503&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A bee enjoys pollen from a cherry blossom. Pollen is a primary source of protein for bees. (&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/26344495@N05/49811171356"&gt;Ivan Radic/Flickr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"&gt;CC BY&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Option 2, the budget option, is much less precise: Get a free ride on the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wind was the original pollinator, evolving long before animal-mediated pollination. Wind doesn't require a showy flower nor a nectar reward. What it does require for pollination to succeed is &lt;a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/wildflowers/pollinators/wind.shtml"&gt;ample amounts of lightweight&lt;/a&gt;, small-diameter pollen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why wind-blown pollen makes allergies worse&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wind is not an efficient pollinator, however. The probability of one pollen grain &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73637-5"&gt;landing in the right location&lt;/a&gt; – the stigma or ovule of another plant of the same species – is infinitesimally small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, wind-pollinated trees must compensate for this inefficiency by producing copious amounts of pollen, and it must be light enough to be carried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For allergy sufferers, that can mean air filled with microscopic pollen grains that can get into your eyes, throat and lungs, sneak in through window screens and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/pollen-allergy"&gt;convince your immune system&lt;/a&gt; that you've inhaled a dangerous intruder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="Tiny flowers on a live oak tree." src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/664212/original/file-20250427-56-4hh6b3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;rect=9%2C3%2C2035%2C1462&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/664212/original/file-20250427-56-4hh6b3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=450&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/664212/original/file-20250427-56-4hh6b3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=450&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/664212/original/file-20250427-56-4hh6b3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=450&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/664212/original/file-20250427-56-4hh6b3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=566&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/664212/original/file-20250427-56-4hh6b3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=566&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/664212/original/file-20250427-56-4hh6b3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=566&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;When wind blows the tiny pollen grains of live oaks, allergy sufferers feel it.

So don't blame the bees for your allergies – it's really the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climate change has a role here, too&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plants initiate pollen release based on a few factors, including temperature and light cues. Many of our temperate tree species respond to cues that signal the beginning of spring, including warmer temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have found that pollen seasons have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2013284118"&gt;intensified in the past three decades&lt;/a&gt; as the climate has warmed. One study that examined 60 location across North America found pollen seasons expanded by an average of 20 days from 1990 to 2018 and pollen concentrations increased by 21%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not all. Increasing carbon dioxide levels may also be driving &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00484-018-1558-7"&gt;increases in the quantity of tree pollen produced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why the Southeast gets socked&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What could make this pollen boost even worse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Southeastern U.S. in particular, strong windstorms are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-22-0027.1"&gt;becoming more common and more intense&lt;/a&gt; − and not just hurricanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has lived in the Southeast for the past couple of decades has likely noticed this. The region has &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/tornadoes-climate-change-and-why-dixie-is-the-new-tornado-alley-178863"&gt;more tornado warnings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41612-018-0048-2"&gt;more severe thunderstorms&lt;/a&gt;, more power outages.

(&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/gis/svrgis/"&gt;Christine Cairns Fortuin&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since wind is the vector of airborne pollen, windier conditions can also make allergies worse. Pollen remains airborne for longer on windy days, and it travels farther.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, increasing storm activity may be doing more than just transporting pollen. Storms can also break apart pollen grains, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.0c00213"&gt;creating smaller particles&lt;/a&gt; that can penetrate deeper into the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many allergy sufferers may notice worsening allergies during storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The peak of spring wind and storm season tends to correspond to the timing of the release of tree pollen that blankets our world in yellow.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yogurt can be a great addition to your diet if you know what to look for (and what to avoid).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts suggest yogurts that offer protein and probiotics while being low in added sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietary fat from dairy (like yogurt) might not be as problematic as was once thought.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to yogurt, it’s easier to tell that some products are inherently healthier than others. A tub of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252990/homemade-plain-greek-yogurt/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plain Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is a far cry from something that is studded with brownies and tastes suspiciously like ice cream. Still, there’s more to choosing a good-for-you yogurt than you might expect—and clever marketing can add an extra layer of uncertainty. Meanwhile, the debate around the merits of whole-fat versus low-fat dairy continues to add to the confusion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Want to select a creamy treat that’ll really do your body good? We asked five nutrition experts for their top tips on identifying healthy yogurts. Here’s what they had to say.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-yogurt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look For In a Yogurt &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; High Protein Content &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though there’s no need to go overboard on protein, this macro has plenty of merit for health. “Protein is essential for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8021161/what-to-eat-to-build-muscle/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;muscle repair&lt;/a&gt;, and it helps keep you full while supporting a healthy metabolism,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurenklein12/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lauren Klein, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. It just so happens that yogurt can make a great choice for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-add-10-grams-of-protein-to-your-meals-11715637" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;boosting your protein intake&lt;/a&gt;. Many yogurts are loaded with the stuff!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before you purchase, look for a yogurt’s protein content by scanning its &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-i-check-first-on-the-nutrition-label-8548484" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrition facts label&lt;/a&gt;. A yogurt with 10 grams or more (per serving) is considered high-protein since it supplies 20% of the Daily Value of 50 grams.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember, too, that the type of milk and style of yogurt can make a major difference to protein content. “Yogurt made from real milk is a good source of high-quality protein,” points out &lt;a href="https://www.examroomnutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Colleen Sloan, PA-C, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. A single-serve tub of high-protein dairy yogurt like Icelandic skyr, for example, typically contains three times the protein of an almond milk-based yogurt.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That said, plant-based options like soy yogurt can also bring the protein with about 7 grams per single-serve container.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Low Added Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s good advice, no matter &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; food you’re selecting: check &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;added sugars&lt;/a&gt; before you consume. Overdoing it on the sweet stuff can put the “hurt” in “yoghurt,” since too much sugar in the diet may increase the risk of chronic diseases, says Klein. How much is too much? The American Heart Association recommends that men limit their intake to 9 teaspoons (36 grams) of added sugars per day, and women should aim for less than 6 teaspoons (25 grams) per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Eating sweetened yogurt often can cause you to exceed these recommendations without realizing it,” says Klein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ingredients like cookie pieces, sprinkles, and chocolate are easy to spot, of course, but check labels to determine what you’re getting. Even innocuous-seeming fruit yogurts may get more of their sweetness from added sugars than real fruits. “You can look for plain yogurt instead of flavored yogurt to help you limit added sugar, then add some fresh fruit like berries or bananas,” suggests &lt;a href="http://melissatraub.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Melissa Altman-Traub, M.S., RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Live and Active Cultures &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Every yogurt is made with bacterial strains, but in some cases, heat treatment kills them off during processing, meaning they no longer provide benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To ensure you’re choosing a yogurt with the digestive health boost of probiotics, look for the "Live &amp;amp; Active Cultures" seal from the National Yogurt Association, recommends &lt;a href="https://www.andreaballenthin.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Andrea Ballenthin, M.S., CNS, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This seal means that a yogurt brand has at least 100 million cultures per gram at the time it’s manufactured, she says. “These beneficial bacteria support digestion by helping break down food and enhancing nutrient absorption, while also replenishing the gut’s healthy microbes.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; High in Essential Nutrients &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Did you know &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7944074/foods-with-more-calcium-than-milk/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt; isn’t the only mineral yogurt provides? Yogurt can also be a source of phosphorus, vitamin B12, riboflavin, and potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Sloan recommends checking labels for the presence of these important minerals. “These nutrients contribute to bone health, energy metabolism and overall nutrient adequacy.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Appropriate Fat Content for Your Needs &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For years, health guidance around dairy foods focused on choosing lower-fat versions whenever possible. But today’s up-to-the-minute research shows that dairy fat isn’t the bogeyman it was once believed to be. “Depending on your dietary goals, both low-fat and whole-milk yogurts can be healthy choices,” says Sloan. “Research shows that neither full-fat nor low-fat dairy products are associated with weight gain.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you enjoy the richness of a high-fat yogurt, it can be a good choice for promoting feelings of satisfaction and satiety. “Maintaining a little bit of fat in yogurt helps it taste creamier without excess sugar,” says &lt;a href="https://dietitiankerry.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kerry Hackworth, M.S., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Also, fat helps absorb certain vitamins and helps to round out your meal.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the other hand, the American Heart Association continues to recommend non-fat or low-fat yogurt for heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If your doctor or dietitian has advised you to stick with a low-fat diet, it’s important to abide by their guidance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-tips-for-enjoying-yogurt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Tips for Enjoying Yogurt &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you’ve selected a healthy yogurt, it’s time to put it to good use! With creamy texture and easy blendability, yogurt is among the most versatile foods on the planet. Enjoy it with these expert-recommended tips:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind the portion size&lt;/strong&gt;. However you eat your yogurt, keep portions in mind. To balance calories and nutrient intake, Sloan recommends sticking to a standard serving of yogurt, about ¾ cup to 1 cup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250955/strawberry-yogurt-parfait/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fruit and yogurt parfait&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; “Adding fruit is a great way to enjoy yogurt!” says Klein. “This will add natural sweetness, color and fiber and makes for a powerfully satiating snack.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use it as a topping. &lt;/strong&gt;Sure, you can dollop yogurt on savory dishes like tacos and chilis—but Altman-Traub encourages using it on sweeter foods like pancakes or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7985443/oatmeal-waffles/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;waffles&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it a dip. &lt;/strong&gt;Hackworth says she enjoys adding spices and seasonings to transform yogurt into an easy, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250924/avocado-yogurt-dip/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;protein-packed dip&lt;/a&gt; for veggies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use it in baking&lt;/strong&gt;. “Yogurt tenderizes the protein in flour, resulting in soft-to-the-bite &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8066253/high-protein-lemon-blueberry-muffins/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;muffins&lt;/a&gt;, pastries or cakes,” says Sloan. “Its slightly acidic flavor adds a bit of tang.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yogurt is undeniably a healthy food, but the ingredients it contains can either elevate or detract from its overall nutritional impact. A product with a pile of added candy pieces and falling short on protein won’t offer the same nutritional benefits as a low-sugar variety made from high-protein milk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When making a selection at the store, be sure to turn tubs around to compare nutrition facts labels and ingredient lists. They tell the true story of yogurt’s healthfulness, providing details about protein, sugar, fat and micronutrients.&lt;br&gt;

"You can get the protein that you need from vegetables and lean meats."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He believes the convenience of high-protein snacks, combined with the positive perception of the nutrient among customers, has led to manufacturers using protein as a marketing tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For manufacturers to claim their product is a source of protein, they must show regulators at least 12% of its energy value is provided by protein. To make a claim that a product is high in protein, the figure is 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;To help reach these scores they can add protein-rich ingredients to their products, like nuts and pulses, or make them more dense by removing water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"When someone in a rush is getting a meal deal for lunch, you can see why they would reach for a protein bar or drink instead of two boiled eggs," he says. "In my 12 years as a personal trainer, I've never seen as much hype around the benefits of protein as I am now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The benefits of protein range from muscle building and sports performance to helping with weight loss by suppressing appetite and helping women during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;If you're trying to build muscle you need to consume around 1.6g of protein per kilogram of your body weight each day, says Dr Paul Morgan, a university lecturer in human nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He says for the average person trying to ensure their general health, this figure should be around 1.2g.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He thinks many of the supermarket products advertising their protein content are "gimmicky" and warns they might not be as good for you as advertised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I think they do have a benefit but we are wary that a lot of them are ultra processed foods and that's a really topical area [in our field] that we don't know enough about," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;The risk of consuming too much protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ultra-processed foods have come under scrutiny recently with &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crm30kwvv17o" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;one study published last month linking them to early death.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He explains that researchers in his field are trying to understand the differing impact on muscles that two similar protein sources might have when one of them is ultra-processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Another issue is calories because putting on weight is the most common problem people have when they are trying to consume more protein, Dr Morgan explains, as any excess is stored in the body as fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some protein advertised snacks and drinks can have as many calories as regular products using similar ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Nature Valley's protein peanut and chocolate bars have 489kcal per 100g, while Cadbury's peanut brunch bars, which also contain chocolate, have 485kcal at the same weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Morgan dismisses theories that eating too much protein can damage your bones or harm your kidneys, though there are exceptions if you have a pre-existing health condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250428-123652-7bc49a8f4-web-2.20.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/63c3/live/5fb02d80-276f-11f0-9ebe-cd0e86e27cba.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/63c3/live/5fb02d80-276f-11f0-9ebe-cd0e86e27cba.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/63c3/live/5fb02d80-276f-11f0-9ebe-cd0e86e27cba.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/63c3/live/5fb02d80-276f-11f0-9ebe-cd0e86e27cba.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/63c3/live/5fb02d80-276f-11f0-9ebe-cd0e86e27cba.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/63c3/live/5fb02d80-276f-11f0-9ebe-cd0e86e27cba.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/63c3/live/5fb02d80-276f-11f0-9ebe-cd0e86e27cba.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/63c3/live/5fb02d80-276f-11f0-9ebe-cd0e86e27cba.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A woman lifting weights in the gym.

The normal penne costs £1.29 per kg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So is it worth buying these protein advertised products?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It might be if you're someone who needs more protein to maintain your health or if you're trying to build muscle and need just a little bit extra to meet your daily protein goal, says Ethan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"If the majority of your diet is whole foods and you need that extra 20g of protein to hit your goal and want something sweet - then go for that pudding or snack," he tells us.

      &lt;p&gt;FARGO — The North Dakota Health and Human Services Department said two measles cases have been reported in Cass County, the first to be recorded in eastern North Dakota. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human services said both cases are unvaccinated individuals who contracted the disease through international travel. One of them is hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;The health and human services department said members of the public who were at two Essentia Health locations in West Fargo and Fargo may have been exposed. Exposure may have occurred at the Essentia Health Clinic, 3150 Sheyenne St., Ste. 240, West Fargo, between 2:30 and 6 p.m. on Wednesday, May 7, or between 5:30 and 6 p.m., Friday, May 9, at the Essentia Health Walk-in Care, 52nd Avenue, 4110 51st Ave. S, Fargo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two new cases bring the total cases reported in the state to 11. The Cass County cases are not believed to be related to the nine cases recently reported near Williston, in Williams County. 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.inforum.com/news/north-dakota/north-dakota-reports-first-measles-case-amid-declining-vaccination-rates" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;The first case was reported Friday,&lt;/a&gt;
    
       May 2, when the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services said an unvaccinated child from Williams County contracted the virus, likely during an out-of-state visit. The number jumped to nine by Friday, May 9. Four of the individuals were contagious while inside three different Williston schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who have not received a dose of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine should quarantine, or stay home, and monitor for symptoms for 21 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who have been exposed but are vaccinated do not need to quarantine. However, the department of health and human services said they should still monitor for symptoms for 21 days after exposure.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious, viral illness that can be fatal, particularly for young children and those with compromised immune systems. Measles spreads through the air and can remain in a room and on surfaces for up to two hours, sometimes even traveling between floors through ventilation systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms often include a fever, cough, runny nose or eye irritation followed by a body-wide rash. Measles spreads easily through the air and remains contagious for several days before and after symptoms appear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no specific medical treatment for measles, though antibiotics may be used in cases with a developed secondary bacterial infection.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;According to the state health department, most North Dakotans are vaccinated against measles, and the risk to the general public is low. People who were vaccinated as children and adults born before 1957 are considered protected due to previous infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The MMR vaccine is 93% effective after one dose and 97% effective after two doses,” Molly Howell, state immunization director, said in a statement. “People who are vaccinated and exposed to measles are not likely to develop the disease. MMR vaccination is critical to preventing the spread of measles in the community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MMR vaccine is recommended starting at 12 to 15 months of age, with a second dose at 4 to 6 years of age. Children who have already received two post-12-month doses of MMR are considered fully vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For information about measles, vaccination, or local clinic availability, contact the HHS Immunization Unit at 701-328-2378 or 711 (TTY), or visit hhs.nd.gov/measles.&lt;/p&gt;

                Our newsroom occasionally reports stories under a byline of "staff." Often, the "staff" byline is used when rewriting basic news briefs that originate from official sources, such as a city press release about a road closure, and which require little or no reporting. At times, this byline is used when a news story includes numerous authors or when the story is formed by aggregating previously reported news from various sources. If outside sources are used, it is noted within the story.
            &lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Obesity is associated with &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(24)00201-1/fulltext#:~:text=A%20report%20from%20the%20International,pancreas%2C%20breast%20(postmenopausal)%2C" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;13 different cancers&lt;/a&gt;. While losing weight reduces that risk, scientists have calculated weight-loss injections have a bigger protective effect over and above shedding the kilos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers in Israel studied 6,000 adults with no prior history of cancer, who either underwent bariatric surgery or took glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) liraglutide (Saxenda), exenatide (Byetta) or dulaglutide (Trulicity). The drugs work by mimicking the GLP-1 hormone in the body, which lowers blood sugar levels and makes people feel fuller for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although those who had bariatric surgery lost around double the weight of those on weight-loss medication, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.%201016/j.eclinm.2025.%20103213" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, presented at the European Congress on Obesity in Malaga, Spain, and published in The Lancet’s eClinicalMedicine, found the reduction in cancer risk was broadly the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bariatric surgery reduces the risk of cancer by 30-42%, the researchers said. Therefore, accounting for the relative advantage of surgery in reducing patients’ weight, the authors found weight-loss drugs were more effective at preventing obesity-related cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The protective effects of GLP-1RAs against obesity-related cancers likely arise from multiple mechanisms, including reducing inflammation,” said co-lead author Prof Dror Dicker from Hasharon Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Newer drugs could prove even more beneficial, he added. “New generation, highly potent GLP-1RAs with higher efficacy in weight reduction may convey an even greater advantage in reducing the risk of obesity-related cancers, but future research is needed to make sure these drugs do not increase the risk for non-obesity-related cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A separate &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2416394" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, presented at the conference and published in New England Journal of Medicine, directly compared weight-loss jabs and found patients taking Mounjaro lost about 50% more weight than those taking Wegovy. Patients on Mounjaro typically saw a 20.2% drop in body weight at the end of the trial compared with 13.7% with Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Responding to the findings, Prof Mark Lawler, an internationally renowned cancer research expert from Queen’s University Belfast, said while this was an observational study and caution was needed interpreting the results, the results were very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We already know bariatric surgery cuts obesity-related cancer risk by about a third; these data suggest target GLP-1s may cut that risk by nearly 50% – an approach that would be transformational in preventing obesity-related cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Biologically, this makes sense, as targeting GLP-1 dampens down inflammation, one of the hallmarks of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“While further work is required on how it works, these data raise the intriguing possibility that a GLP-1 jab could prevent multiple cancers in the general population, including common cancers like breast and colorectal, and difficult to treat cancers like pancreatic and ovarian. This work could herald a whole new era of preventive cancer medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Jason Halford, former president of the European Association for the Study of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/obesity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; and head of psychology at Leeds University, said the drugs should also be tested in patients with newly diagnosed cancers to see if they boosted survival chances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He added the drugs had “the potential to be a new dawn. And it’s not just prevention, weight management in people recently diagnosed with cancer is also critical in terms of outcomes. That would be the next thing to look at. More and more cancers are being associated with obesity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A team of 54 international experts from 12 different countries issued a joint statement at the conference, calling for weight-loss drugs to be trialled as a priority for cancer prevention. As a result, a UK team of scientists, based at the University of Manchester and funded by Cancer Research UK, are planning a large-scale clinical trial involving tens of thousands of patients, which they hope to get under way within “three to five years”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Matthew Harris, at the Manchester Cancer Research Centre, said weight-loss jabs “provide genuinely fantastic weight loss, and may provide an intervention that could be delivered on a population-scale, where we have not been able to achieve this before”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 22:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxPSjMtbGhVazM4NUZqOURXbTlGVzRSWk02ODhBcnVqVDVzMW9sU2VDaTVDVUlaQkRVaG5aZGRGYk5Hc1RRNzJ5U0FBeGNpNWpnRU1YNjJycUtvdnI1SDBodWRwSzByUG1PSTA3RDljeVN6RExEd19CMVlLQ0R2dUt3TE9YUzZ1d0JMYXYwa1Q2b0RueklnY0ljbUszRzhDQlYyYlA1UTBQY2RvSktHeFBpb19tZFV2eGptSGxnTQ</guid></item><item><title>卡斯县报告了两例麻疹病例，使北达科他州的麻疹病例总数达到11例- Valley News Live | Two cases of measles reported in Cass County bringing total to 11 in North Dakota - Valley News Live</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;CASS COUNTY, N.D.

Exposed individuals who were vaccinated don’t need to quarantine but should still monitor for symptoms for 21 days after exposure. Individuals who have not received a dose of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine should quarantine (stay home) and monitor for symptoms for 21 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“The MMR vaccine is 93% effective after one dose and 97% effective after two doses,” said Molly Howell, HHS immunization director. “People who are vaccinated and exposed to measles are not likely to develop the disease. MMR vaccination is critical to preventing the spread of measles in the community. Anyone who is eligible and has not yet been vaccinated is encouraged to contact a trusted health care provider about MMR vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="copyright |"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Copyright 2025 KVLY.

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study tracked the BMI of thousands of children in the Netherlands at age two, six, 10, 14 and 18, and found that every one-unit increase in BMI at age six more than doubled a child’s odds of being overweight or obese at 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The research, presented at the European Congress on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/obesity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; in Málaga, also found overweight children who reached a healthier weight before they turned six were no longer at higher risk of being overweight or obese in their late teens. But if they lost weight after that age, they still had an elevated chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Of the 3,528 young people, 32.3% were considered overweight or obese at age two, with 22.3% at age six, 24.7% at age 10 and 20.6% at age 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Many of these children were still classed as overweight or obese at 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Jasmin de Groot, of Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, said: “We need to understand how children grow and develop if we are to help future generations grow up healthier and give every child a chance at a happy, healthy life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She added: “The first five years of a child’s life provide a fantastic opportunity to intervene and prevent them experiencing overweight and obesity in the years to come.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-8" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"morning-briefing","successDescription":"Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My heart sinks to my stomach just thinking about the panic and confusion at having to defend ourselves for something we didn’t do.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exam was multiple choice and according to authorities the sisters’ answers were so similar they could only have been achieved by cheating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The girls, who were 24 at the time, were summoned to appear first before the Dean and then, one week later, before the university’s honors council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The panel told them that a professor had raised questions of them cheating during the exam while remotely monitoring the answers of the whole class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kellie (left) and Kayla Bingham on their graduation day from Furman University in South Carolina where they both majored and minored in medical sciences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kellie (left) and Kayla Bingham at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) before they were accused of cheating in a vital exam and their future as doctors began to unravel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He asked a proctor to ‘keep an extra eye’ on the girls as the testing went on. She reported that she’d seen them nodding their heads as if exchanging signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said one had pushed back her chair and the other had ‘flipped’ a piece of paper on the table for her sister to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today Kayla remains as passionate in her denials as she was then. She says: ‘There was absolutely no signaling. We never looked at each other and there was no secret language or kind of twin telepathy.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kayla says people have frequently commented on their similar body language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile Kellie insists that the twins are so bonded by nature and nurture that their grades have been almost as identical as they are throughout their schooling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They’d graded within a fraction of each other in high school and their SAT scores had been the exact same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two had regularly achieved the same results when they’d taken exams on different days and in separate locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But their arguments fell on deaf ears and the council found them guilty of cheating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It was as ridiculous as it was devastating,’ Kayla says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They appealed to the dean. And, after what Kellie describes as the ‘most excruciating week of our lives that felt like an eternity,’ he cleared them of all charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the damage was done. Word of the twins’ ‘cheating’ had already leaked. Few on the campus paid any attention to the fact that the university had found them innocent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the vast majority of their peers in Charleston, it was a case of no smoke without fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kayla pales as she recalls how college Facebook groups shredded their reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We couldn’t bear to look at the vile comments ourselves,’ she says. ‘But we heard about them from Kellie’s boyfriend and our cousin, another student at MUSC, who had access to the groups.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vicious rumors circulated across the university. Their peers were judge, jury and hangman, calling for them to be expelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In reality, if the twins had been found guilty, they would have had to repeat their second year of med school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Not that it mattered because, despite us being innocent, our “punishment” was much worse,’ Kayla says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kayla (left) and Kellie Bingham. They often used to dress alike and have the same passion for dogs.  Kayla says people have frequently commented on their similar body language&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kayla (left) and Kellie Bingham were always together growing up and excelled in sports such as soccer. They attended the same grade schools before going to the same college and medical school in South Carolina&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gossip gathered pace and reached community blogs in Charleston. Next, a city newspaper highlighted the case, giving identifying details of the twins in a sensational, front-page article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They didn’t name us, but might as well have done,’ Kellie says of what became a series of stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That summer, the twins spent an emotionally tumultuous three months at home with their parents in Columbia and prayed that things would die down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The girls had wanted to become doctors since the age of 12, whether it was working directly with patients or undertaking medical research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our hearts and passions were in medicine,’ Kayla says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They had enjoyed their first two years as students, despite the increasingly heavy workload, and made good friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But that all fell away in the heat of the scandal that blew up on campus. Both suffered panic attacks — Kayla developed facial and verbal ticks which she still has to this day — and gained and lost substantial amounts of weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, they returned to UMSC in late August 2016. They had no choice, Kellie explains, ‘Our first love was medicine, and we couldn’t just walk away.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the twins were naïve if they thought the prejudice would dissipate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They say they walked into student hangouts in Charleston and the place would go silent. People nudged each other and pointed with hostility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It got so bad that the pair had to order delivery rather than eat at restaurants. They were disinvited from two weddings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One bride dispatched a generic-sounding email, saying there had been some kind of mistake. The other simply didn’t follow up after sending a save-the-date card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We’d been known as two of the most social people on campus, but now we were treated like pariahs,’ Kellie says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC.) The institution accused the twins of cheating and its board of honors initially found them guilty. The dean overturned the judgement and declared them innocent. But the damage to the women's reputations was done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kayla and Kellie Bingham. The sisters had wanted to become doctors since the age of 12, whether it was working directly with patients or undertaking medical research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The incident that horrified Kayla the most occurred when a male student deliberately barged into her as she walked along a corridor at school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘He literally pushed me into a wall, and I had to go into a maintenance closet because I was so scared,’ she says. ‘I called my parents from the closet, saying, “I can't deal with this anymore.”’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The twins withdrew from UMSC in mid-September. Kayla says: ‘It was at the recommendation of the dean who said it was “better for our safety” to remove ourselves.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Life would never be the same. The twins were consoled by their tight-knit family but cried in each other’s arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Kayla was the one person who’d been through what I had,’ Kellie says. ‘Only she could understand how dreadful it was.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In early 2017, the pair filed a lawsuit against UMSC and sued them for slander and defamation. They accused the institution of allowing the cheating allegations to leak and doing nothing to defend the students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We knew the truth and it was a matter of principle,’ Kellie says of their determination to clear their names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It took five years for the suit to come to court in Charleston in November 2022, partly due to delays caused by Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the interim, the twins abandoned all ambitions to become doctors. Instead, they pivoted to law enrolling in the University of South Carolina’s law school as they became increasingly involved in the machinations of their own case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They gave evidence about the day of the fateful exam and the distressing aftermath describing the trauma that, they maintain, still affects them to this day and changed the course of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile the sisters’ lawyer presented their education records to the court. They showed how they’d received identical or near-identical scores in exams over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A professor from their high school sent a letter saying that they’d submitted the exact same answers — some correct, some not — for an exam he’d supervised a decade earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They’d been sitting at opposite ends of the classroom, and it would have been impossible for them to collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Psychologist&lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://drnancysegaltwins.org/"&gt; Nancy Segal&lt;/a&gt;, who specializes in behavioral genetics and the study of twins, was called as an expert witness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told the jury about the ‘very close intertwining’ of twins and said cheating complaints are common in academia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kayla (left) and Kellie Bingham. ‘We knew the truth and it was a matter of principle,’ Kellie says of their determination to clear their names. They were shocked at the prejudice against them, despite being found innocent of cheating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Segal, the director of the Twins Studies Center at California State University, Fullerton says that in testifying, she was helping ‘put a terrible wrong right.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘For a medical establishment, UMSC showed an astonishing lack of familiarity and knowledge when it comes to twins,’ she says, noting how they’re raised in the same environment and are ‘natural partners in life.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Studies have found that identical twins have very similar interests, abilities, achievements and test-taking skills because they are genetically predisposed to perform and behave the same way,’ Segal adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The jury took less than two hours to decide in the Binghams’ favor, awarding them $1.5 million in compensation. The sum, Kayla says, was mostly absorbed by legal fees and taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But it was never about the money,’ says Kayla, who held hands with Kellie as the verdict was delivered. ‘What price tag can you put on your reputation and name?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today the twins work for a major law firm, specializing in relations between companies and state and federal government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We miss medicine tremendously and it’s been tough for us,’ Kayla, who, in common with Kellie had been considering anesthesiology, says. ‘But our work is very rewarding, and we feel as if we’re where we belong.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MUSC appealed within the mandatory 30 days challenging the decision on procedural grounds. ‘It’s still hanging over us,’ Kellie says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the twins are fiercely proud of their victory in this battle of David and Goliath. Kayla says, ‘It was an agonizing process, but we refused to bow down.” We can always hold our heads up high.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Medical University of South Carolina told the Daily Mail it would not comment on the Bingham case because it involved 'pending litigation'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Or wondered if you need to get this probably minor thing checked out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our modern lives of overworking, poor sleep routines and general life stress all exacerbate a wide variety of &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/symptoms" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. However, there are some things that, though seemingly small, may require a second opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt; spoke to Dr Lori Solomon, chair of the Department of Family and Community Medicine at New York Medical College, and Dr Estelle Williams, ​​medical director for CityMD for the southern New Jersey region to get their thoughts on which symptoms should really not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going to the bathroom too frequently&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waking up in the middle of the night needing to pee is totally normal, Solomon tells &lt;em&gt;The Independent.&lt;/em&gt; But if that’s something you’re doing two or three times per night – every night – that might be indicative of a more serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over-frequent urination can be a &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/symptom" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:symptom;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;symptom&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/diabetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. “When your sugar is high, one of the ways the body tries to get rid of the sugar, is to get rid of it through the urine,” Soloman says. “During the day, you just go to the bathroom more often, but at nighttime, you often have to wake up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Simple things such as needing to go to the bathroom frequently at night, or pain that causes you to wake up, may be a sign of something more serious that should be checked out by a medical professional (Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams agrees, adding that other worrying signs can be feeling more thirsty and a significant increase in appetite. “Those are the types of things I think need to be checked sooner rather than later,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain in the night&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any pain that wakes you up during the night could be a problem. While pulled muscles, physical injuries, or other discomforts may hinder someone getting to sleep – they shouldn’t be disturbing you once you’re asleep, Solomon says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you're waking up in the middle of the night with a headache, you've got a problem… because usually we don't wake up with headaches in the middle of the night,” she says. “If that's waking you up at night – I'm a little bit more worried about that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sudden headaches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headaches are “super common,” and shouldn’t necessarily be considered worrisome, Solomon says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if a headache is accompanied by other things such as vision changes, nausea tingling in the extremities, weakness – those may be a sign that something neurological is going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams cautions those who jump to label sudden, severe headaches as &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/migraines" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:migraines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;migraines&lt;/a&gt;. “A migraine is actually a very specific &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/diagnosis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diagnosis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; and headache pattern, requiring neurologic evaluation,” she says. “It's good that you get evaluated if you're having a headache that's unusual for you, if it’s very intense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Headaches are super common, but if you’re experiencing extra symptoms including nausea, vision changes or weakness this can be a sign of something else. Sudden, intense headaches, known as ‘thunderclap headaches’ should definitely necessitate a trip to the emergency room (Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such high-intensity episodes, coming on quickly and out of nowhere, can be what is known as “thunderclap headaches” should definitely necessitate a trip to the &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/emergency-room" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:emergency room;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;emergency room&lt;/a&gt;, says Solomon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shortness of breath or fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another symptom that crops up fairly frequently that shouldn’t be ignored is sudden shortness of breath – especially if it’s not something you’ve experienced before, says Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you're like, ‘that's weird. I was just doing my regular activities and I became very winded and short of breath,’ get that checked,” she says. “I would also say, if you take a deep breath and you develop pain in your chest or your back that you've never had before, that can sometimes be a soft sign for a &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/blood-clot" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood clot;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood clot&lt;/a&gt; in the lungs, called a pulmonary embolism, that we certainly want to see for sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/fatigue" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fatigue;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; too – while common in many people due to hectic work schedules or other lifestyle commitments – should not be significantly interfering with things you would do day-to-day such as exercising, Solomon adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In very severe cases, fatigue can be symptomatic of &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/heart-disease" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, sleep apnea, and even some cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indigestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one less obvious and very typical symptom of heart disease. “It's very common for people who are having a &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/heart-attack" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart attack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; to think they're having indigestion,” Solomon says. “If you’re taking a walk and all of a sudden you feel like, ‘Oh, I’ve got some indigestion’, and then it gets better when you stop walking, that's your heart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination of fatigue and indigestion, unconnected to a big meal, is something that people should see the doctor about, she says. It could be due to a lack of blood flow to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams says that bouts of indigestion-like symptoms – pressure or tightness – that last for 15 minutes or 20 minutes can be telling, especially for those who do not typically suffer from indigestion or heartburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes people think ‘Oh, I just ate something weird, and I must have a bubble of gas in my chest,” she says. “That sensation of indigestion is something that can be an indicator of heart disease… It can be a masker of something more serious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood in your stool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitor your bowels, says Williams, because being constipated or having diarrhea is something that's different is worth getting checked out. And while it may seem obvious, seeing blood in either your poop or pee is definitely something to see a doctor about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re having a change of bowel habits – if you see black stool or a lot of blood when you’re using the restroom, I feel like that's perhaps not a subtle sign,” William says. “That's something a little more concerning that means you should come in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often associate blood in the stool as a hemorrhoid, but should not be ignored as it can be a common presentation for &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/colon-cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:colon cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;, according to Solomon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In general you generally don't want to see blood in the urine either,” she says. “But that's usually &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/kidney-stones" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:kidney stones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;kidney stones&lt;/a&gt; or urinary tract infections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistent symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon also warns people to pay attention when things just don’t clear up on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there's a cough lasting more than four weeks, you generally want to see somebody about that,” Solomon says. “There's lots of reasons you can have a cough, but generally, if you have a cough after a cold, it generally goes away in a few weeks. So if it lasts longer than a month, we generally want to know about that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams agrees, adding that things that have been happening for months that may seem innocuous may still be worth investigating. Losing weight unintentionally is definitely something worth mentioning to your primary care doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;There are many reasons that a person can get a cough, though most generally go away in a week or so following a cold. Any longer, and it might be worth booking an appointment to see your doctor (Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all, Solomon recommends that to avoid anything too concerning, take regular visits to your primary care physician, who is better qualified to notice any changes, concerning or otherwise. She encourages people to be over, rather than under-cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes people feel silly about coming in with all these different symptoms, but I don’t think we could expect that people are going to know everything that doctors know,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'd rather say it’s nothing and reassure them than miss something that could be really serious if we didn't catch it in time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 20:48:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study involved 240 seven- to 15-year-olds, from schools in Merseyside. On two separate occasions, they were shown or played five minutes of junk food adverts and then non-food adverts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Subsequently, they were offered snacks such as grapes or chocolate buttons, and later, lunch with a range of savoury, sweet and healthy items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The authors calculated that, after the adverts, the children consumed 58 calories more in snacks and ate 73 more calories for lunch than after exposure to non-food ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The research, to be presented at the European Congress on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/obesity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; in Málaga, Spain, also found that the impact on calorie intake was the same whether the adverts were for specific foods or were generic adverts for fast food brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;And it was unaffected by the type of advert, such as video with sound, social media posts, podcast adverts, and posters or billboards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Emma Boyland, the lead author of the study and professor of food marketing and child health at the University of Liverpool, said: “This is the first study to show that brand-only food advertising affects what children eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We also showed that children don’t just eat more immediately following food advertising, they actually ate more at the lunch meal as well, a couple of hours after they had seen the advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The foods that we served them weren’t the same foods that were shown in the advertisements and were presented with no branding information. So it wasn’t that they were driven to buy the particular food or go and consume fast food, it was just a prompt to consume what was available.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Experts warned that the findings revealed a loophole in the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/12/junk-food-tv-ads-to-be-banned-pre-watershed-in-uk-from-october-2025#:~:text=Junk%20food%20TV%20advertisements%20are,told%20the%20Commons%20on%20Thursday." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;government’s proposed ban on junk food TV adverts before 9pm&lt;/a&gt;, due to come into effect in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Katharine Jenner, the director of the Obesity &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Alliance, said the study must send “a clear message to policymakers: food advertising is driving excess calorie intake in children”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She added: “From October, new restrictions will limit unhealthy food adverts on TV before 9pm and online at any time – a vital step forward that will protect children from the worst offenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“But loopholes remain. Brands will still be able to advertise to young people even without showing specific products, on billboards and at bus stops, and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/24/child-obesity-in-england-still-above-pre-pandemic-levels-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;children living with overweight or obesity&lt;/a&gt; are especially vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“If the government is serious about ending junk food advertising to children, they must close the loopholes that will allow companies to keep bombarding them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="08eae0d7-c192-421c-bc03-d35898309395" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":15,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Schools in Spain required to serve fruit, vegetables and fish in fight against obesity","elementId":"08eae0d7-c192-421c-bc03-d35898309395","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/16/schools-in-spain-required-to-serve-fruit-vegetables-and-fish-in-fight-against-obesity"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Helen Stewart, the officer for health improvement at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: “Childhood obesity is stubbornly high, with children in the most deprived areas facing rates more than twice as high as their peers.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db443.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Control&lt;/a&gt; estimates only 20% of Americans strength train a few times a week. Some people think you have to spend countless hours pumping iron in pools of sweat to see results. Those of us with busy schedules are focused on getting the most out of the time we spend working out and maximizing our results with the time we have. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this hot-off-the-press study, researchers explored how many hours of &lt;a href="https://www.themanual.com/fitness/best-strength-training-exercises/" rel&gt;weekly strength training&lt;/a&gt; boost muscle strength. Here’s the research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a brand new &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/abstract/9900/without_fail__muscular_adaptations_in_single_set.782.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports &amp;amp; Exercise&lt;/em&gt;, 42 healthy resistance-trained adults completed a single set of nine common upper- and lower-body &lt;a href="https://www.themanual.com/fitness/beginning-weightlifting/" rel&gt;resistance training exercises&lt;/a&gt; targeting all major muscle groups in each session. Participants lifted twice weekly for eight weeks and were split into two groups:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list" data-block-type="core"&gt;
&lt;li data-block-type="core"&gt;The FAIL group trained to failure on all exercises.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li data-block-type="core"&gt;The 2-RIR group trained with two repetitions in reserve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The workout session was designed to be on the shorter side because people often say that their busy schedules are the reason why they don’t do strength training. The researchers set out to uncover the minimum effective dose where you can still get results in muscle power without spending all of those hours at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the beginning and the end of the study, researchers assessed muscle thickness for &lt;a href="https://www.themanual.com/fitness/best-biceps-workouts/" rel&gt;the biceps brachii&lt;/a&gt; and triceps brachii arm muscles as well as &lt;a href="https://www.themanual.com/fitness/best-quad-workouts/" rel&gt;the quadriceps femoris&lt;/a&gt;, which are the muscles at the front of your thighs. Researchers also measured muscular strength and power endurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results showed that both groups had noticeable gains, with muscle growth being a little more prominent in the FAIL group. There were similar increases in strength and local muscular endurance in both groups. During those two months, the 42 adults gained significant muscle mass and strength even with just two 30-minute sessions a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is a small study, it shows that single-set routines can certainly be a time-efficient way to promote muscular growth and power, even when transitioning from higher-volume programs. Strength training in shorter durations provides health benefits, builds muscle, and fits into your busy schedule. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even just one hour a week can yield results, so it’s worth making room in your schedule to prioritize your fitness and wellness and lift those weights. Another &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/56/13/755" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; showed that those who did just 30 to 60 minutes of weekly strength training had a 10 to 20% lower risk of complications and fatality from conditions like cancer and heart disease, compared to those who didn’t do any resistance training. I think I might squeeze in a resistance training session later today.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Not only must your brain maintain a vast archive of existing memories, but it also has to keep track of new stuff each day. That requires getting ready to deal with new memories before they occur, even while processing old ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's well-known that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sleep-almost-doubles-our-chances-of-remembering-forgotten-things-study-finds"&gt;sleep is important for memory&lt;/a&gt; and learning, among other things, but we're still figuring out many of the precise mechanisms involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, it's seen as a backwards-facing process: We experience something, the memory of it is then processed and preserved during subsequent nights of sleep, and we can recall it at will later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a new study, however, sleep seems to help us process not just past memories, but also future ones. In addition to consolidating and conserving memories while we sleep, the study suggests our brains are also actively preparing us to record upcoming events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory is a broad, multifaceted phenomenon that helps make us who we are, and from our subjective perspective it can seem almost magical, somehow beyond discrete components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not, though. At a cellular level, groups of specialized neurons known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engram_(neuropsychology)"&gt;engram cells&lt;/a&gt; physically encode our life experiences in a format we can recall later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has made it clear &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-more-about-how-the-brain-strengthens-memories-during-sleep"&gt;sleep is crucial&lt;/a&gt; for this process to work properly, but many physiological details remain unclear. On top of merely storing memories, our brains also perform incredible feats of processing and organization, much of which occurs during mental downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new study, researchers in Japan sought to learn more about the role sleep plays in memory processing, including the preparation for memorable experiences that haven't happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ir0pT8grfI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors used an imaging system for freely moving mice that can reveal both engram and non-engram cells across the stages of memory processing. They were able to track neuronal activity before, during, and after memorable events the mice experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shed new light on the behavior of specific neuron populations under various cognitive conditions, including while mice slept both before and after learning experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results highlighted two parallel processes unfolding in post-learning slumber. First, engram cells that initially encoded a memory showed predictable reactivation patterns, part of the brain's well-documented procedure for consolidating memories during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed another interesting population of neurons, which weren't yet associated with specific memories. These "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58860-w"&gt;engram-to-be cells&lt;/a&gt;," as the researchers call them, grew increasingly synchronized as mice slept after learning. Later, the same neuron groups went on to encode new, different memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Engram-to-be cells exhibited increased coactivity with existing engram cells during sleep, suggesting that this interaction helps shape new memory networks," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1081734"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; co-author Kaoru Inokuchi, a professor of biochemistry at the University of Toyama in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also developed a neural network model to simulate activity in the hippocampus, hoping to further illuminate the underlying mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model pointed to synaptic &lt;span&gt;depression&lt;/span&gt; and scaling, phenomena known to modify neuronal connections during sleep, as likely important for organizing these engram-to-be cells – a service that dwindled in the model when those mechanisms were disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engram and engram-to-be cells showed intriguing co-activation in post-learning sleep, the study found, hinting at some coordination or even data transfer between the neural networks for past and upcoming memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests sleep quality between learning events may influence not only our retention of what we've learned so far, but also how well we'll retain new information in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While more research is needed, this could be valuable insight for education and treatment of memory disorders, and it could help uncover novel ways to help people maximize their cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We believe that manipulating brain activity during sleep or sleep patterns may uncover methods to enhance memory by unlocking the brain's latent potential," Inokuchi &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1081734"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, however, these findings add to the mountain of existing evidence that we should all take sleep seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We want people to understand that sleep is not just about rest – it plays a crucial role in how the brain processes information," Inokuchi &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1081734"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "With that in mind, we hope everyone will begin to value sleep more and use it as a way to improve their overall quality of life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58860-w"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1785 English philosopher Jeremy Bentham designed the perfect prison: Cells circle a tower from which an unseen guard can observe any inmate at will. As far as a prisoner knows, at any given time, the guard may be watching — or may not be. Inmates have to assume they're constantly observed and behave accordingly.

"It's one of the first topics to have been studied in psychology," says Clément Belletier, a psychologist at University of Clermont Auvergne in France. In 1898 psychologist Norman Triplett showed that cyclists raced harder in the presence of others. From the 1970s onward, studies showed how we change our overt behavior when we are watched to manage our reputation and social consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But being watched doesn't just change our behavior; decades of research show it also infiltrates our mind to impact how we &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt;. And now a new study reveals how being watched affects unconscious processing in our brain. In this era of surveillance, researchers say, the findings raise concerns about our collective mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/id-never-seen-such-an-audacious-attack-on-anonymity-before-clearview-ai-and-the-creepy-tech-that-can-identify-you-with-a-single-picture" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/id-never-seen-such-an-audacious-attack-on-anonymity-before-clearview-ai-and-the-creepy-tech-that-can-identify-you-with-a-single-picture"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'I'd never seen such an audacious attack on anonymity before': Clearview AI and the creepy tech that can identify you with a single picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="watchful-eyes-3"&gt;Watchful eyes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being looked at grabs our attention, as demonstrated by the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17278526/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17278526/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stare-in-a-crowd effect&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: amid a sea of faces that aren't looking at us, we immediately detect a single one that is. This is because gaze direction, especially eye contact, is a powerful social signal that helps us to perceive others' intentions and predict their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as babies, a direct gaze quickly draws our attention. "These tendencies emerge very early" and are present across the animal kingdom, says Clara Colombatto, who studies social cognition at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. This ability likely evolved to detect predators, which may explain why being watched can &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-08020-009" target="_blank" data-url="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-08020-009" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;provoke psychological discomfort&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19823960/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19823960/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;physical fight-or-flight responses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, such as sweating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-PibFQd4HR3TaeK4nLvF5N" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-PibFQd4HR3TaeK4nLvF5N slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a conscious level, we behave differently when we are watched. We become more prosocial, meaning we're &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S109051381200089X" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S109051381200089X" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more likely to give&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and less likely to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26644979/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26644979/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cheat or litter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Some studies have even suggested that theft or littering could be reduced merely by &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082055" target="_blank" data-url="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082055" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;posting pictures of eyes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This kind of thinking led to the idea that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-illusion-of-being-observed-can-make-you-better-person/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-illusion-of-being-observed-can-make-you-better-person/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;surveillance could be used for social good&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — to prevent crime, for instance — echoing Bentham's methods for controlling incarcerated people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that people behave differently under watchful eyes isn't surprising. Who among us hasn't acted more selfishly when they were alone than they would when someone could see them? Psychologists put this down to concern with one's reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But over the past few decades, researchers have found that being watched also affects &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721419829699" target="_blank" data-url="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721419829699" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cognitive functions such as memory and attention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For one thing, it can be very distracting. One study found that participants &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27357954/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27357954/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;performed worse on a working memory&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; task when they were presented with pictures of people looking at them compared with when they were shown pictures of people with averted eyes. The researchers concluded that a direct gaze grabs participants' attention and diverts their attentional resources from a given task. Other studies have found that more functions, ranging from our &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00671/full" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00671/full" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;spatial cognition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027716302360" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027716302360" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;language processing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; abilities, are similarly taxed by a watchful stare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="unconscious-effects-3"&gt;Unconscious effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of surveillance on cognition go even deeper — into our brain's unconscious processing of the world around us. In a study published last December, researchers showed that being watched accelerated participants' unconscious analysis of faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team led by neuroscientist Kiley Seymour of the University of Technology Sydney used a technique called continuous flash suppression, or CFS, to measure how quickly people detected visual stimuli that initially escaped their conscious awareness. This technique involves presenting moving, colored patterns to one eye, which can delay awareness of images presented to the other eye. Previous studies showed that people would become aware of a suppressed image more quickly if it was more salient. For example, one CFS study found that participants became aware of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027711000345" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027711000345" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;faces looking at them&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; faster than faces with averted eyes, showing that our brain processes gaze direction before we even know that we've seen anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seymour and her colleagues wondered whether this unconscious processing might also be affected by knowing one is being watched. They had a group of people witness cameras being set up to send a live feed of them to another room. The participants were then shown faces that were suppressed by CFS, and they were asked to press buttons to indicate each face's location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in the "watched" group &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2024/1/niae039/7920510" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2024/1/niae039/7920510" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;perceived faces faster and more accurately&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than those in the control group, who performed the same task without the overt surveillance. The difference was nearly a second. "That's big for these types of unconscious processes," says Colombatto, who was not involved in this study. Although the surveilled participants reported that they felt that they were being watched, they did not think this affected their performance. The effect was specific to faces — it did not occur for neutral stimuli such as abstract patterns — meaning being watched didn't just increase arousal or effort across the board. The fact that this unconscious process is influenced by inferring an observer's presence "shows just how sophisticated social perception is," Colombatto says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, researchers assumed the effects of being watched come from seeing people's eyes, but Colombatto and her colleagues found that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30324506/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30324506/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pictures of mouths that were directed toward participants&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; negatively impacted working memory. The team has also shown that mouths that are presented using CFS &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027721003243" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027721003243" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;enter conscious awareness faster&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if they're directed toward participants rather than away from them. This even works with abstract geometric shapes that can point toward or away from a person, such as cones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These effects aren't really just about eyes. They're more general effects of people's minds and attention being directed toward you.... We call these effects of 'mind contact,'" Colombatto says. "It's really about being the object of someone's attention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="unseen-consequences-3"&gt;Unseen consequences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveillance, then, seems to shift our social processing into high gear. "The conclusion would be that being watched drives this hardwired survival mechanism into overdrive," Seymour says. "You're in fight-or-flight mode, which is taxing on the brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How might today's ubiquitous electronic eyes affect our mental health? The toll could be worse for people with schizophrenia, who, Seymour's research suggests, may be &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27207190/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27207190/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hypersensitive to others' gaze&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Other conditions, such as social anxiety, also feature hypersensitivity to social cues, and that results in feelings of distress. "I'd say the modern world's constant surveillance is shifting us all in that direction, to some degree," Seymour says, "meaning we're all more attuned to our social environment and on edge, ready to react."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Panopticon, inmates always know a guard could be watching but never if one truly is. This is the key to the prison's power, argued French philosopher Michel Foucault: it becomes omniscient and internalized by the prisoners themselves. This may be why Bentham's prison feels so relevant in our digital age of algorithms, data brokers and social media, when we frequently feel watched — but we don't know who is watching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This constant surveillance could tax cognition in ways that we don't yet understand. The faculties compromised by surveillance "are those that allow us to focus on what we're doing: attention, working memory, and so on," Belletier says. "If these processes are taxed by being monitored, you'd expect deteriorating capacity to concentrate." This body of research suggests that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.enhancesystems.net/tech-insight-uk-employers-ramp-up-workplace-surveillance/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.enhancesystems.net/tech-insight-uk-employers-ramp-up-workplace-surveillance/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bringing more surveillance into workplaces&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — usually an attempt to boost productivity — could actually be counterproductive. It also suggests that online testing environments, where students are watched through webcams by human proctors or AI, could lead to lower performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We didn't have as much surveillance and social connections 50 years ago, so it's a new societal context we're adapting to," Colombatto says. "It's important to think about how this is going to change our cognition, even in unconscious ways."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was first published at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-being-watched-changes-how-you-think/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-being-watched-changes-how-you-think/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. © &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/scientificamerican.com/__;!!NLFGqXoFfo8MMQ!ve-vRNHfxzMpuwnzghmp615VHAOThOfKc0RxPLCh1dx85wIiwQoA7iednip0GtnAIg1pK3FBwkmX_WffcAvtUO0%24" target="_blank" data-url="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/scientificamerican.com/__;!!NLFGqXoFfo8MMQ!ve-vRNHfxzMpuwnzghmp615VHAOThOfKc0RxPLCh1dx85wIiwQoA7iednip0GtnAIg1pK3FBwkmX_WffcAvtUO0%24" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;ScientificAmerican.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Weight loss jabs could help slash alcohol intake in obese people by around two thirds, according to a study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;It is thought the drugs help curb cravings for alcohol, experts said, although more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;Weight loss jabs, also known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, work by reducing food cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;The study, led by academics in Ireland and Saudi Arabia, included 262 obese people who had been prescribed liraglutide or semaglutide, which are available under the brand names Saxenda and Wegovy respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;They were categorised based on the amount of alcohol they consumed each week prior to starting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="openweb-container" data-openweb-ad data-row="1" data-column="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/news/health/having-children-later-and-being-overweight-increases-risk-of-breast-cancer/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having children later and being overweight ‘increases risk of breast cancer’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/news/health/junk-food-advertising-children-healthy-eating-uk-health/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just five minutes of exposure to junk food advertising per day makes children eat more calories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;The groups included non-drinkers, rare drinkers who had less than 10 units a week, and regular drinkers, who reported having 10 or more units each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;Some 188 of the 262 patients were followed up for an average of four months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;Average alcohol consumption fell from 11.3 units a week - about six or seven pints of beer - to 4.3 units a week, or roughly two pints of beer, after four months on the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;Among regular drinkers, intake decreased by 68%, from 23.2 units a week to 7.8 units a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;Professor Carel le Roux, of University College Dublin, said: "The exact mechanism of how GLP-1 analogues reduce alcohol intake is still being investigated but it is thought to involve curbing cravings for alcohol that arise in subcortical areas of the brain that are not under conscious control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;"Thus, patients report the effects are 'effortless'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;The findings, which are being presented at the European Congress on Obesity in Malaga, suggest a "potential therapeutic role" for weight loss jabs in people who are obese and regularly drink alcohol, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;However, they stressed larger trials are needed to validate the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;Prof Le Roux added: "GLP-1 analogues have been shown treat obesity and reduce the risk of multiple obesity-related complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;"Now, the beneficial effects beyond obesity, such as on alcohol intake, are being actively studied, with some promising results."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of kilometers of rivers around the world are carrying antibiotic pollution at levels high enough to promote drug resistance and harm aquatic life, a McGill University-led study warns.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																					&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;i&gt;PNAS Nexus&lt;/i&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf096/8113371" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; is the first to estimate the scale of global river contamination from human antibiotics use. Researchers calculated that about 8,500 tons of antibiotics—nearly one-third of what people consume annually—end up in river systems around the world each year even after, in many cases, passing through wastewater systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While the amounts of residues from individual antibiotics translate into only very small concentrations in most rivers, which makes them very difficult to detect, the chronic and cumulative environmental exposure to these substances can still pose a risk to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/human+health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human health&lt;/a&gt; and aquatic ecosystems," said Heloisa Ehalt Macedo, a postdoctoral fellow in geography at McGill and lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team used a global model validated by field data from nearly 900 river locations. They found that amoxicillin, the world's most-used antibiotic, is the most likely to be present at risky levels, especially in Southeast Asia, where rising use and limited &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/wastewater+treatment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;wastewater treatment&lt;/a&gt; amplify the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study is not intended to warn about the use of antibiotics—we need antibiotics for global health treatments—but our results indicate that there may be unintended effects on aquatic environments and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/antibiotic+resistance/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which calls for mitigation and management strategies to avoid or reduce their implications," said Bernhard Lehner, a professor in global hydrology in McGill's Department of Geography and co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are especially notable because the study did not consider antibiotics from livestock or pharmaceutical factories, both of which are major contributors to environmental contamination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results show that antibiotic pollution in rivers arising from &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/human+consumption/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human consumption&lt;/a&gt; alone is a critical issue, which would likely be exacerbated by veterinary or industry sources of related compounds," said Jim Nicell, an environmental engineering professor at McGill and co-author of the study. "Monitoring programs to detect antibiotic or other chemical contamination of waterways are therefore needed, especially in areas that our model predicts to be at risk."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three months of time-restricted eating (TRE), irrespective of whether it is earlier or later in the day, may be a promising strategy for sustaining long-term weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity, according to preliminary results of a randomised controlled trial being presented at this year's European Congress on Obesity (ECO) in Malaga, Spain (11-14 May).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study found that restricting the eating window to 8 hours at any time of the day for 3 months can result in significant weight loss for at least a year. These benefits can be attributed to the 16-hour fasting window rather than the time of eating."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Alba Camacho-Cardenosa&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;Instituto de Investigación Biosanitaria de Granada (ibs.GRANADA), Granada, Spain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low-calorie diets are well-known ways to lose weight and improve cardiometabolic health. However, long-term adherence is typically low, even among highly motivated people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRE, which limits when, but not what people eat, is an increasingly popular intermittent fasting approach that may have greater long-term adherence and lead to better weight maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A previous randomised controlled trial by the same research team published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; found that reducing the eating window from 12 hours or more to 8 hours per day decreases body weight and improves cardiometabolic health [1]. However, the impact of eating window timing on the long-term maintenance of benefits remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out more, researchers conducted a 12-month follow-up of the randomised controlled trial [1] in 99 adults with overweight or obesity (50% women; average age 49 years; average BMI: 32 kg/m²) from Granada (Spain) to investigate whether the weight loss achieved after 3 months of TRE is sustained for 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups for 12 weeks: habitual eating window of 12 hours or more; early TRE (8-hour eating window starting before 10:00); late TRE (8-hour eating window starting after 13:00); self-selected TRE (allowing participants to choose their own 8-hour eating window, which might improve adherence, acceptability, and &lt;a href="/health/What-Does-Efficacy-Mean.aspx" class="linked-term"&gt;efficacy&lt;/a&gt;). All groups also took part in a Mediterranean diet education programme to encourage them to eat healthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-middle-mrec-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-mrec"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers measured body weight, waist and hip circumferences at the start of the trial, after the 12-week intervention, and 12 months after the intervention had ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="trendmd-conditional-suggestions" class="related-content-embed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the 12-week intervention, the habitual eating group experienced an average weight loss of&lt;br&gt;
−1.4 kg (−1.5%). All TRE groups achieved significantly greater weight loss than the habitual eating group, with an average weight loss of −4.2 kg (−4.5%) in the early TRE group, −3.1 kg (−3.5%) in the late TRE group, and −3.8 kg (−3.9%) in the self-selected TRE group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the habitual eating group had a lower waist circumference (−1.1 cm) and hip circumference (−1.4 cm) after 12 weeks of intervention. In comparison, the early TRE group experienced significantly greater reductions in waist and hip circumferences (average −4.1 cm and −4.6 cm, respectively). The late TRE group also achieved a significant reduction in waist circumference (average −4.1 cm), but there was no significant reduction in hip circumference (average −3.2 cm). Although not statistically significant, the self-selected TRE group also achieved reductions in waist and hip circumferences (average −3.7 cm and −3.6 cm respectively)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;All TRE groups maintained greater weight loss than habitual eating at 12 months&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twelve months after the intervention ended, preliminary results reveal that the habitual eating group had an average body weight increase of 0.4 kg (+0.5%).&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Both the early TRE and the late TRE groups maintained significantly greater weight loss compared to the habitual eating group (average −2.1% [−2.2 kg] and −2.0% [−2.0 kg] respectively). Although not statistically significant, the self-selected TRE group also maintained greater body weight loss than the habitual eating group (average −0.7% [−0.7 kg]).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the habitual eating group showed an increase in waist circumference of +1.8 cm at 12 months, and a slight increase of +0.03 cm in hip circumference. In comparison, both waist and hip circumferences remained significantly lower in the late TRE group (average −5.6 cm and −3.4 cm respectively) compared with habitual eating group. Although not statistically significant, the early TRE group and self-selected TRE group also showed lower values in waist (average −0.5 cm and −1.3 cm respectively) and hip circumferences (average −1.0 cm and −1.8 cm respectively).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, there were no significant differences between the TRE groups in any measurement, indicating that the simple 3-month lifestyle intervention may be an effective long-term approach for sustaining weight loss, irrespective of the timing of the eating window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No serious adverse events were reported during the 12-week intervention, and only five participants reported mild adverse events, all of whom chose to discontinue the intervention.Another important finding from the study was that TRE was well accepted by participants with adherence rates of 85−88%. "This kind of intermittent fasting appears feasible for adults with overweight or obesity who wish to have a relatively simple way of losing and maintaining weight loss that is less tedious and more time efficient compared with daily calorie counting, but it warrants further investigations in larger and longer-term studies," said Dr Jonatan R Ruiz, study coordinator from University of Granada, &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;nstituto de Investigación Biosanitaria de Granada (ibs.GRANADA) and Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Fisiopatologia de la Obesidad y Nutrición (CIBEROBN) in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

In a nationally representative sample of adults in the United States, only about 14% identified their romantic partner as their best friend. While these individuals reported more companionship in their lives, others who maintained a best friend outside their romantic relationship reported greater perceived social support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study aimed to understand the role of friendship within romantic relationships and whether having a partner who is also a best friend enhances relationship quality or well-being. Drawing on the convoy model of social relations—which suggests that people navigate life with a network of supportive ties—the researchers wanted to explore how personal and situational factors influence who we call a “best friend” and how this label relates to emotional closeness, routines, and psychological outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My primary area of research is interested in friendship, and I was teaching a class where I shared an Atlantic article that asked something along the lines of, what if friendship, and not romance, was the center of our lives?” said study author &lt;a href="http://www.nataliepennington.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Natalie Pennington&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor at Colorado State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would always get really mixed reactions, and it did get me thinking about the blurry boundaries of relationships and societal expectations as we get older. I had the opportunity to reflect on that through my work with &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305834" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The American Friendship Project&lt;/a&gt;, which is a project I co-lead that surveys connection and well-being in adults in the United States to better understand our relationships. In our datasets we keep the definition of friend quite broad, allowing people to self-identify romantic partners as a friend or as was the main focus of this study, a best friend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed data from 940 adults in romantic relationships who also had at least one person they considered a best friend. These participants were drawn from a larger national survey on friendship and social connection conducted in 2022. They ranged in age from 18 to 85, with a median age of 41, and represented diverse backgrounds in gender, race, income, and relationship status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked to list up to seven people they considered friends, without being told whether romantic partners should be included. For each person named, they could assign multiple labels such as “best friend,” “close friend,” or “romantic partner.” Additional measures assessed relationship closeness and routine interaction, as well as well-being outcomes like companionship, loneliness, stress, and social support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 36% of participants included their romantic partner in their list of friends. Of that group, 39.5% identified their partner as their best friend, translating to 14.4% of the total sample. The rest either did not list their partner at all or did not assign them the “best friend” label. Interestingly, a subset of those who called their partner a best friend also named other best friends, suggesting that these roles aren’t always exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is not technically the main focus of the study, but I did think it was interesting that some people (about 25% of the sample) labeled more than one person their best friend,” Pennington told PsyPost. “Sometimes socially I think there is this feeling of ‘I can only have one best friend’ and so I liked seeing that people didn’t always adhere to that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I also really thought we would see more people label their best friend their romantic partner! There are not a lot of studies on this topic, but past research has been much more direct in asking “do you think your romantic partner is your best friend?” and so I wonder if part of our lower number comes from some people thinking they weren’t supposed to include their romantic partner as a friend (we didn’t tell them one way or the other). So on the one hand I think that’s one of the things that is useful with our study — you really see the unprompted potential of people saying they see their romantic partner as a friend or best friend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then explored which types of people were more likely to describe their romantic partner as their best friend. They found that older adults were slightly more likely to do so, while people with higher incomes and those who were married were less likely. Gender and the number of best friends a person had were not significantly related to the likelihood of giving a partner the “best friend” title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers compared the quality of friendships depending on whether a person’s best friend was their romantic partner. Those who saw their partner as their best friend reported stronger emotional closeness and more frequent routine interaction than those whose best friend was not a partner. This suggests that combining friendship and romance may strengthen the quality of the bond—at least in the eyes of the person who holds that view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the label “best friend” didn’t seem to make a difference when applied to romantic partners already considered a friend. Among participants who named their partner as a friend, those who also labeled them as a best friend did not rate their relationship as closer or more routine than those who simply called them a “friend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the best friend relationship, we compared participants who identified a different best friend in terms of their reported closeness and routine interactions with those who said their best friend was their romantic partner,” Pennington explained. “We found that those who had a best friend that was their romantic partner reported greater closeness and routines (which makes sense, because we do often tend to invest more time and energy into a romantic relationship).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the romantic relationship, this was what spurred the title of the article — what’s in a label? Here we had compared participants who had included their romantic partner in the named friend task but did not say their partner was their best friend with those who had labeled them as a best friend, again, looking at closeness and routines. For these tests, we found no major difference between the two, signaling that calling them a ‘friend’ or ‘best friend’ are somewhat interchangeable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also wanted to know whether calling your partner your best friend was associated with better mental and emotional health. To do this, they looked at several outcomes—life satisfaction, companionship, perceived stress, loneliness, connection, disconnection, and perceived social support. They found that those who named their partner as their best friend reported greater companionship in daily life. On the other hand, those who had a separate best friend reported feeling more socially supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Participants who had a best friend separate from their romantic partner reported higher levels of perceived social support,” Pennington told PsyPost. “This makes sense, because they have more people to turn to for help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Participants who had a best friend that was their romantic partner reported greater feelings of companionship, which was the idea that we have someone who will go to events with us, spend time together, etc. In this case again I think this makes sense, because when we are really close with our romantic partner, we might see them as our go to person for spending time together, and perceive them as more likely to feel like they have to say yes when we ask to do something.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings align with previous research suggesting that romantic partners can fulfill companionship needs, but friends might still be better positioned to offer certain types of emotional support. This may be especially true when people face challenges in their romantic relationships or when they have needs that their partner cannot meet alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights how socioeconomic factors shape relationship networks. Lower-income participants were more likely to call their partner their best friend and also reported lower overall well-being. This suggests that when people have fewer resources, they may lean more heavily on a romantic partner to meet emotional needs, which can increase vulnerability if that relationship is strained. Conversely, people with higher incomes may have more time and opportunity to maintain a wider circle of close friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s results offer insight into how people conceptualize the roles of romantic partners and friends in their lives. While labeling a partner as a best friend can be associated with increased companionship, it may also come at the expense of broader support networks. Having multiple sources of connection may be more beneficial than expecting one person to meet all emotional needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study has limitations. Since it was based on self-reports from a single moment in time, it’s unclear whether having a romantic partner as a best friend leads to better companionship, or if people who already feel close and connected are simply more likely to use that label. Also, the survey prioritized friendship, so participants may not have thought to include their partner among their friends unless prompted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could address these limitations by examining how relationships evolve over time and how people’s labels and behaviors shift across different life stages. Collecting data from both members of a couple could also offer richer insights into whether the view of a partner as a best friend is mutual, and whether shared perceptions improve well-being more than one-sided ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study encouraged me to think about new questions we can add to the survey going forward — thinking about, for example, gathering data about one’s romantic partner so we can make fuller comparisons,” Pennington said. “That said, our big goal with the American Friendship Project is to continue to provide insight into the state of friendship in the United States, which can include how inherently messy labeling can be — we really try with this data to show how at the end of the day it’s more about how we foster those connections through communication that matters the most. We hope to keep sharing what we learn not only through publications, but public outreach, and in the future, interventions based on our findings to help folks who may be struggling with connection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the loose, big picture takeaways about this study are — invest time and energy into the people who matter, as they are the ones who can be there to help you when you’re feeling down and to celebrate your wins. I’d also say that valuing friendship in a romantic partnership is a great thing, but there is also value in investing in platonic friendships to have that fuller network to support you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02654075251336872"&gt;What’s in a label?

Children who are routinely shamed, threatened, or belittled by adults may develop a hyperactive threat system and a blunted reward response, making trust and emotional regulation more difficult in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes affect not only emotional wellbeing but also a child’s ability to form healthy relationships and build self-worth. Experts emphasize that verbal abuse is preventable and call for greater public awareness and policy action to protect children’s mental and neurological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurodevelopmental Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Verbal abuse overactivates threat systems and dulls reward responses in children’s brains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Harm:&lt;/strong&gt; Early verbal abuse increases risks of anxiety, depression, and social dysfunction in adulthood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventable Harm:&lt;/strong&gt; Ending verbal abuse is critical for healthy brain development and long-term wellbeing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;The Conversation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harsh words can wound – and when directed at children, they can have a lifelong impact.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18692174/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20483374/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;has shown&lt;/a&gt; that when words are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24493840/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;routinely used&lt;/a&gt; by the adults in their lives to humiliate, shame or control children, they can alter the developing brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2023-072916" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; of over 20,500 UK adults found that one in five reported having been verbally abused as children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definitions of verbal abuse vary, but it is generally characterised by a sustained pattern of behaviour where criticism, threats or rejection of the child leads them to feel routinely belittled, blamed, threatened, frightened or ridiculed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the same as occasionally losing your temper with your children and saying something hurtful in the heat of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I and colleagues believe this shapes how a child sees the world, others, and themselves. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673608617067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Exposure to abuse&lt;/a&gt;, including verbal abuse, leads to an &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of anxiety, depression, suicide attempts and drug use in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has an impact on forming trusting relationships as an adult. Yet despite its devastating consequences, verbal abuse remains largely overlooked in public debate and policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventing verbal abuse – along with all forms of child abuse and neglect – is more than just a moral imperative. It is essential for healthy brain development and lifelong wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Changes in the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was among the experts brought together by Jessica Bondy, founder of the Words Matter charity, in the House of Commons in April 2025 to discuss the prevention of childhood verbal abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a neuroscientist, I have spent decades using brain imaging to understand how early adversity and trauma, including verbal abuse, can shape a young person’s development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now know that emotional abuse, including consistently hostile or demeaning language from adults, can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28295339/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;significantly alter&lt;/a&gt; the way a child’s brain perceives and reacts to the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several key brain systems are affected. For example, our threat system normally helps us stay safe by detecting danger and triggering a quick response – the well-known “fight or flight” reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in children subjected to frequent abuse, including verbal abuse, this system &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211011390?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;becomes hyperactive&lt;/a&gt;. Even neutral social cues – a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22258799/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;facial expression&lt;/a&gt;, or a joke or well-meaning comment – can be misinterpreted as threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verbal abuse also affects how children form relationships. In healthy development, warm verbal and non-verbal exchanges with caregivers – praise, compliments, thoughtful understanding – help teach children how to establish &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2920349/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;secure and healthy&lt;/a&gt; relationships. They also help them build self-worth and social confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But verbal abuse, along with other forms of childhood maltreatment, can blunt the brain’s reward system. The brain becomes less responsive to positive experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that these brain adaptations can alter how a maltreated child builds their social world. They may help the child survive in an adverse social environment, but over time they accrue long-term costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It becomes harder to trust others; harder to navigate relationships; harder to believe you are of real value and truly lovable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Lifelong consequences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By adulthood, the risk is that a repeated cycle of interpersonal stress and rupture &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35926524/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;is established&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21142355/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Romantic relationships&lt;/a&gt; can be destabilised by deep-seated fears of abandonment or rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those early wounds fold into our sense of self, creating an enduring lens through which the world is perceived. It can be a struggle to feel at ease in one own’s mind, or safe in the mind of another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to my research work at UCL, I am CEO of Anna Freud, a charity dedicated to transforming mental health support through evidence-based care, cutting-edge research, professional training and accessible resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our clinical work at Anna Freud, we have seen countless young people and adults struggle with the verbal messages they have received growing up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harsh language sticks because we are biologically wired to privilege negative and threatening information for our own protection. These verbal wounds underpin so much later anxiety, pain and distress. Adults can spend decades trying to compensate to prove those words wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to shine a light on the impact of verbal abuse, helping parents, carers, teachers and all adults in a child’s life understand the power of their words. This does not imply that poor behaviour should go unchecked; children still need clear limits and honest corrective feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it does mean creating environments – at home, at school, in communities – where children are spoken to with respect, encouragement and care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verbal abuse is not an inevitable part of growing up. It is preventable. And the science is clear: ending it is essential to safeguarding healthy brain development and improving life-long mental health outcomes. Society as a whole will benefit, with a new generation more likely to thrive in education and employment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to ensure every child is nurtured by words that build them up, not tear them down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurodevelopment and verbal abuse research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/eamon-mccrory-164142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eamon McCrory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Eamon McCrory – The Conversation&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255533/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-advanced" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 16:06:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE9NOWFXd2RHZUl3QzZrNUVrTnB2UXM3VW13RGpkcGVfX2JFQnVKR1N0bWJNd1dtVHFGVllZTm1vLXlnOHBjdE9VTGpQSDgwZkxhYUo1MzZZLUNIVFFiVTJFS05FSHVMcmJUZ1dSYg</guid></item><item><title>5岁儿童可以使用成人大脑系统导航地图-神经科学新闻 | Five-Year-Olds Can Navigate Maps Using Adultlike Brain Systems - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE5VNG1wUEN2VUdKUFRNZ1pxYzVYZ3V4aktScTNhZm81X3FzWlMzSklWd1B6NlVsdnI2ZnYzVGJ1aldzNGtQTTc5YkIxWDlnRklnNG5UVDZnRnAzX0ZfaURlUGpTTzUwd0RjeVFaYkZ0cXhMb0U?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research shows that the brain region supporting map-based navigation is active in children as young as five years old. Using a child-friendly virtual environment called Tiny Town, researchers demonstrated that young children can build and mentally hold maps to guide navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain scans confirmed that the retrosplenial complex—a region critical for spatial mapping in adults—was already functional in these young participants. The findings challenge previous beliefs that such cognitive abilities develop only after age 12 and shed light on the early emergence of complex spatial reasoning in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Navigation Ability:&lt;/strong&gt; Five-year-olds used brain systems to navigate using mental maps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RSC Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; The retrosplenial complex was active during map-based navigation tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtual Town Test:&lt;/strong&gt; Children learned and recalled locations in a simplified digital town called Tiny Town.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Emory University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many behavioral studies suggest that using landmarks to navigate through large-scale spaces — known as map-based navigation — is not established until around age 12.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neuroscience study at Emory University counters that assumption. Through experiments combining brain scans and a virtual environment the researchers dubbed Tiny Town, they showed that five-year-olds have the brain system that supports map-based navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109783"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a child navigating a virtual city and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The Dilks lab is now doing a deeper dive into the question of how the brain develops the ability to recognize and move about the world by working on a protocol for toddlers. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journal &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt; published the finding, the first neural evidence that this cognitive ability is in place in such young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While large-scale navigation abilities certainly continue to develop throughout childhood, our findings show that the underlying neural system is established remarkably early,” says Yaelan Jung, first author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow in Emory’s Department of Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather than taking a decade or more, map-based navigation is underway in half that time,” adds Daniel Dilks, associate professor of psychology and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Five-year-olds have the brain system enabling them to find their way around a tiny, virtual town. They not only know that the ice cream store in the mountain region is different than the ice cream store in the lake region, they know how to navigate the streets to get to each of them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping the visual brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dilks is at the forefront of identifying specific functions of the visual cortex related to face, place and object processing — how we recognize and get around our world. He’s also pioneering methods to study the timeline for the development of these functions, from infancy to adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Two fundamental questions in neuroscience,” he explains, “are how knowledge is organized in the brain and the origins of that knowledge. In other words, what knowledge are you born with and how does knowledge develop as you grow?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology of fMRI offers a window into those questions. The harmless, noninvasive technique uses a giant magnet to scan the brain and record the magnetic properties in blood. It measures heightened blood flow to a brain region, indicating that region is more active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In adult studies during the past decade, the Dilks lab has showed that three scene-selective regions in the brain perform separate, non-overlapping, tasks.  The parahippocampal place area (PPA) allows us to recognize places and cluster them into categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retrosplenial complex (RSC) maps the places into their proper locations within a larger space, allowing us to navigate from one place to another. The occipital place area (OPA) allows us to walk around our immediate surroundings, not bumping into boundaries or other obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can’t fix most neurological problems right now,” Dilks says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But by continuing to learn more about how the brain develops and functions normally, we keep moving closer to being able to repair it when something goes wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking navigation versus map-based navigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Dilks and Jung discovered that the brain system for walking through the immediate environment, avoiding boundaries and obstacles, does not look adultlike until age 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It seems counterintuitive,” Dilks says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most children can walk before the age of two. And yet the brain system helping you walk around your immediate surroundings doesn’t start appearing adultlike until relatively late.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dilks and Jung had a theory that the seemingly more complex and sophisticated abilities of map-based navigation develop earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They noted that even before they can walk well, children are carried from room-to-room and taken in strollers from place-to-place, allowing them to essentially build up a map of their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the current paper, they created experimental protocols for five-year-olds to test their theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They started with a virtual town known as Neuralville, developed by the Dilks lab for an adult study. It consists of eight buildings laid out on streets surrounding a town square and oriented by the four cardinal directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tests with five-year-old participants registered with the Emory Child Study Center, Jung soon learned that Neuralville was a bit too complicated for them to navigate. She simplified the paradigm, turning it into a triangle, and called it Tiny Town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of cardinal directions, distinctive landscapes delineate each point of the triangle, including the mountain corner, the tree corner and the lake corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She created six structures for Tiny Town, including two each of categories generally of interest to children: ice cream stores, playgrounds and fire stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making science fun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing experiments with child participants requires creativity and patience, Jung says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to get at the scientific questions that we’re trying to answer,” she explains, “but it’s also important that a child who participates in a study has a good time. We want them to leave with a good impression of science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jung first familiarized a child to the virtual town using the arrow keys on a computer to move through its streets and arrive at different places. She then invited the child to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was fascinating that they were so good at it,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This familiarization was followed by tests of their knowledge. She showed still images of Tiny Town to a child and asked questions such as: Did you see this building in Tiny Town? Is it in the mountain corner?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the children passed this test and moved into the next phase: training for scanning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jung turned the training process into a game involving the children and adult lab members. An adult would point at the child and say, “Freeze!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The kids loved it! They especially liked to freeze the adults in the room,” Jung says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’d point at one of us and say, ‘It’s your turn now!’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers explained to the participants that the scanner was like a camera and they would need to hold perfectly still so their photo wasn’t blurry when they performed a task while in the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The children were then trained to do the game-like task, pushing a button in response to paired images from Tiny Town. For instance, if an image of a particular fire station was shown with an image of mountains, they needed to push the button if this scenario mapped correctly onto Tiny Town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants practiced the task in a mock scanner before entering the real one for the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We gave them a blanket and a pillow to make it cozy and explained that they would be watching a movie in their own private theater,” Jung says. “They really liked that idea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting data showed that five-year-olds can learn a map and hold it in their minds. And to do so, they used their RSC — the brain region specialized for coding the location of buildings in a map, allowing us to navigate from one place to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The icing on the cake is that everyone involved in the study — including the researchers — enjoyed the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was really fun to work with the children,” Jung says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I learned that the age of five is a magical time to scan a child. They don’t tend to be afraid of new things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dilks lab is now doing a deeper dive into the question of how the brain develops the ability to recognize and move about the world by working on a protocol for toddlers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are proving a bigger challenge than infants and five-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Between the ages of two and three, children basically don’t listen to you,” says Jung, who is the mother of a three-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and her lab mates are trying out strategies involving a cardboard mockup of a scanner, cartoons and Cheerios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s fascinating to explore how humans use different parts of the brain for complex behaviors and how that changes with age and experiences,” Jung says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re laying the groundwork for clinical applications, including getting a better understanding of typical versus atypical neural development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this navigation and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#046765766b682a676865766f4461696b767d2a616071" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Carol Clark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://emory.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emory University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Carol Clark – Emory University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2503569122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Early development of navigationally relevant location information in the retrosplenial complex&lt;/a&gt;” by Yaelan Jung et al. &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early development of navigationally relevant location information in the retrosplenial complex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representing the locations of places so that we can use them as landmarks is critical to our ability to navigate through large-scale spaces—a process referred to as “map-based navigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many neuroimaging studies in adults have revealed that this ability involves the retrosplenial complex (RSC)—a scene-selective region in the medial parietal cortex—nothing is known about how this cortical system develops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, does it develop only late in childhood, as generally assumed from some behavioral studies? Or is it, perhaps counterintuitively, present in the first few years of life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this question, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) multivoxel pattern analysis and a virtual town paradigm, we investigated the representation of location information in the RSC of 5-y-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that i) the RSC in 5-y-olds already represents the locations of particular buildings in the town (e.g., the ice cream store by the mountain versus by the lake), but not their category membership (e.g., ice cream store, regardless of location), and ii) this neural representation is correlated with their performance on a location task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using multidimensional scaling, we also found that the neural representation of the buildings in RSC reflects the actual layout of the virtual town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the parahippocampal place area—a scene-selective region implicated in scene categorization, not map-based navigation—did not represent location information, but instead category information, the exact opposite of RSC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings reveal the early development of navigationally relevant location information in RSC and thus the early origins of map-based navigation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This competition isn’t just accelerating progress, it’s shattering the limits of what’s possible when it comes to ageing,” said Jamie Justice, the executive director of XPrize, run by the XPrize Foundation and backed by funders including the Hevolution Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The winning team should be able to restore these three systems by a minimum of 10 – but ideally 20 – years in humans aged 50 to 80. A key condition of the final prize is that the innovation is accessible to as many people as cheaply and easily as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another condition is that there will be no delay in rolling out the solution: the winning idea must be scalable in 12 months or less of the final award being made in 2030, after a final $81m one-year clinical trial in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Success will profoundly change our approach to ageing and positively affect quality of life and healthcare costs,” Justice said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;XPrize is not the only multimillion-dollar prize on offer to those striving to come up with an answer to ageing: the Saudi-backed Hevolution Foundation has pledged $1bn to fund longevity research, clinical trials and global collaborations over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Methuselah Mouse prize (Mprize) has committed more than $4.5m to extend the lifespan of mice as a proxy for delaying human ageing. The Rejuvenation Startup Challenge awards $2-3m to support startups with promising rejuvenation technologies. The Palo Alto longevity prize offers $1m to extend lifespan in mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;All these prizes are devised to address the fact that while global life expectancy has more than doubled in the last 100 years, the quality of our health as we age has stalled. There are enormous gaps around the world between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy: in the UK, women can expect to live up to 22 years in poor health. Men live on average 17 years with chronic illness, disability or reduced quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The aim of XPrize is not to develop cutting-edge therapeutics. “The standout aim is to redefine our approach to extending the healthy, quality years of human life,” Justice said. “The winning intervention will not be disease-specific and reactive, like modern medicine. Instead, it will target the mechanisms of biological ageing itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“That will propel our ability to address physical and cognitive functional decline, enhance resilience in the face of illness or disease, and ultimately delay the onset of disability and death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;On Monday, the biggest prize in the longevity field comes closer as 40 semi-finalist teams are pulled from the XPrize longlist, which comprised more than 1,000 scientists, clinicians, biomedical engineers, longevity technology leaders, pharmaceutical companies, students, biohacker groups and newcomers to the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These teams – 14 of which come from the UK – have suggested a wide range of innovations including pharmacological approaches, biological therapies and lifestyle-based interventions, and often combinations of all three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A common focus of solutions is to regenerate or maintain cellular and tissue function over time through biologics such as stem cell therapy. Immunotherapies and seeking to reverse age-related gene change at the molecular level are another approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;New or repurposed drugs are frequently posited as solutions by the competing teams, including metformin and rapamycin, for both of which funding has long been sought to clinically prove what many hope will be a breakthrough in anti-ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Of the devices proposed, most focus on electrical stimulation of neural pathways, neuromuscular activation or muscle maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;No matter how technologically advanced the oncoming solutions, Justice says nothing will replace diet and exercise – albeit highly personalised and specific techniques – as the central element in healthy ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’re not talking about your five a day here,” she said. “While wholefoods and supplements are the most commonly proposed nutritional solutions from our teams, they’re often suggested in combination with substances like nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a naturally occurring molecule that is gaining attention as a potential anti-ageing agent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Nutraceuticals – foods that offer health benefits beyond their nutritional value – also feature, with a focus on wheatgrass, seaweed, berries, proteins, amino acids, herbal products and metabolism-supporting compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Lifestyle and behavioural approaches are also prominent, often combined with cognitive training, sleep optimisation and community engagement. The most frequent combinations include aerobic and resistance exercise with dietary changes, as well as sleep health paired with meditation, prayer or breathing exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 15:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPd0d6M3Q3bmxBNjZaZWVPb2IzUzRhNlJ0Y21hNTZTcmRxaVp1YjBsR0k1RXFwSzdJSlV3WUpfMmxTZ0RJZ0NvU2N4X29GMEViRTNyYWRfN0NDNXE0NTJ6N3BvZlZ2cU5PV1JaWFAyRUlKUUZPT0dzenVsSFZwRFpmZUN4UEw1YVgtRWNibXo0Nm5fa0t6ZXJVS0VKYjljc1FZR0toOQ</guid></item><item><title>专家解释了“Ozempic脚”背后的真相，因为药物出现了令人担忧的副作用- LADbible | Experts explain truth behind ‘Ozempic feet’ as worrying side effect of drug emerges - LADbible</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxQV2dnLUZaTk40LXdtblo3TS16Q05HaDM5aWFHOU5hcldLUVRuR2VnemJsWmtKS2FtZmlWeWdGckE5aGMxSGVRUmJBWHdpbFMtREt3dWhXcDZWaktaQ0pYdmhCU0ZaRkJTalpiY1ZDd3hpUkwzT0VwbnpvcVZ2T1FUYWt3cFFKQl84VzlrM1FKZE1BNFU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Health experts have weighed in on the ongoing debate about 'Ozempic feet' following claims the side effect can be spotted on various celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;By now you're probably fully aware, or at the very least vaguely familiar, that GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic, Mounjaro and Wegovy are being used for weight loss reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Originally created as a &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/health"&gt;medication&lt;/a&gt;

Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The feet’s fat pads act as natural shock absorbers, and the rapid loss of tissue can leave the skin in the foot lax and unsupported."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Taking drugs like Ozempic can affect your feet (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;US-based cosmetic surgeon Dr Barry Weintraub also weighed in on the subject, revealing the jabs may impact how our body retains water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"As the heart becomes less taxed with extra weight, the water retention decreases, and the substructures of the foot (veins, tendons, bones) often become more visible," Dr Weintraub &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14614579/Ozempic-feet-Sharon-Osbourne-effect.html"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;

MRI scans revealed that the hippocampus and amygdala were enlarged in teens with obesity, especially those with high waist-to-height ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that youth from lower-opportunity neighborhoods had reduced brain development, with disparities even more pronounced among those with persistent abdominal obesity. Researchers warn that both under- and overgrowth in these brain areas may disrupt normal cognitive and emotional functioning, potentially increasing long-term risks for mental health issues and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Growth Disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; Obese teens had a 6.6% larger hippocampus and 4.3% larger amygdala.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; The amygdala was most affected in teens with high abdominal fat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Inequality:&lt;/strong&gt; Lower-opportunity environments worsened brain development outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;European Society for the Study of Obesity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Several areas of the brain, including regions that play a critical role in learning and memory and in the control of emotions, are larger in adolescents who are living with obesity, new research being presented at the European Congress on Obesity (ECO 2025) has found.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding, from a study of thousands of teenagers in the US, raises concerns that obesity affects not only physical health but also learning, memory and control of emotions, says lead researcher Dr. Augusto César F. De Moraes, of UTHealth Houston School of Public Health in Austin, Department of Epidemiology, Texas, U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is particularly alarming, given that the teenage years are such an important time for brain development,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109779"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and junk food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Obesity—particularly abdominal obesity—has been linked to changes in brain development in the past, with regions key to cognition and the regulation of emotions seemingly particularly vulnerable. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The percentage of children and adolescents worldwide who are living with obesity more than quadrupled among girls (from 1.7% to 6.9%) and among boys (from 2.1% to 9.3%) between 1990 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, it is estimated that more than one in three children aged 5 to 14 (36.2% of boys and 37.2% of girls) are living with overweight or obesity—equating to more than 15 million children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity—particularly abdominal obesity—has been linked to changes in brain development in the past, with regions key to cognition and the regulation of emotions seemingly particularly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health inequalities like poor access to quality education, safe neighborhoods and healthy food are well-known contributors to physical health problems—but their role in brain development and cognition is often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out more about how obesity and health inequalities affect brain structure and cognition, Dr. De Moraes and colleagues in the US, Brazil, and Spain analyzed data from 3,320 participants in the ABCD study, an ongoing study into how childhood experiences affect brain development and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were recruited from cities in 17 states and followed for four years, from 2016–2018 to 2020–2022. (For list of cities, see notes to editors.) The average age of participants at baseline was 9.9 years and 47.4% were girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were categorized based on obesity status, with further stratification by abdominal obesity (measured using waist circumference). At baseline, approximately 34.6% of participants were classified as having abdominal obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structural MRI scans assessed the volume of several brain regions of the brain’s subcortex, including the amygdala, hippocampus, caudate, accumbens, pallidum, putamen and thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health disparities were assessed using the Child Opportunity Index, which measures a child’s opportunities via the quality of neighborhood features such as education, walkability and access to healthy food and green space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several of the brain regions were larger in adolescents with abdominal obesity than in their peers without abdominal obesity. The biggest changes were seen in the hippocampus, which is involved in memory and learning, and the amygdala, which regulates, or controls, emotions, including fear, happiness, anger and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus was approximately 6.6% larger and the amygdala was about 4.3% larger in teens with abdominal obesity compared to those without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amygdala was particularly large in teenagers with very high levels of abdominal fat (a waist-to-height ratio over 0.5). This raises concerns that excess body fat affects how the brain handles emotions, say the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thalamus (which relays information about movement, hearing, taste, sight and touch) and caudate (which helps control movement) showed smaller increases in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that teens from lower-opportunity areas showed reduced development in key brain regions, such as the hippocampus, putamen and amygdala, compared with their peers in higher-opportunity areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This difference was even more pronounced among adolescents with persistent abdominal obesity,” says Dr. De Moraes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It highlights the urgent need to address both social inequality and health risks to support not only physical well-being but also healthy brain development in youth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors explain that in the context of the young developing brain, both decreased and increased growth can cause harm. Thus, having lower-than-normal brain development, as shown in the teens in lower-opportunity areas, or larger-than-normal parts of the brain due to inflammation caused by obesity, can both be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. De Moraes concludes, “Our findings suggest that obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, can impair teenagers’ learning, memory and control of emotions. I worry about how these changes, which are occurring at the age of 13 or 14, might affect them later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s even a chance they could be a higher risk of things like memory problems or dementia as they get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why we believe supporting healthier habits early on is so important, not just for physical health, but for brain health too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Treating and preventing adolescent obesity won’t only improve health—it may improve brain health, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this obesity, neurodevelopment, and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://easo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Augusto César F.

              &lt;p&gt;Pap smears are a vital tool for preventing cervical cancer because they can detect cell abnormalities before they become cancerous. Unfortunately, systematic barriers or a lack of comfort with the procedure means many people aren’t receiving it. But on Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/well/pap-smear-at-home-alternative-cervical.html"&gt;the FDA approved the first at-home test for cervical cancer screenings &lt;/a&gt;that is a less invasive and potentially more accessible alternative to pap smears.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The newly FDA-approved test was developed by San Francisco-based startup Teal Health. Like traditional pap smears, Teal Health tests for the human papillomavirus or HPV, which causes virtually all cervical cancers. However, it’s test, the Teal Wand, only requires a vaginal swab with a spongelike tool instead of inserting a speculum to scrape cells from the cervix.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a statement, Kara Egan, CEO and co-founder of Teal Health, &lt;a href="https://www.getteal.com/news/fda-approves-teal-healths-teal-wand-tm---the-first-and-only-at-home-self-collection-device-for-cervical-cancer-screening-introducing-a-comfortable-alternative-to-in-person-screening"&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;that the approval isn’t “just about an innovative product — it’s about finally giving women an option that makes sense for their lives — something that can be done quickly and comfortably at home.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Because when we make care easier to get, we help women stay healthy, for themselves and for the people who rely on them every day,” Egan continued.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the United States, about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cervical-cancer/statistics/index.html#:~:text=What%20to%20know,women%20die%20of%20this%20cancer."&gt;11,500 new cases&lt;/a&gt; of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year, and 4,000 people will die of it. However, cervical cancer could be “eradicate[d] in our lifetime,” Dr. Alexi Wright, the director of gynecologic oncology outcomes research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, told the New York Times. “We have the tools to do it. We just don’t have comprehensive HPV vaccination or cervical cancer screening, and often can’t reach the people who are at highest risk.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the American Cancer Society, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/cervical-cancer/about/key-statistics.html#:~:text=The%20cervical%20cancer%20death%20rate,higher%20than%20for%20White%20women."&gt;cervical cancer deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. have dropped by over half since the mid-1970s, although it has leveled off recently. One 2022 &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2788175#references-tab"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that 23% of people were behind on their screenings in 2019 compared to 14% in 2005. Although reasons vary, one &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9562154/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that lack of insurance and cost were common factors. In addition, cervical cancer rates are &lt;a href="https://hollingscancercenter.musc.edu/news/archive/2025/03/03/rural-us-counties-see-an-increase-in-cervical-cancer-rates#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20rate%20of%20cervical%20cancer,data%20between%202001%20and%202019"&gt;25% higher&lt;/a&gt; in rural areas, and the death rate is 42% higher, likely due to a lack of resources and health care providers. For some, discomfort is also a big barrier. In 2023, many participants in a Michigan Medicine study &lt;a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/medicine-michigan/end-pap-test"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that at-home kits “provide a comfortable, convenient, and flexible choice without trauma.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;At-home screenings are effective alternatives for closing the screening gap. One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31693128/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that mailing kits to people overdue for cervical cancer screenings saw a 50% increase compared to offering usual care alone. In addition, they are &lt;a href="https://permanente.org/hpv-home-testing-research-supports-better-cervical-cancer-prevention-and-screening/"&gt;just as accurate&lt;/a&gt; as clinical tests. (Teal Health also has a &lt;a href="https://www.getteal.com/research/u-s-clinical-study-demonstrates-94-of-women-prefer-at-home-cervical-cancer-screening"&gt;SELF-CERV&lt;/a&gt; study.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Teal Health plans to make kits available next month, starting in California. The company is also coordinating with major insurance providers in the hope of covering costs. In addition to requesting tests through Teal Health’s platform, people can coordinate follow-up care through it if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your skin’s health and appearance depend on a variety of factors, especially diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The foods you eat can provide nutrients that have been shown to keep skin youthful and radiant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Foods rich in vitamin C, omega-3 fats, isoflavones and zinc may improve signs of aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to keeping your skin looking youthful and vibrant, there’s no magical snack or superfood that will single-handedly stop the clock. The truth is, skin health is influenced by a mix of factors, including diet, lifestyle, genetics and how many times you’ve forgotten to apply sunscreen (we’ve all been there). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, experts agree that the right foods can offer &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291721/7-day-meal-plan-for-healthy-skin/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;important nutrients to support your skin’s health &lt;/a&gt;and give it that extra boost it deserves. So, we asked nutritionists to share their favorite foods for youthful, glowing skin. Here are their picks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-edamame"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Edamame  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
These little green soybeans may be a hidden secret for healthy skin. “Soy foods, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8049006/health-benefits-of-edamame/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;edamame&lt;/a&gt;, contain compounds called isoflavones, which may impact certain aspects of skin health,” says &lt;a href="https://www.claireobryan.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Claire O’Bryan, N.P&lt;/a&gt;. She points to a study that found that post-menopausal women who consumed 30 grams of a soy protein supplement that contained added isoflavones daily for six months experienced improvements in skin wrinkles and less dryness.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition to edamame, you can also get skin-supporting isoflavones from soy foods like tofu, tempeh, soy milk and soy yogurt. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-sweet-potatoes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Sweet Potatoes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-sweet-potatoes-healthy-8400304#:~:text=Sweet%20potatoes%20are%20a%20good,impact%20your%20weight%20very%20much." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sweet potatoes&lt;/a&gt; are not only satisfying and delicious. They’re also packed with nutrients that support skin health, especially vitamin C. One medium baked sweet potato provides roughly a quarter of the Daily Value of vitamin C.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Vitamin C helps promote collagen [synthesis], which is helpful for skin and joint health,” says &lt;a href="https://www.bucketlisttummy.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Sarah Schlichter, M.P.H., RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Sweet potatoes are also a natural source of beta carotene, a plant pigment that is converted to vitamin A, which helps protect your skin from infection.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Research reveals that beta carotene may also act like an internal sunscreen, helping to filter out some of the sun’s damaging rays.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-tomatoes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Tomatoes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like sweet potatoes, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-tomatoes-good-for-you-8636976" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tomatoes&lt;/a&gt; are rich in carotenoids that guard against sun damage, especially lycopene.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s not the only way tomatoes’ lycopene keeps your skin young and healthy. “This carotenoid can promote collagen production and reduce inflammation in the skin,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.thedietitiandish.com/about-me" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Patricia Kolesa, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. This, in turn, may help prevent the development of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Can’t find fresh tomatoes? Try canned tomatoes. Since heating frees up lycopene, the lycopene in canned tomatoes may be even more readily absorbed by the body.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even though tomatoes can do good things for your skin, they can occasionally cause skin issues for some people. For those with sensitivities or allergies to tomatoes, tomato consumption or direct tomato contact with your skin may lead to irritation, redness or even rashes. Additionally, tomatoes’ natural acidity can exacerbate certain skin conditions like eczema or acne, in some cases.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-orange-juice"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Orange Juice &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Orange juice is often hailed as a breakfast champion. But did you know it might secretly be your skin’s best friend, too? Orange juice, specifically 100% OJ, is packed with collagen-boosting vitamin C, for smoother, firmer, more resilient skin, says &lt;a href="https://nomadistanutrition.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mascha Davis, M.P.H., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. Just one 8-ounce glass of 100% orange juice provides nearly an entire day’s worth of vitamin C.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Since orange juice is nearly 90% water, it also supports hydration, making it a delicious and easy way to nourish your skin from the inside out, says Davis. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-kefir"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Kefir &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This tangy, probiotic-packed drink isn’t just great for your gut. It may help your skin better retain water for that moist, dewy glow. For instance, one small study found that women who drank slightly less than a half-cup of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7664397/what-is-kefir/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;kefir&lt;/a&gt; daily for eight weeks experienced significantly less skin dryness compared to a control group of women who didn’t consume kefir. Researchers suspect that kefir’s lactic acid bacteria, which is created during the fermentation process, help protect the skin’s natural barrier, improving its ability to hold onto water.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-pumpkin-seeds"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Pumpkin Seeds &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may not realize it, but your skin is your body’s largest organ. And one of its most important jobs is locking out illness-causing bacteria. So, it only makes sense that it needs certain nutrients to stay strong and healthy. Enter pumpkin seeds. “These tiny but powerful seeds contain zinc, a mineral which can aid in wound healing and reducing inflammation,” says &lt;a href="https://www.amandagodmannutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amanda Godman, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, 1 ounce of roasted pumpkin seeds delivers roughly 20% of the DV of zinc.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If acne is an issue (because you’re never too old for breakouts!), zinc-rich pumpkin seeds might also help. Research has found that zinc treatment may improve acne, especially since people with acne tend to have low serum zinc levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-salmon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 7. Salmon &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8040993/is-salmon-good-for-you/#:~:text=Offers%20Omega%2D3%20Fatty%20Acids&amp;amp;text=It%20aids%20in%20the%20absorption,salmon%2C%20has%20profound%20health%20benefits." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Salmon&lt;/a&gt; isn’t just great for your heart and brain health. It’s like a beauty secret served on a plate. “It’s rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which help reduce inflammation and can support the skin’s moisture barrier,” says &lt;a href="https://www.samanthadevitonutrition.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Samantha DeVito, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. Research shows that the long-chain omega-3 acids, DHA and EPA, may improve skin hydration and even reduce acne severity, especially since people with acne often have low EPA and DHA levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Salmon also contains an antioxidant called astaxanthin, which may help reduce skin inflammation, protect against UV damage and even improve skin elasticity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-spotlight--1-2-post mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight--1-2-post mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight mntl-block theme-1-2-post"&gt;&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading mntl-text-block"&gt;Skin-Healthy Recipes to Try&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; ​​Radiant, youthful skin isn’t just about fancy creams and lotions. The foods you eat can also make a significant difference in your skin’s appearance and overall health. According to dietitians, edamame, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, orange juice, kefir, pumpkin seeds and salmon are all delicious ways to keep your skin looking its very best. These foods are rich in skin-supporting nutrients, including isoflavones, vitamin C, probiotics, zinc and omega-3 fats. So, whether it’s adding pumpkin seeds to your oatmeal, sipping a glass of OJ with breakfast or snacking on a handful of edamame, every bite you take is one step closer to maintaining that youthful glow.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the haze of anesthesia, some patients undergoing surgery experience something you wouldn’t expect in this tense setting — vivid, sometimes disturbing sexual fantasies. In rare but striking cases, these dreams and hallucinations have blurred the lines between reality and delusion, leaving behind confusion, distress, and in some instances, legal fallout.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A growing body of literature is shedding light on an unsettling phenomenon: certain sedative and hypnotic drugs, especially those used in anesthesia, can provoke sexual hallucinations. These are not idle daydreams. They unfold with startling clarity, often in a logical sequence, and some patients recall them with an eerie sense of certainty.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/assets_task_01jttpmbj2frqv015dnxj9q9yg_1746800445_img_0.webp"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/assets_task_01jttpmbj2frqv015dnxj9q9yg_1746800445_img_0-1024x683.webp" alt="A higher percentage of men interpreted the hallucinations as being pleasurable while most women often felt them like assault" class="wp-image-283314" srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/assets_task_01jttpmbj2frqv015dnxj9q9yg_1746800445_img_0-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/assets_task_01jttpmbj2frqv015dnxj9q9yg_1746800445_img_0-750x500.webp 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/assets_task_01jttpmbj2frqv015dnxj9q9yg_1746800445_img_0-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/assets_task_01jttpmbj2frqv015dnxj9q9yg_1746800445_img_0.webp 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A higher percentage of men interpreted the hallucinations as being pleasurable while most women often described them as assault. Image generated using Sora/ChatGPT&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-hidden-side-effect"&gt;A Hidden Side Effect&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sedatives most commonly linked to these hallucinations include benzodiazepines like midazolam and diazepam, as well as propofol, ketamine, nitrous oxide, and even older agents like ether and chloroform. Most of these drugs act on GABA, a neurotransmitter that slows brain activity and induces relaxation — but in certain doses, they seem to open a peculiar erotic window into the subconscious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A recent blog post published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-brain-on-food/202505/several-sedative-drugs-may-give-you-sexual-fantasies"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; described &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36895011/"&gt;87 published cases&lt;/a&gt; of drug-induced sexual hallucinations. About 41% involved midazolam or diazepam, often at high doses. Patients have recounted everything from fleeting sexual dreams to distressing hallucinations of assault.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34552212/"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;of 110 dental surgery patients, 13.6% reported experiencing sexual arousal, dreams, or hallucinations during or after anesthesia. Most described them as dreams. But 10 percent reported sexual visions that were unpleasant and lingered into recovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sex of the medical team appeared to matter. In a report of roughly 300 male patients undergoing urological surgery, none reported sexual dreams when the team was all male. But when a female anesthesiologist was present, at least one patient did — and declined to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Women also reported these episodes, though differently. In a group of 130 female patients sedated with propofol and alfentanil, 12% showed amorous or disinhibited behaviors. Some patients later described these episodes as hallucinations. Others simply remembered feelings of exposure or vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-real-feelings-imagined-events"&gt;Real Feelings, Imagined Events&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2136615/"&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; from 1990 documented 41 incidents of women experiencing fantasies during sedation with intravenous midazolam or diazepam. Twenty-seven involved a sexual element, and twenty were described as unpleasant. These were not vague impressions. The events “occurred in a logical sequence and all were certain of their authenticity,” the study reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But here lies the disquieting twist: of 25 verified patient reports regarding occurrences during sedation, 17 turned out not to have occurred. In some of the remaining cases, the fantasies mirrored actual procedures or gestures, but with altered meanings. For instance, the pressure of a surgical swab might be reimagined as inappropriate touching.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The events felt real,” noted one researcher, “but independent witnesses confirmed they did not happen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such hallucinations have spurred legal complaints, often against health care providers who were later found to have done nothing wrong. The study concluded that “during or following sedation, lady patients should not be treated or examined without the presence of a responsible third person.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The question remains: why do some people experience these fantasies under sedation?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-their-chemical-romance"&gt;Their Chemical Romance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers point to the drugs’ actions on neurotransmitters like GABA and dopamine. Benzodiazepines and propofol, for example, enhance GABA’s calming effects. But in high doses, these effects may disinhibit certain brain regions — allowing suppressed thoughts or emotions to surface in exaggerated or distorted forms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some dopamine-enhancing drugs, such as those used for Parkinson’s disease or ADHD, have also triggered libido surges or sexual fantasies. Antipsychotics and antidepressants — especially those altering dopamine pathways — have been implicated too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRfidJNts6U&amp;amp;pp=ygUPa2V0YW1pbmUgZHJlYW1z"&gt;Ketamine&lt;/a&gt;, a dissociative anesthetic now also used in depression treatment, has caused some patients to experience graphic or distressing sexual visions. “One patient stated she would not undergo anesthesia again if ketamine was used,” a review found. During the Vietnam War, soldiers sedated with ketamine sometimes emerged with hallucinations of sexual assault — a phenomenon known as emergent psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Importantly, men were more likely to report fantasies, and often found them pleasurable. Women, however, reported more hallucinations resembling assault, and were more likely to find them disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-calling-saul"&gt;Calling Saul&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For health care professionals, these findings carry both clinical and ethical implications. The hallucinations, while rare, are vivid and potentially traumatizing. Some patients, believing the visions were real, have discontinued care or filed complaints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Although such sexual hallucinations and fantasies are rare, the vivid recollection of the patient’s experiences should be recognized and acknowledged,” the review warned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts now recommend that clinicians inform patients — especially those receiving high-dose sedatives — that such hallucinations are possible. They also urge protective protocols, like ensuring a witness is present, or using video monitoring, particularly during sensitive procedures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even if the events never happened, the emotional scars can be real.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One woman, after receiving sufentanil, propofol, and midazolam for a routine procedure, described a compelling urge to show the medical team a private tattoo — a hallucination she later found deeply distressing. Though no one had touched her inappropriately, the sense of violation lingered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As powerful as they are, sedatives don’t just quiet the mind — they sometimes unmoor it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, these drugs have made invasive procedures less painful and more bearable. Midazolam and diazepam, in particular, are considered among the safest short-term sedatives in medicine. But safety isn’t everything. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What happens under sedation may stay in the mind long after the drugs have worn off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Some events,” as the 1990 paper put it, “are very real to the patient — and yet, on the evidence of two or more independent witnesses, did not occur.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That contradiction makes these hallucinations especially thorny (I said thorny). The memories may be false, but the emotions they carry are not. And in medicine, that distinction matters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This mutation affects the sleep-wake cycle, leading to less sleep and potentially more deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors usually recommend at least seven to nine hours of sleep each night, with sleep deprivation in individuals linked to conditions such as Alzheimer's and heart disease.

These people [natural short sleepers], all these functions our bodies are doing while we are sleeping, they can just perform at a higher level than we can," study co-author Ying-Hui Fu, a neuroscientist and geneticist at the University of California, was quoted as saying by&lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/sleep/rare-genetic-mutation-lets-some-people-thrive-on-just-4-hours-of-shut-eye" rel="noindex,nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt; LiveScience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study identified one of these mutations, named SIK3-N783Y, in a human super-sleeper. Afterwards, the team studied the mutation in genetically modified mice and found that the rodent also got less sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that mice with the mutation slept around 31 minutes less than those without it, and 54 minutes less following a period of sleep deprivation, which was induced through gentle handling of the mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="v-ndtv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a mouse model, the presence of the NSS hSIK3-N783Y mutation leads to a decrease in sleep time and an increase in EEG delta power."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/man-dumps-girlfriend-after-her-phone-automatically-connects-to-hotel-wi-fi-8387664" rel="noindex,nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also Read | Man Dumps Girlfriend After Her Phone Automatically Connects To Hotel Wi-Fi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists added that the mutation caused structural changes affecting the protein's ability to transfer key phosphate molecules to other proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research said the study findings could lead to new therapies for sleep disorders and improve sleep quality in individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Further data analyses reveal additional kinases that could participate in the modulating network for sleep duration."&lt;/p&gt;

In mice, researchers found “goal-progress cells” that fire based on how far along the animal is in a behavioral task, enabling them to infer what comes next even in novel scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cells create internal maps of behavior rather than physical environments, allowing for flexible, generalised thinking. The discovery sheds light on how the brain supports everyday problem-solving and may inform future advances in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal-Progress Cells:&lt;/strong&gt; Neurons in the cortex track behavioral sequences, not spatial position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Memory:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice inferred task structure without prior exposure, showing true generalization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological AI Bridge:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings help connect brain function to adaptable AI systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;The Conversation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For decades, neuroscientists have developed mathematical frameworks to explain how brain activity drives behaviour in predictable, repetitive scenarios, such as while playing a game. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These algorithms have not only described brain cell activity &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627320304682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;with remarkable precision&lt;/a&gt; but also helped develop artificial intelligence with superhuman achievements in specific tasks, such as playing Atari or Go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109775"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a head and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The behaviour we compose to reach our goals is replete with repetition. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet these frameworks fall short of capturing the essence of human and animal behaviour: our extraordinary ability to generalise, infer and adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08145-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; late last year, provides insights into how brain cells in mice enable this more complex, intelligent behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike machines, humans and animals can flexibly navigate new challenges. Every day, we solve new problems by generalising from our knowledge or drawing from our experiences. We cook new recipes, meet new people, take a new path – and we can imagine the aftermath of entirely novel choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in the mid-20th century that psychologist Edward Tolman described &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1949-00103-001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the concept of “cognitive maps”&lt;/a&gt;. These are internal, mental representations of the world that organise our experiences and allow us to predict what we’ll see next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in the 1970s, researchers identified &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0006899371903581" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a beautiful system of specialised cells&lt;/a&gt; in the hippocampus (the brain’s memory centre) and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;entorhinal cortex&lt;/a&gt; (an area that deals with memory, navigation, and time perception) in rodents that form a literal map of our environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include “place cells”, which fire at specific locations, and “grid cells” that create a spatial framework. Together, these and a host of other neurons encode distances, goals and locations, forming a precise mental map of the physical world and where we are within it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now our attention has turned to other areas of cognition beyond finding our way around generalisation, inference, imagination, social cognition and memory. The same areas of the brain that help us navigate in space are also involved in these functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cells for generalising?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wanted to know if there are cells that organise the knowledge of our behaviour, rather than the outside world, and how they work. Specifically, what are the algorithms that underlie the activity of brain cells as we generalise from past experience? How do we rustle up that new pasta dish?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we did find such cells. There are neurons that tell us “where we are” in a sequence of behaviour (we haven’t named the cells).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To uncover the brain cells, networks and algorithms that perform these roles, we studied mice, training the animals to complete a task. The task had a sequence of actions with a repeating structure. Mice moved through four locations, or “goals”, containing a water reward (A, B, C and D) in loops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we moved the location of the goals, the mice were able to infer what came next in the sequence – even when they had never experienced that exact scenario before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When mice reached goal D in a new location for the first time, they immediately knew to return to goal A. This wasn’t memory, because they’d never encountered it. Instead, it shows that the mice understood the general structure of the task and tracked their position within it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice had electrodes implanted into the brain, which allowed us to capture neural activity during the task. We found that specific cells in the cortex (the outermost layer of the brain) collectively mapped the animal’s goal progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, one cell could fire when the animal was 70% of the way to its goal, regardless of where the goal was or how far away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some cells tracked progress towards immediate subgoals – like chopping vegetables in our cooking analogy – while others mapped progress towards the overall goal, such as finishing the meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these goal progress cells created a system that gave our location in behavioural space rather than a physical space. Crucially, the system is flexible and can be updated if the task changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This encoding allows the brain to predict the upcoming sequence of actions without relying on simple associative memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Common experiences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why should the brain bother to learn general structural representations of tasks? Why not create a new representation for each one? For generalisation to be worthwhile, the tasks we complete must contain regularities that can be exploited — and they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behaviour we compose to reach our goals is replete with repetition. Generalisation allows knowledge to extend beyond individual instances. Throughout life, we encounter a highly structured distribution of tasks. And each day we solve new problems by generalising from past experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A previous encounter with making bolognese can inform a new ragu recipe, because the same general steps apply to both (such as starting with frying onions and adding fresh herbs at the end).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose that the goal-progress cells in the cortex serve as the building blocks – internal frameworks that organise abstract relationships between events, actions and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we’ve only shown this in mice, it is plausible that the same thing happens in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By documenting these cellular networks and the algorithms that underlie them, we are building new bridges between human and animal neuroscience, and between biological and artificial intelligence.

A wealth of findings is beginning to reveal the algorithms that we use to map the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the biological algorithms that map the complex structured behaviours that we compose to reach our goals remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we reveal a neuronal implementation of an algorithm for mapping abstract behavioural structure and transferring it to new scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We trained mice on many tasks that shared a common structure (organizing a sequence of goals) but differed in the specific goal locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice discovered the underlying task structure, enabling zero-shot inferences on the first trial of new tasks. The activity of most neurons in the medial frontal cortex tiled progress to goal, akin to how place cells map physical space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These ‘goal-progress cells’ generalized, stretching and compressing their tiling to accommodate different goal distances. By contrast, progress along the overall sequence of goals was not encoded explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, a subset of goal-progress cells was further tuned such that individual neurons fired with a fixed task lag from a particular behavioural step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these cells acted as task-structured memory buffers, implementing an algorithm that instantaneously encoded the entire sequence of future behavioural steps, and whose dynamics automatically computed the appropriate action at each step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These dynamics mirrored the abstract task structure both on-task and during offline sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that schemata of complex behavioural structures can be generated by sculpting progress-to-goal tuning into task-structured buffers of individual behavioural steps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/254233/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-advanced" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 14:24:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE9XcGZqdXdLY3BwaUZab3B3UU41RER3ZnpWbTRBNERwTkh3c2tzd3RPcGRveUFjTWZoYkVDN1ZMbFlLdDNfOUVTbmMzQXVzQnZTZ0F6d2JCODJZdGZoUUdxeWhqenJXRTE3eXhzTHE0SEZ1b2RlNlE</guid></item><item><title>与社交焦虑相关的大脑节奏可以解释为什么错误会徘徊在记忆中- PsyPost | Brain rhythms tied to social anxiety may explain why mistakes linger in memory - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNVmxMU3JJT2hUMkJuSnJvcG9uMHhqQm5PSlR0ZzBCWlVWdVduTlNheTNhVHFGWXJDeEQzNDJiWkhMQUQ4cm44Q2N2X1dSMVZ3ckxwZGh0S0dIdnlsNFRPQ2t5blpkYkJFZUlCMnhSdXBDaFVnMGJsSGVFakZuTXFhZHBzQ1BaWXV6LTE3RmJxWnhLMzJaY3JsZVNtc1pOdEc5NUd1YV9R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with higher levels of social anxiety are more likely to remember faces they saw while making mistakes, and this may be due to how their brains respond to errors in the moment. A new study published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3758/s13415-024-01198-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cognitive, Affective, &amp;amp; Behavioral Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that social anxiety is linked to enhanced neural activity in the brain’s monitoring system during errors, which in turn predicts stronger memory for those moments. This finding could help explain why social anxiety persists over time and may eventually guide more targeted treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study sought to better understand how social anxiety affects the way people process and remember social situations. According to psychological models, individuals with social anxiety tend to focus more on their own mistakes and perceived flaws in social settings. This heightened self-focus can lead to biased memories, where negative moments are more likely to be remembered than positive or neutral ones. These memory biases can reinforce anxious beliefs and behaviors, creating a cycle that maintains or worsens social anxiety over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While previous research has shown that people with social anxiety exhibit stronger brain responses to errors, it remained unclear whether those neural responses had any lasting impact—such as changing how people remember what happened during social mistakes. The goal of the new study was to test whether brain activity related to error monitoring could help explain the memory biases seen in socially anxious individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My interest started when I was doing clinical rotations as an undergraduate. There, I saw that the usual treatments didn’t always work well for complicated brain problems. This made me want to use brain imaging to understand the brain better,” said study author Kianoosh Hosseini Ghalebin, a cognitive neuroscience PhD candidate at Florida International University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My path led me to pursue a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience at Florida International University (FIU), working with &lt;a href="https://www.ndclab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. George Buzzell&lt;/a&gt; and the Neural Dynamics of Control Laboratory, within the &lt;a href="https://ccf.fiu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Center for Children and Families (CCF)&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As I got further into my PhD work, I became really interested in neural oscillations, which are like the brain’s electrical rhythms,” Hosseini explained. “I liked them because they offer a direct way to see what the brain is doing while it’s happening. These rhythms don’t just reflect ongoing brain activity; they can also be manipulated externally. For instance, stimulating specific brain regions at particular frequencies can alter cognitive functions and related behaviors. This ability to both measure and change brain activity makes these rhythms a powerful tool for understanding why complex conditions arise in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Building on this, I became especially interested in social anxiety, given its high prevalence and the persistent challenge it poses for treatment. Cognitive models suggest that biased thinking and memory—especially focusing on and remembering mistakes—are key reasons why social anxiety lasts. Meanwhile, brain research has found different brain activity in people with social anxiety, like their brain being extra sensitive to mistakes (i.e., enhanced error monitoring) in a part called the mediofrontal cortex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Working together with Drs. Buzzell, Pettit, and Mattfeld at FIU/CCF, we saw a good opportunity to connect these two ideas—enhanced error monitoring and biased thinking and memory in individuals with social anxiety—by using neural oscillations, particularly the theta rhythms recorded over the mediofrontal cortex, as a way to observe in real time the brain activity that might be causing these cognitive biases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research is based on the idea that this enhanced error monitoring, reflected in these oscillations, could lead to people remembering negative social events more strongly and in a biased way,” Hosseini continued. “This mechanism might help explain why social anxiety is so persistent. Ultimately, identifying such concrete neural mechanisms could pave the way for more targeted and effective interventions, moving beyond symptom descriptions to directly address the underlying brain processes that maintain social anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, the researchers developed a novel experimental task called the Face-Flanker task. Participants completed this task while their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). The task was designed to simulate a socially evaluative situation: participants were told their performance would be observed and judged, and each trial featured a unique face image in the background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During each trial, participants saw an array of five arrows and had to respond to the direction of the center arrow while ignoring the others. The background included a face from a diverse database of neutral expressions. The task was structured to induce mistakes, especially on trials where the surrounding arrows pointed in the opposite direction from the center arrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completing the task, participants were given an unexpected memory test. They were shown a mix of faces—some they had seen during the task and some they had not—and asked to identify which ones were familiar. This allowed the researchers to assess whether participants were more likely to remember faces that had appeared during error trials compared to correct ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-four adults initially took part in the study, but after excluding those who made too few mistakes or had unusable data, the final behavioral analysis included 32 participants. Of these, 24 participants had EEG recordings suitable for analyzing brain activity. Participants also completed a self-report questionnaire measuring social anxiety symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on a specific type of brain activity known as theta oscillations, particularly those originating in the medial frontal cortex—a region known to play a key role in monitoring errors. They analyzed both the power (strength) and synchrony (timing consistency) of these brain signals. They also examined how strongly the medial frontal cortex synchronized with sensory areas of the brain, especially those involved in processing visual information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results revealed a consistent pattern. People with higher levels of social anxiety showed stronger synchronization of theta waves in the medial frontal cortex and between that region and visual sensory areas during errors. This enhanced brain synchrony was not present during correct responses, suggesting it was specific to error processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A couple of our findings were particularly interesting,” Hosseini told PsyPost. “What stood out was the specific nature of the brain activity linked to social anxiety symptoms. Instead of just seeing a general increase in the strength (power) of error-related theta brain waves, we found that higher social anxiety was specifically associated with the synchrony—the coordinated timing—of these waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was evident both within the mediofrontal cortex (MFC), a key region for error processing, and notably, in the communication between the MFC and sensory (visual) processing areas. This finding provides a more nuanced picture than simply concluding that social anxiety involves generally increased error monitoring. It suggests a specific mechanism involving potentially altered communication between error detection and sensory processing regions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, social anxiety symptoms were also associated with a memory bias: individuals with higher anxiety were more likely to recognize faces that had appeared during their mistakes. This was true even though, on average, the group as a whole did not show a significant memory difference between error and correct trials. The memory bias was more pronounced in those whose brains showed the strongest synchronization between the frontal and sensory regions during mistakes. In other words, the more their brain circuits responded to errors, the more likely they were to remember the faces they saw during those moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding provides a potential explanation for why social anxiety persists. If people with social anxiety are more likely to remember their social errors—and this is linked to how their brains respond to mistakes—it could lead to a distorted self-image over time. They may replay negative social memories more often, fueling worry and avoidance in future interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research highlights two key findings regarding individuals with higher social anxiety symptoms,” Hosseini said. “First, they demonstrate heightened brain activity when registering their own mistakes, reflecting more intensive error monitoring. Second, they show an enhanced ability to recall contextual details that were present when those errors occurred, even without actively trying to memorize them. This combination points toward a potential brain mechanism contributing to social anxiety: the act of monitoring errors more intensely may inadvertently strengthen the memory trace for associated information present during those moments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Building on this, our more recent (unpublished) research adds a layer of specificity: this memory bias appears selective for social information. We found that higher social anxiety predicted better memory specifically for faces present during errors, but showed no such relationship for non-social objects present during errors. This distinction is significant; it implies the underlying mechanism isn’t simply a general memory boost around errors for anxious individuals, but is specifically tuned to enhance the encoding of social cues during mistakes. This provides a more direct potential pathway linking error processing biases to the maintenance of social anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that their task allowed them to isolate the effect of error-related brain activity on memory formation in a way that past studies could not. Because each trial used a unique face and was followed by a surprise memory test, the researchers could more precisely link neural activity at the time of the error to later memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study has some limitations. It included a relatively small number of participants, and most were young adults, predominantly female and Hispanic, from a university population. These factors limit how broadly the findings can be generalized. Also, while the results show a link between brain responses to errors and memory biases, they cannot prove causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was a proof-of-concept study with a relatively small sample size, primarily undergraduate students, so the findings need replication in larger, more diverse groups,” Hosseini noted. “Also, our study design is correlational, meaning we can show associations between error monitoring, incidental memory bias, and social anxiety, but we cannot definitively prove causation—such as that social anxiety results in enhanced error monitoring, which then causes a memory bias that maintains social anxiety. Longitudinal studies and methods that can probe causality are needed to track these factors over time and better understand the causal relationships.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore how these brain-based memory biases interact with other aspects of social anxiety, such as rumination after social events. It is also important to investigate whether similar patterns emerge with different types of memory, like intentional recall or emotional memory, and whether this brain activity is specific to social stimuli or occurs with other types of mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that identifying how brain signals shape memory in social anxiety could help inform new interventions. For instance, non-invasive brain stimulation might be used to modify the neural circuits involved in error processing, potentially reducing the lasting impact of social mistakes on memory and self-perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our ultimate goal is to identify concrete neural mechanisms involved in social anxiety, such as the oscillatory dynamics linking error monitoring and memory bias,” Hosseini said. “Determining these mechanisms is important because it could eventually inform the development of targeted and effective treatments, potentially through causal interventions like non-invasive brain stimulation aimed at modulating the specific neural circuits identified.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Building on our current findings, we plan to use longitudinal studies to determine if this link between error monitoring and memory bias prospectively predicts changes in social anxiety symptoms over time. Furthermore, we hope to investigate how these error- and memory-related processes interact with other key features of social anxiety, such as post-event rumination, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the disorder’s neurocognitive underpinnings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Finally, I would like to acknowledge the invaluable support from the Center for Children and Families (CCF) at Florida International University and express my sincere gratitude to my co-authors, Jeremy W.

These components have caught attention for their potential to aid normal nerve functioning in older adults. They may also help ease oxidative damage in brain tissue by scavenging free radicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fungal-diseases-that-infect-humans-are-becoming-more-common-in-warming-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fungal extracts&lt;/a&gt; appear to reduce harmful inflammation. That matters because chronic inflammatory reactions in the brain can lead to diminished thinking skills and worsen certain diseases of the nervous system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By restraining the overproduction of pro-inflammatory substances, fungi may help maintain a steadier internal environment for nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-aging-populations-raise-the-stakes"&gt;How aging populations raise the stakes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As people live longer, the number of those affected by diseases of the nervous system is expected to rise sharply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age is one of the biggest risk factors for conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/17-year-old-man-breaks-the-world-record-for-early-onset-alzheimers-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/pesticide-exposure-increases-the-risk-of-parkinsons-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt;, which makes prevention and early support more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This current trend is pushing scientists to find solutions that don’t rely solely on synthetic drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many older adults prefer natural options with fewer side effects, and medicinal mushrooms could offer one such path if their benefits continue to be confirmed through research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-these-fungi-stand-out"&gt;Why these fungi stand out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern pharmaceuticals for diseases of the nervous system often work on specific symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet they don’t always slow the actual progression of conditions like Alzheimer’s. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5987239/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Scientists&lt;/a&gt; suspect some mushrooms could do more than manage symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early findings hint at better antioxidant protection and improved cellular cleanup processes, which are vital for the brain’s long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31460832/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; also note that certain fungi support a balanced &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gut-bacteria-influence-our-social-behavior-and-sense-of-fairness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;intestinal microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. The microbiome influences health beyond digestion by affecting how the body regulates mood, memory, and inflammatory signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A healthy gut environment often aligns with greater mental sharpness, which is why the microbiome has turned into a hotspot for brain-related research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-research-shaping-potential-therapies"&gt;Research shaping potential therapies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extracts of species such as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92757/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ganoderma lucidum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have drawn a lot of interest for their neuroprotective properties. They appear to regulate immune cell activity in ways that safeguard fragile neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, compounds from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667142523000143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cordyceps militaris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; seem promising in stroke and Parkinson’s models, possibly due to their ability to moderate excessive inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests in laboratory models indicate these mushrooms can be gentle on the body. When used with standard treatments, they might help patients manage symptoms while protecting nerve cells against oxidative harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efforts are now underway to transform these natural agents into standardized preparations that could be easier for people to incorporate into daily regimens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-turning-lab-results-into-real-solutions"&gt;Turning lab results into real solutions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical researchers are still exploring which precise compounds in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-species-of-glowing-mushrooms-discovered-mycena-crocata/"&gt;mushrooms&lt;/a&gt; can cross the blood-brain barrier. That information matters for designing targeted therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get there, advanced tools like mass spectrometry and molecular modeling are helping identify the relevant components. After verifying safety and purity, scientists will need to track long-term outcomes in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical and food industries are keen to develop mushroom-based products that are convenient to consume. Capsules, powders, and functional beverages could all become options in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although these ideas are still in development, initial patents and prototypes have started to appear, reflecting the potential for more widespread use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exploring-safety-and-public-trust"&gt;Exploring safety and public trust&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before mushroom-based therapies can gain traction, people want to know they’re safe. Although many of these &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hundreds-of-fungi-species-are-threatened-with-extinction/"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt; have been consumed for centuries in traditional medicine, formal clinical testing is needed to confirm their safety in concentrated forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are calling for long-term toxicity studies and more trials in diverse human populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would help build public trust and ease the concerns of doctors and health regulators who are cautious about introducing natural compounds without thorough vetting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-challenges-and-hopes"&gt;Challenges and hopes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people worry about taking unregulated supplements, and that is where standards come in. Researchers and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-twenties-can-make-or-break-your-heart-health/"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; agencies alike stress the importance of careful quality checks, especially as more individuals look to nontraditional therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By setting guidelines for dosage and composition, consumers could gain safer access to these mushrooms’ useful attributes. Coordinated efforts will likely speed progress in this field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialists from multiple disciplines are combining laboratory data with patient observations to make sure any mushroom-based approach is both reliable and backed by evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This blend of natural wisdom and modern science might yield new ways to manage conditions that have stumped clinicians for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1750-3841.70230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Food Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 13:49:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQM2lRdWlCRWdHZjhhRDFTd3ZoQ1hJQ1VTTk5yV0tMck1tMmpRaDdjLTF4M0ZnZTc4NU9FeVNxcmhrQldqYmdENVNQYnhBM3A0Qy1DdlpyNTJ6YUwzYXdUOXlKakJxRHJzVW42dmt2ejZOU1dacWZEcm92dE9TQmwyMmNnYTgzU1cwYU9tN0JSU3E1SW1rR2E1R3RkOS1feGx6RUd4NE8teEk0SHlHQjdzMU0wUTJyQQ</guid></item><item><title>三个不眠之夜可能会伤害你的心脏-神经科学新闻 | Three Sleepless Nights May Harm Your Heart - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxOdGdZSXdwN0hOTnpPUHBVRFozNTVzbHMwaTRpZDQtZEN6c0xVX1dkMzlOeHhhejNpbjRBTXZMRHlZeHVPeUlzSW56a0VRbml0WWFrZElERjBTNWh1VTI0cXdlSW1qWUJscDJYdi1TdkFrazdNU2J4YVpFTUp1VXlyODBB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study shows that even short-term sleep deprivation activates inflammatory proteins in the blood linked to cardiovascular disease. After just three nights of sleeping four hours per night, healthy young men showed increased levels of proteins associated with heart failure and coronary artery disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While exercise still triggered beneficial proteins, the heart may face greater strain when sleep is lacking. These findings highlight the critical role of sleep in heart health, even in otherwise healthy individuals, and suggest that sleep and exercise should be viewed as complementary, not interchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Just 3 nights of poor sleep elevated inflammation-related proteins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; Heart risk markers increased even in young, healthy individuals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise Helps, But Not Enough:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical activity can’t fully offset sleep loss effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Uppsala University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even a few nights with insufficient sleep promote molecular mechanisms linked to a greater risk of heart problems. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been shown in a new study in which the researchers investigated how sleep deprivation affects biomarkers (in this case proteins) associated with cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was led from Uppsala University and is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Biomarker Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109768"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person sleeping and a heart." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers have previously shown that exercise in the presence of sleep deprivation can result in a slightly increased load on the heart’s muscle cells. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, nearly half of all Swedes regularly experience disturbed sleep, and this is particularly common among shift workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is why we wanted to try to identify mechanisms that affect how lack of sleep can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Ultimately, the purpose was to identify opportunities to address these problems,” says Jonathan Cedernaes, physician and docent at Uppsala University, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chronic lack of sleep is a growing public health problem and in large population studies it has been linked to an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart health is influenced by several lifestyle factors, including sleep, diet and exercise. In order to separate out the effects of sleep, a number of conditions were controlled in the laboratory environment such as diet and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the study was conducted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors studied 16 healthy young men of normal weight. They all had healthy sleep habits. The participants spent time in a sleep laboratory where their meals and activity levels were strictly controlled in two sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one session, participants got a normal amount of sleep for three consecutive nights, while during the other session, they got only about four hours of sleep each night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During both sessions, morning and evening blood samples were taken, and following high-intensity exercise lasting 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammatory proteins increased after sleep loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers measured the levels of around 90 proteins in the blood and were able to see that the levels of many of these that are associated with increased inflammation rose when the participants were sleep-deprived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these proteins have already been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease such as heart failure and coronary artery disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many of the larger studies that have been done on the link between sleep deprivation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases have generally focused on slightly older individuals who already have an increased risk of such diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is why it was interesting that the levels of these proteins increased in the same way in younger and previously perfectly healthy individuals after only a few nights of sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means that it’s important to emphasise the importance of sleep for cardiovascular health even early in life,” says Jonathan Cedernaes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The effects of exercise can be affected by lack of sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical exercise generated a slightly different response after lack of sleep. However, a number of key proteins increased equally, whether the person was sleep-deprived or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, proteins that can be linked to the positive effects of exercise increased, even if the person had too little sleep. The researchers have previously shown that exercise in the presence of sleep deprivation can result in a slightly increased load on the heart’s muscle cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With this study, we have improved our understanding of what role the amount of sleep we get plays in cardiovascular health. It’s important to point out that studies have also shown that physical exercise can offset at least some of the negative effects that poor sleep can cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it’s also important to note that exercise cannot replace the essential functions of sleep,” says Jonathan Cedernaes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Further research is needed to investigate how these effects might differ in women, older individuals, patients with heart disease, or those with different sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our ongoing research will hopefully help to develop better guidelines on how sleep, exercise and other lifestyle factors can be harnessed to better prevent cardiovascular diseases,” says Jonathan Cedernaes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was carried out in collaboration with researchers at Akershus University Hospital and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, and was supported by the Swedish Society for Medical Research (SSMF), the Göran Gustafsson Foundation, the Swedish Diabetes Foundation, and &lt;em&gt;Hjärnfonden&lt;/em&gt; (the Swedish Brain Foundation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and cardiovascular disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6401080d0a4a0605070f1710160b092411114a1701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elin Bäckström&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uu.se" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Uppsala University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Elin Bäckström – Uppsala University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40364-025-00776-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Overlooked Trio: Sleep Duration, Sampling Time and Physical Exercise Alter Levels of Olink-Assessed Blood Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Risk&lt;/a&gt;” by Jonathan Cedernaes et al. &lt;em&gt;Biomarker Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overlooked Trio: Sleep Duration, Sampling Time and Physical Exercise Alter Levels of Olink-Assessed Blood Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biomarker profiling from biofluids such as blood are widely measured in clinical research, using for example Olink proteomics panels. One such research focus area is cardiovascular disease (CVD), for which chronic sleep restriction (SR) is a risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it remains unclear whether blood levels of commonly measured CVD biomarkers are sensitive to acute dynamic factors such as SR, physical exercise (PEx), and time of day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this crossover design, 16 normal-weight, healthy men underwent three highly standardized in-lab nights of SR (4.25 h/night) and normal sleep (NS, 8.5 h/night) in randomized order, with 88 CVD blood protein biomarkers quantified using the Olink technology (and selected validation using ELISA) in the morning, evening, and immediately before and repeatedly after 30 min of high-intensity exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found significant time-of-day-dependent changes in several CVD biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas several proteins were exercise-induced across sleep conditions (such as the canonical exerkines IL- 6 and BDNF), exercise-induced proteomic dynamics differed in response to recurrent SR, compared with following NS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, SR compared with NS resulted in a biomarker profile previously associated with increased prospective risk of several CVDs across large-scale cohorts (such as higher circulating levels of IL-27 and LGALS9). Our findings highlight how dynamic physiology can modulate CVD biomarker levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results also underscore the need to consider sleep duration as a key determinant of cardiovascular health—an emphasis reflected in recent American Heart Association guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies in women, older individuals, and patients with prior CVD, and across different chronotypes and dietary schedules are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 13:27:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOdGdZSXdwN0hOTnpPUHBVRFozNTVzbHMwaTRpZDQtZEN6c0xVX1dkMzlOeHhhejNpbjRBTXZMRHlZeHVPeUlzSW56a0VRbml0WWFrZElERjBTNWh1VTI0cXdlSW1qWUJscDJYdi1TdkFrazdNU2J4YVpFTUp1VXlyODBB</guid></item><item><title>高胆固醇的一个微妙症状会影响眼睛- Surrey Live | One subtle symptom of high cholesterol can affect the eyes - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxPN0puMEQ1aFQ1dUF2QmtqZGQ1ek91dDg0em1NZlgzSTNVMHdsNm9VTTA0c09KdDJXYmw1eW9vQVFJSGphdE1xV2ZjcWp0WVV6YzJUU2tGMzFUNGdISDhhU1Rxa0dPanVtdVBqRndiQS1nSEduVHFrV20tTGxTd2NHbDB5ekJ3SExrcDRWRA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol is a waxy substance found in the blood that is essential for building cells and producing hormones.

However, there are some visible warning signs that people may ignore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31617251" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Dave said: "Severe cases can cause chest pain or symptoms of a heart attack or stroke. Less commonly, yellowish deposits around the eyes (xanthelasma) or fatty bumps on the skin (xanthomas) may appear."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Danish study involving more than 10,000 participants found that individuals with xanthelasma had a higher risk of coronary heart disease and heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;High cholesterol can also greatly increase the risk of a stroke, with the &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Stroke Association &lt;/a&gt;reporting that the condition can increase the risk by 10 per cent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In light of Stroke Awareness Month this May, Dr Dave noted: “Imbalanced cholesterol levels significantly increase the risk of stroke by damaging and obstructing blood vessels that supply the brain. High levels of bad cholesterol contribute to the buildup of fatty deposits (plaques) in the arteries, and these plaques can narrow or block blood vessels, reducing blood flow to the brain.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;British Heart Foundation&lt;/a&gt; identifies corneal arcus as another eye-related symptom that people with high cholesterol, caused by inherited factors, may experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31617252" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;span class="caption" itemprop="description"&gt;High cholesterol can also greatly increase the risk of a stroke, by around 10 per cent&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), is an inherited condition, meaning you were born with it. It is often passed through families in faulty genes and can cause high cholesterol levels, regardless of other risk factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Corneal arcus is a pale white ring around the coloured part of your eye, your iris.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the BHF noted that these symptoms are often overlooked as there are usually “no symptoms of high cholesterol”. It warned: “Left untreated, high cholesterols can lead to heart attack and stroke.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How to tell if you have high cholesterol&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The NHS advises people to book in for a blood test if they are concerned about high cholesterol or have any unusual symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This test can be done at a GP surgery and measures:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total cholesterol – the overall amount of cholesterol in your blood&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good cholesterol (called HDL) – This may make you less likely to have heart problems or a stroke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-HDL (bad) cholesterol – the difference between total cholesterol and HDL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health professionals will consider factors such as your age, blood pressure and health conditions to determine whether you have “healthy” cholesterol levels. Combined, these measures determine your risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the UK, people aged 40 and over are encouraged to have their cholesterol levels measured every five years as part of free NHS health checks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How to lower cholesterol&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31617257" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;span class="caption" itemprop="description"&gt;A heart-healthy diet can manage cholesterol levels&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many simple ways to manage your cholesterol levels from home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;Adopt a heart-healthy diet&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Dave recommends focusing on foods rich in fibre (like oats, legumes, fruits, and vegetables) and healthy fats (like those in nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish). Cut back on saturated fats, trans fats, and processed foods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;Exercise regularly&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate activity (like brisk walking, cycling, or swimming) most days of the week to boost HDL (good cholesterol) and lower LDL (bad cholesterol).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;Maintain a healthy weight&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;Losing even a small amount of weight can improve cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;Quit smoking and limit alcohol&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smoking lowers good cholesterol and damages blood vessels. Excessive alcohol can raise cholesterol and triglyceride levels, so moderation is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 13:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPN0puMEQ1aFQ1dUF2QmtqZGQ1ek91dDg0em1NZlgzSTNVMHdsNm9VTTA0c09KdDJXYmw1eW9vQVFJSGphdE1xV2ZjcWp0WVV6YzJUU2tGMzFUNGdISDhhU1Rxa0dPanVtdVBqRndiQS1nSEduVHFrV20tTGxTd2NHbDB5ekJ3SExrcDRWRA</guid></item><item><title>揭开RFK Jr.关于疫苗的“双峰” --《华盛顿邮报》 | Unpacking RFK Jr.’s ‘doublespeak’ on vaccines - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxOX0Q1bi1OcG1TNzJtakdvcXNhODhBSENfV24zTmEzYktwTjNIVFhTRHcweDNHdngwZlFHYjljN1NZekZLLVhMMzVDT1ZsamtmZHRVRGZNUDBDQzRzcXpQXzdueWpFRnYyblBrN25JSkVQU1ItUnUwM0FMZVBWY3piRTNSdTBtMzA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P815M6WYXH3BZ33GZQMH9B5HXC" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Early last month, after two Texas children had died &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;of measles&lt;/a&gt;, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. acknowledged that the MMR vaccine prevents the spread of that virus.

His “doublespeak,” as public health experts and academics who follow the anti-vaccine movement&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;call it, gives him cover with both groups, allowing him to court public opinion while still assuaging his anti-vaccine base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="0E7NKXWG8H71KDGKN3Y8PTW6HW" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At least half of adults are uncertain whether to believe&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;false claims about measles, its vaccine and its treatment, according to &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-the-publics-views-on-measles-outbreaks-and-misinformation/"&gt;an April poll by the health-care think tank KFF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WWUVUYTV3BDCJOEIYKQD3AF2RA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s confusing, and maybe that’s part of the strategy,” said Bruce Gellin, who oversaw HHS’s vaccine program in the Bush and Obama administrations.

Experts worry the United States this year will record the largest number of cases since measles was declared eliminated a quarter-century ago. A recent study showed that if U.S. vaccination rates continue to decline, the nation could &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/24/measles-cases-deaths-vaccine-rates-rfk-jr/"&gt;face millions&lt;/a&gt; of cases over the next 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VDYEPAQZJJGCDI6ODHC56RMTJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Once an outbreak begins, health officials have only a short time to convince the U.S. public that vaccination is the proven way to save lives, said Chrissie Juliano, executive director of the Big Cities Health Coalition.

Shortly thereafter, Kennedy wrote in an &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414"&gt;X post&lt;/a&gt; that “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YSEHXBJ65NAAROTKVOXIKR3KGM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hours later in a separate X post, he went on to praise the work of two local doctors who have criticized measles vaccination, and their treatment of measles patients with unproven therapies — budesonide and clarithromycin. Neither has &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-budesonide-and-clarithromycin-unproven-and-risky/?srsltid=AfmBOop53YvHFGlaqvrj5SAVXnYgtlaVL2r9AKtEJxaAEnJyWBmT813X"&gt;been proved effective&lt;/a&gt; as measles treatments and both could have serious side effects, medical experts have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HLMMGFWGZREHVIUZ276JKKSVJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The media “don’t notice how he de-emphasizes [vaccination] by just burying it in with a bunch of the other stuff about vitamin A, steroids, better diet, etc.,” said David Gorski, managing editor of Science-Based Medicine, a website run primarily by physicians that debunks medical misinformation. “It’s like they’ve learned nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TSMSAQVLRNHIXOK2FGKROR3X7M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Between those two statements, Kennedy drew headlines that portrayed him as a supporter of vaccines, including “Kennedy announces support for measles vaccine amid outbreak” in &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/06/kennedy-support-measles-vaccine-outbreak-00276021"&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt; and “RFK Jr. makes new push for vaccine after 2nd child dies of measles” on &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/video/rfk-jr-vaccine-is-most-effective-way-to-prevent-measles-spread-236693061564"&gt;Today.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HATBXVY8111NK1C3DZMD55JEW0" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/10/rfk-jr-personal-responsibility-health-care-donuts-smoking/"&gt;CBS News interview&lt;/a&gt; released a few days later, Kennedy received similar coverage. An initial clip highlighted Kennedy saying he “&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-measles-vaccine/"&gt;encourages&lt;/a&gt;” vaccination — but &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-measles-vaccine/"&gt;left out the context&lt;/a&gt; of his saying he was unsure whether the second child’s death was due to measles. Kennedy also falsely stated again that vaccines are not properly safety-tested, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/11/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing-concerns/?itid=ap_laurenweber_5"&gt;a claim he has made repeatedly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZIMALSZAPRESPJAG4OELH4FCYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the interview with McGraw, better known as Dr. Phil, Kennedy claimed that one of his top three priorities is “making sure the vaccines are safe.” He said, erroneously, that the mumps portion and the combination MMR vaccine were never safety-tested. Medical experts said the MMR vaccine has been monitored for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6QEP6HISXFFTXPWK4PWZIAQIHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In response to questions about these claims, HHS said Kennedy would &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing/"&gt;institute placebo testing&lt;/a&gt; for all “new vaccines,” but it did not fully clarify what that would mean. Medical experts say if that form of testing is applied to already approved vaccines, it could be unethical in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4GHCOHQEI5GVXG2NQSJXTQL6RI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kennedy also told an audience member he’s looking into whether children develop autism after they receive the MMR vaccine — a link that has been thoroughly debunked. More than a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2275444"&gt;dozen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa021134"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; in peer-reviewed top journals in recent decades have rejected this link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X38NGWRVTX5P95RHQ6BRZZ6ZB4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When Kennedy talks, he “mixes a blend of fact and fiction, and since he is the highest health official in the country, that’s dangerous,” said Tom Frieden, CDC director under President Barack Obama and president and chief executive of the nonprofit Resolve to Save Lives. “Health advice is best provided by doctors who are deeply experienced with the facts about vaccines, and anything that undermines trust in measles and other vaccines undermines the health and safety of our kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TUWUSPZNEZHGZHICHVJVCGML2I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When it comes to news about measles, Kennedy allies have released information to develop a narrative around the illness before others can debunk it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QG43PPTXGZAWZACGM674PHOTHY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On April 5, controversial scientist Robert Malone &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/16/texas-measles-misinformation-vaccines/"&gt;was the first&lt;/a&gt; to write that “Another Texas Child Dies a Tragic Death After Recovering from Measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NL3JMDE33VHWVLB2SO74QZUP6A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;According to Malone, medical mismanagement was to blame. In a Substack post to his hundreds of thousands of followers, Malone said he wrote after hearing from a physician he said had knowledge of the child’s care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6BSZ5EDA4FHIRFJBPJPZ7Y6RMY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The press was amplifying the measles outbreak for the “political purposes” of smearing Kennedy, Malone told The Post. Malone previously sued The Post, alleging defamation over the newspaper’s reporting on his advocacy against the coronavirus vaccine. The case was dismissed in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J5G23AEH2BGYLLAFT7MAP5Y7DQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A day after Malone’s Substack account, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported the “&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;second measles death&lt;/a&gt;” in a “school-aged child who tested positive for measles.” The child died of what “doctors described as measles pulmonary failure.

He took note that the phrase came in the third paragraph of a long post. And he said the post on X was edited to add language suggesting the measles outbreak was “flattening,” which independent fact-checkers and experts have said is misleading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LV75IZ5C4JEYFNMG2NMQ5GFMCI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Spencer interpreted the message and its revision as an attempt to speak to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-f-kennedy-measles-vaccine-rhetoric-19552867102b19e6df3ff14ed5030263"&gt;two audiences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CADUOG56YFA65NKRQ4BCJ2GISA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If you look at all the replies, it was a mix of basically, ‘Look, he says vaccines are really important’ and ‘Oh, my God, I can’t believe you are betraying us,’” Spencer said. “It was fascinating to see how people saw this moment different.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6DIZEXCA2VDSFDDOWVK5QJ6Z4Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Children’s Health Defense, Kennedy’s former organization, also has published information about the ongoing measles outbreak.
