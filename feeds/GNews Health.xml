			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt;Ten million people&lt;/a&gt; are diagnosed with dementia worldwide each year – that's more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-us/news-and-media/facts-media"&gt;According to the Alzheimer's Society&lt;/a&gt; approximately one million people in the UK are currently living with the disease. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-91178-7"&gt;Studies predict&lt;/a&gt; this figure will rise to 1.6 million people by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="155248" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease is the &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/alzheimers-disease"&gt;most common cause of dementia&lt;/a&gt; and leads to a decline in memory and thinking skills. This is a &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/alzheimers-disease"&gt;physical illness&lt;/a&gt; that causes the brain to stop working properly and &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers"&gt;gets worse&lt;/a&gt; over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying the onset of Alzheimer's early can help patients and caregivers find the right support and medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to detect Alzheimer's early is by spotting &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26484921/"&gt;changes to&lt;/a&gt; people's &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09919"&gt;use of language&lt;/a&gt;. This is because &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24142144/"&gt;new speech problems&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-160507"&gt;one of the first signs&lt;/a&gt; of a mental decline that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16193251/"&gt;could indicate the onset&lt;/a&gt; of this disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are five early, speech-related signs of Alzheimer's disease to look out for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Pauses, hesitations, and vagueness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most recognisable symptoms of Alzheimer's disease is trouble remembering specific words, which can often lead to frequent or long &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-201584"&gt;pauses and hesitations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a person with Alzheimer's is struggling to remember a word, they may talk vaguely such as saying "thing", or describing and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4462568/"&gt;talking around a word&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if someone is having trouble remembering the word dog, they may say something like "people have them as pets … they bark … I used to have one when I was a child".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xXKj3e6ug4w?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Using words with the wrong meaning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trouble remembering the right word can be an early feature of Alzheimer's. People with Alzheimer's might &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-12313-008"&gt;replace a word&lt;/a&gt; they are trying to say with something related to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, instead of saying "dog", they might use an animal from the same category, saying "cat" for instance. In the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, however, these changes are more likely to be related to a broader or more general category such as saying "animal" instead of "cat".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Talking about a task rather than doing it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone with Alzheimer's may struggle with completing tasks. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1460-6984.12444"&gt;Instead of performing a task&lt;/a&gt;, they may talk about their feelings toward the task, express doubts, or mention past abilities. They might say, "I'm not sure I can do this" or "I used to be good at this", rather than &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-201584"&gt;discussing the task&lt;/a&gt; directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145448" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642.jpg" alt="An older woman with grey hair and glasses, talking on the phone" class="size-full wp-image-145448" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642-603x415.jpg 603w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642-600x413.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145448" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Trouble remembering the right word can be an early feature of Alzheimer's. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MACBY2f2Dks/"&gt;Rido/Canva)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Less word variety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more subtle indicator of Alzheimer's disease is the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24142144/"&gt;tendency to use&lt;/a&gt; simpler language, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-201584"&gt;relying on common words&lt;/a&gt;. People with Alzheimer's often repeat the same verbs, nouns and adjectives &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5137196/"&gt;instead of using a broader vocabulary&lt;/a&gt;. They can also use "the", "and" or "but" frequently to connect sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Difficulty finding the right words&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with Alzheimer's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393204000296"&gt;can have trouble&lt;/a&gt; thinking of words, objects or things that belong in a group. This is sometimes used as a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5929311/"&gt;cognitive test&lt;/a&gt; for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, those with Alzheimer's may struggle to name things in a specific category, such as different foods, different parts of the body or words that start with the same letter. This gets harder as the disease progresses, making these tasks increasingly challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T-BfOEfGWEI?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age is the biggest risk factor for developing Alzheimer's – the chance of developing the disease &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/alzheimers-disease"&gt;doubles every five years&lt;/a&gt; after the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/alzheimers-disease/causes/"&gt;one in 20 people&lt;/a&gt; diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease are under the age of 65. This is referred to as younger – or early-onset Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While forgetting words now and then is normal, persistent and worsening problems remembering words, speaking fluently, or using a variety of words could be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying these signs early can be particularly important for people at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease as they age, such as &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/alzheimers-disease-people-down-syndrome"&gt;people with Down Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/252251/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ars Technica has reached out to the NIH and HHS for comment and will update this story with any new information provided. The agencies did not respond to comment requests from KFF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kennedy’s misinformation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before becoming the top health official in America, Kennedy had long railed against vaccines, becoming one of the world's most prominent anti-vaccine advocates and most prolific spreaders of misinformation and disinformation about vaccines. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/robert-f-kennedy-jr-is-the-single-leading-source-of-anti-vax-ads-on-facebook/"&gt;A 2019 study&lt;/a&gt; found Kennedy was the single leading source of anti-vaccine ads on Facebook. Kennedy subsequently faced bans from &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/09/claims-that-vaccines-are-used-to-track-people-will-now-result-in-youtube-bans/"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/rfk-jrs-anti-vaccine-group-kicked-instagram-facebook-rcna43830"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/02/top-anti-vaxxer-robert-f-kennedy-jr-banned-from-instagram-but-not-facebook/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; for spreading misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers directly blame Kennedy and the Trump administration for the attack on vaccine research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Kennedy’s war on vaccines has started," the mRNA vaccine researcher in Philadelphia told KFF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There will not be any research funded by NIH on mRNA vaccines," the scientist in New York similar told the outlet. "MAGA people are convinced that these vaccines have killed and maimed tens of thousands of people. It’s not true, but they believe that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has made various statements against vaccines generally, as well as mRNA vaccines specifically. He falsely claimed the vaccine causes severe harms, including causing neurodegenerative diseases, &lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1482157837354737668"&gt;such as Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;. In 2021, during the height of the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/petition.pdf"&gt;Kennedy petitioned the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; to revoke the authorization of COVID-19 vaccines and refrain from approving any future COVID-19 vaccines. A study in 2022, meanwhile, estimated that the vaccines had &lt;a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/two-years-covid-vaccines-prevented-millions-deaths-hospitalizations"&gt;saved more than 3 million lives&lt;/a&gt; and prevented more than 18 million hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NIH's recent moves aren't the first sign that Kennedy will use his powerful position to attack mRNA vaccines. Late last month, Bloomberg reported that HHS was considering canceling a &lt;a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Announces-Updates-on-Pandemic-Influenza-Program/default.aspx"&gt;$590 million grant to vaccine maker Moderna&lt;/a&gt; to develop &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/trump-team-weighs-pulling-funding-for-moderna-bird-flu-vaccine"&gt;mRNA vaccines against potential pandemic influenza&lt;/a&gt; viruses. That includes the H5N1 virus that is currently devastating US poultry and spreading wildly in dairy cows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An HHS spokesperson told media at the time that "While it is crucial that the US Department and Health and Human Services support pandemic preparedness, four years of the Biden administration’s failed oversight have made it necessary to review agreements for vaccine production."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear what is happening with that grant review. Moderna declined to comment when Ars reached out for any potential updates Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mississippi state and federal officials have confirmed an outbreak of a strain of bird flu not reported in the U.S. since 2017, with quarantine and depopulation efforts already underway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a statement released March 12, the Mississippi Board of Animal Health stated that poultry from a commercial broiler breeder chicken flock in Noxubee County had tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“The State Veterinarian has quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the property have been depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flock have not entered the food system,” the board stated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Greg Flynn, spokesperson for the Mississippi State Department of Health, confirmed to The Hill that his department was aware of the outbreak and that no human cases have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) under the Department of Agriculture confirmed the outbreak was linked to the H7N9 strain, marking the first outbreak of this strain occurring in commercial poultry in the U.S. since 2017. The APHIS noted this outbreak is unrelated to the H5N1 bird flu outbreaks currently impacting commercial flocks in other parts of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The flock of roughly 46,000 birds was experiencing high mortality, and samples tested at the Mississippi Veterinary Research &amp;amp; Diagnostic Laboratory, a member of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, were presumptive positive for HPAI then confirmed at APHIS’ National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL),” the agency stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Both the Mississippi Board of Animal Health and the APHIS said the risk to the public remains low as the virus is not a food safety risk when eggs and poultry are properly handled and cooked. The Mississippi board called on home poultry owners to practice “good biosecurity” and to be aware of signs of bird flu symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early-life adversity affects more than half of the world's children and is a significant risk factor for cognitive and mental health problems later in life. In an extensive and up-to-the-minute review of research in this domain, scholars from the University of California, Irvine illuminate the profound impacts of these adverse childhood experiences on brain development and introduce new paths for understanding and tackling them.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Their study, &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0896627325001345" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Neuron&lt;/i&gt;, examines the mechanisms behind the long-term consequences of childhood &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adversity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;adversity&lt;/a&gt;). Despite extensive research spanning over seven decades, the authors point out that significant questions remain unanswered. For example, how do adults—from parents to researchers—fully comprehend what is perceived as stressful by an infant or child?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such conceptual queries, as well as the use of cutting-edge research tools, can provide a road map, guiding experts toward developing innovative methods and providing solutions to this pressing mental health issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our research suggests that the unpredictability of a child's early environment may be just as important as more traditionally recognized forms of adversity, such as abuse or neglect," said lead author Dr. Tallie Z. Baram, Donald Bren Professor of Pediatrics. "Our review has important implications for how we approach &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/early+intervention/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;early intervention&lt;/a&gt; and prevention strategies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She and co-author Matthew Birnie, a UC Irvine postdoctoral scholar, identify several key areas for further investigation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the developing brain perceive as stressful?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which aspects of stress most significantly influence brain maturation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which developmental ages are most vulnerable to adversity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the molecular mediators of stress effects on the brain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can transient stressful experiences lead to enduring dysfunction?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;One notable discovery is a novel form of early-life stress: unpredictable sensory inputs from caregivers and the environment. This factor plays a substantial role in adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, even after controlling for well-known adverse childhood experiences, which are collectively referred to as ACEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review highlights the limitations of current ACE scoring systems in accurately predicting individual outcomes and underscores the complexity of early-life stress. Emerging factors, such as societal and anthropogenic characteristics like inequality and pollution, are gaining recognition as potential contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal models have been instrumental in unraveling the mechanisms underlying brain development effects. Research has revealed that different types of stress can yield distinct outcomes, influenced by the nature and timing of stress, as well as species, strain and sex variations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/molecular+level/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;molecular level&lt;/a&gt;, early-life stress can substantially alter neuronal gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. These changes may lead to long-term modifications in how the brain responds to subsequent experiences. At the circuit level, early stress can disrupt the maturation of brain networks by interfering with crucial developmental processes, including neuronal oscillations and synaptic pruning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're gradually comprehending how early-life stress can 'reprogram' the brain at multiple levels, from individual molecules to entire neural circuits. This knowledge presents new avenues for targeted interventions," Baram said.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;The review also identifies key molecular mediators of early-life stress effects, including glucocorticoids and neuropeptides like corticotropin-releasing hormones. Ongoing research is uncovering novel roles for these molecules in specific neural circuits affected by early stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of these findings, the researchers propose redefining early-life stress as "early-life adversity" to better encompass the diverse experiences that can impact &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+development/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain development&lt;/a&gt;, even those not traditionally perceived as stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This review emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive understanding of early-life adversity," Baram said. "By focusing on how the developing brain processes and responds to these experiences, we can develop more effective strategies to prevent and mitigate their long-term effects."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest increased funding for and attention to this critical area of study, highlighting its potential to enhance mental health outcomes and reduce the societal burden of early-life adversity.&lt;/p&gt;

Schools went online. Offices went remote. People followed a 6-foot rule as they searched mostly empty grocery shelves for toilet paper and hand sanitizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the growing coronavirus pandemic, the region’s public health officials announced &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/16/coronavirus-six-bay-area-counties-to-shelter-in-place/"&gt;an expansive and unprecedented shelter-in-place order&lt;/a&gt; on March 16, 2020. Life changed in an instant and in unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/03/16/covid-shutdown-bay-area-anniversary-public-health/"&gt;On 5th anniversary of COVID shutdown, Bay Area public health officers reflect on fray between life, liberty&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years later, much has returned to pre-pandemic normals. But not completely. In ways big and small, Bay Area residents are still coping with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Monthly total deaths have settled, but still higher than pre-pandemic normal&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early shutdown in the Bay Area and California is often credited with the region’s lower-than-average COVID death rates. Still, over the last five years, the death certificates of more than 110,000 California residents list COVID as the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mortality patterns have not quite returned to normal. California’s death totals from all causes have remained above the 2016-2019 average each month since 2020, sometimes much higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before 2020, influenza was the only infectious disease that caused notable fluctuations in death totals. But starting in early 2020, COVID changed the baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deadliest month in the years before the pandemic was January 2018, during a bad flu season, when 28,400 people died in the state. But a jaw-dropping 48,000 died in January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID deaths alone do not account for the entire increase, though it does explain a large portion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The health care system has been profoundly perturbed by the pandemic,” said John Swartzberg, clinical professor emeritus at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“COVID caused a lot of premature deaths from heart attacks,” Swartzberg said. “Also the disruption had effects on the populace that were deleterious to its health: increased alcohol consumption, decreased activity, depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Unemployment rate returned to pre-pandemic levels after two years&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of unemployed California residents remained steady, around 4%, in the two years leading up to the pandemic, but jumped to over 16% by April 2020, when pandemic shutdowns and disruptions caused so many people to lose their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took a little more than two years, but by the summer of 2022 unemployment rates were back around 4%. Since then, the rate has been steadily increasing, reaching 5.5% in December 2024, up from the post-pandemic low of 3.8% in August 2022, though unemployment rates don’t tell the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Rise of working from home has profoundly changed transportation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ridership on BART plummeted when the shelter-in-place orders were issued, from an average weekday ridership of around 400,000 in 2019 to just 25,000 in April 2020. But while many people have returned to their offices, BART ridership was about 163,000 in January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“BART ridership has hovered around 40% of pre-pandemic volume” said Abby Raisz, research director at the Bay Area Council Economic Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of people crossing the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge dropped by about half in April 2020 but mostly recovered after the first 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Generally speaking, since late 2020, like the Bay Bridge traffic volumes have been … around 90% of what they were pre-pandemic,” Raisz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;California students are still trying to catch up&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the pandemic shutdown started, students were sent home and spent months in virtual classrooms, where many struggled to keep up. And the proof is in the test scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The percent of California students who met or exceeded standards for English language and mathematics testing had been on a slightly positive trajectory in the years leading up to the 2018-19 school year, with just over 51% of students meeting language expectations that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now just 47% of students meet those standards for language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Math aptitude has always trended lower but was also on a positive trajectory through the 2018-19 school year when about 40% of students met or exceeded the standard. Now, 35.5% of students in the Golden State met the standard for math last year, still well shy of pre-pandemic levels despite slight gains in the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;California’s population is growing again after two years of big exodus drops&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID impacted California’s population profoundly — hundreds of thousands moved out of the state in the first two years of the pandemic, a trend referred to as the exodus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The causes for the California exodus, which was even more pronounced in the Bay Area, has been hotly debated. Many point to the extra-strict pandemic regulations imposed by public health officials locally and statewide, and the high and rapidly increasing cost of living is often cited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest updates show that California is back to year-over-year population growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Bay Area, “foreign immigration is back to a level that we hadn’t really seen since around 2019,” Raisz said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent most of my twenties locked in an all-out war with my skin, and I lost every battle. You name an &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/best-acne-skincare-products-review/"&gt;acne treatment&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ve &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/shopping/best-beef-tallow-skincare-products-review/"&gt;slathered&lt;/a&gt; it on my face with reckless optimism and abandon. Retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid — I layered them like a chemist, convinced I was one product away from finally having the poreless, glowing skin everyone around me seemed to have. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, I got perioral dermatitis: a cruel, red, flaky rash around my mouth that pleaded, &lt;em&gt;Quit attacking your face&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;you dip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After many frantic Google searches and an emergency dermatologist visit (where I was gently but explicitly told to “calm down”), I realized my skin barrier was holding on by a thread, and my hormonal acne wasn’t going to be bullied into submission with another round of spot treatments. I needed a different approach — one that didn’t involve me staring into the mirror every morning, whispering, &lt;em&gt;What fresh hell is this?&lt;/em&gt; That’s when I stumbled across &lt;a data-nyp-link-source="trackonomics" data-nyp-affiliate="true" href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/nypost_01638_nypost?p=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2Fshopping%2Fclearstem-supplement-skincare-review%2F&amp;amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fclearstem-skincare.sjv.io%2Fc%2F2229206%2F1126133%2F14265%3FsubId1%3Dnyp-RW-TXL-clearstemreview%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fclearstem.com%2Fproducts%2Fmindbodyskin-hormonal-acne-supplement-no-5-htp&amp;amp;author=Kendall%20Cornish&amp;amp;articleID=35304913&amp;amp;event_type=click&amp;amp;publishdate=march%2017%2C%202025&amp;amp;linksource=web&amp;amp;primarytag=skincare&amp;amp;contentsection=shopping" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;CLEARSTEM MINDBODYSKIN&lt;/a&gt;, a supplement designed to tackle hormonal acne from the inside out.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My review&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;em&gt; Jump scare warning!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I was skeptical. I’ve taken enough “acne-fighting” supplements in my day to know that most of them just give you expensive pee. But the CLEARSTEM reviews were great, the founder story felt genuinely skin-nerd passionate, and there weren’t any toxic fillers or mystery ingredients in sight. Plus, my skin was already at rock bottom, so I figured since it’s not a topical chemical, what did I have to lose&lt;em&gt;?&lt;/em&gt; Here’s how it went.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started taking &lt;a href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2Fpage%2FB8E79071-99A6-42FF-A569-A263902CE172%3Ftag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2Fshopping%2Fclearstem-supplement-skincare-review%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;MINDBODYSKIN&lt;/a&gt; with the cautious optimism of a woman who has quite literally been burned before. My hormonal acne tends to flare up around my jawline, and after years of wrecking my skin barrier with topical, over-the-counter treatments, I needed something that would get to the root of the issue without sending me into another perioral dermatitis flare-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within two weeks, my skin was noticeably calmer. No new cystic breakouts, no dramatic flare-ups, just steady skin. By week four, I had an almost shocking realization one day when I was applying my makeup: my skin was actually clear. Like, no, “this side of my face is fine, but don’t look at my jawline,” clear. Just…&lt;em&gt;clear&lt;/em&gt;-clear. I have never in my life found a product that actually cleared my skin in under a month. It has been four weeks of testing this product, having purchased it myself and fully expecting it to be another &lt;em&gt;meh&lt;/em&gt; addition to my routine. Instead, it did what years of prescriptions, topicals, birth control, and dietary changes failed to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biggest difference? My usual PMS breakout never showed up. Normally, either side of my chin would be a disaster zone the week before my period, but this time? Nothing. My skin wasn’t just behaving…it was thriving. The redness from old breakouts faded, and my skin looked smoother and less inflamed overall. The best part? No new or continued perioral dermatitis flare-ups. This is huge for me because so many acne treatments send my skin straight into a full-blown bumpy, red rash. But with MINDBODYSKIN, my skin got clearer without any reactions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And when I say no reactions, I mean no reactions. It’s a supplement, so with my luck, I half expected that even if it were to clear my skin it would probably also wreck my stomach, mind, weight…something. Nope. I physically feel better: more energy, more optimism, more clarity. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are two types of MINDBODYSKIN: one with 5-HTP (a dietary supplement that raises serotonin levels in the brain) and one without it. I opted for the one without it since I’m already taking an SSRI, and I still got noticeably great mood affects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The verdict&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call it a side-effect of clear skin, but I frankly don’t care what it is. I love this stuff and, better still, it loves me. Would I repurchase? Absolutely. In fact, I’m committing to taking it for another two months to reinforce the effects and make sure this isn’t some kind of skincare placebo dream.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually cleared my skin in under a month (first product to ever do this)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;br&gt;Balances hormones naturally&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contains anti-inflammatory and stress-reducing ingredients&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Supports gut health (a.k.a. fewer surprise breakouts from “mystery foods”)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;No sketchy fillers, artificial dyes, or hormone disruptors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doesn’t dry out or irritate skin like topical treatments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Takes time to see results (not an overnight miracle)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Can cause an initial “purge” phase&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Pricey ($58.00 per bottle)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Requires consistency — no skipping doses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MINDBODYSKIN is an anti-acne supplement designed to support hormonal balance, gut health, and skin clarity, all without the harsh side effects of prescription medications. It contains key ingredients like DIM (Diindolylmethane), vitamin B5, turmeric, and ashwagandha, all chosen for their ability to reduce excess androgens, calm inflammation, and support the body’s natural detoxification process. Unlike traditional acne treatments, which attack the skin from the outside, this one takes an inside-out approach, focusing on balancing the hormones and deficiencies that often trigger breakouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;FAQs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is CLEARSTEM MINDBODYSKIN?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CLEARSTEM MINDBODYSKIN is an anti-acne, hormone-balancing supplement designed to target breakouts from the inside out. Instead of harsh topical treatments that dry out the skin or prescription medications with heavy side effects, this supplement works by regulating hormones, reducing inflammation, and supporting gut health — three major causes of persistent acne.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It contains a blend of science-backed, natural ingredients that help clear skin, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DIM (Diindolylmethane)&lt;/strong&gt; – Regulates estrogen and testosterone levels to prevent hormonal breakouts&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid)&lt;/strong&gt; – Reduces excess oil production&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turmeric &amp;amp; ALA (Alpha Lipoic Acid)&lt;/strong&gt; – Anti-inflammatory powerhouses that calm redness and irritation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashwagandha&lt;/strong&gt; – Lowers cortisol levels (stress = breakouts)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bioavailable Zinc &amp;amp; Selenium&lt;/strong&gt; – Supports skin healing and immune function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MINDBODYSKIN is gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, and non-toxic, making it a clean, holistic alternative to traditional acne treatments. It’s designed for people dealing with hormonal acne, adult acne, or inflammation-related breakouts, especially those who want a long-term, sustainable solution without harsh side effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is CLEARSTEM for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

It’s particularly great for those who:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have cyclical, hormonal breakouts (especially around the jawline or chin)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Have tried topical treatments without success&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Struggle with gut health issues that contribute to skin problems&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Want a non-toxic, hormone-balancing approach to acne&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long does it take CLEARSTEM to work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most users start seeing initial improvements within 2-4 weeks, with skin looking calmer and breakouts reducing in frequency. Full results typically take 8-12 weeks, as the body adjusts to the hormonal balancing and anti-inflammatory effects. Some people may experience an initial purge phase in the first few weeks as toxins and excess hormones are flushed out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I need a prescription for CLEARSTEM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No, CLEARSTEM MINDBODYSKIN does not require a prescription. It’s an over-the-counter supplement made with all-natural, science-backed ingredients that support hormonal and skin health. However, if you’re on prescription medications for acne or hormonal conditions, it’s always a good idea to check with your doctor before starting a new supplement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much does CLEARSTEM cost?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The body you inhabit is made up of lots of moving parts that need to communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of this communication – in the nervous system, for example – takes the form of bioelectrical signals that propagate through the body to trigger the appropriate response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, US researchers have discovered that the epithelial cells that line our skin and organs are able to signal the same way to communicate peril. They just use a long, slow 'scream', rather than the rapid-fire communication of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a huge surprise, since these cells had been previously considered 'mute' – and may open new avenues for electrical medical devices to accelerate healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Epithelial cells do things that no one has ever thought to look for," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076752"&gt;says polymath Steve Granick&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. "When injured, they 'scream' to their neighbors, slowly, persistently, and over surprising distances. It's like a nerve's impulse, but 1,000 times slower."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155087" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155087" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/keratinocytes.jpg" alt="For The First Time, We've Heard The Slow, Silent Scream of Human Skin" class="size-full wp-image-155087" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/keratinocytes.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/keratinocytes-440x415.jpg 440w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/keratinocytes-600x566.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155087" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The team's research involved using a laser to wound (white dots) a single layer of skin cells, using electrodes (black circles) to detect the signals. (Steve Granick)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-observe-cells-in-the-body-working-like-computer-circuit-boards"&gt;body's communication networks&lt;/a&gt; keep it functioning. You'll whip your hand off a hot surface &lt;em&gt;tout de suite&lt;/em&gt; without even thinking about it; that's your nervous system at work. Your heart's pumping action is &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21648-heart-conduction-system"&gt;regulated via electrical signals&lt;/a&gt;; the discovery of this enabled the invention of the artificial pacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granick and his colleague, biomedical engineer Sun-Min Yu of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, designed a system to investigate cellular communication in the epithelium. Their system consisted of a chip connected to an array of around 60 electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chip was coated with a single layer of lab-grown human keratinocytes, the main epithelial cells that make up the epidermis, the outer layer of skin. With a laser, the researchers "stung" the skin layer, using the electrode array to listen in to the electrical shifts that followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We tracked how cells coordinated their response," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076752"&gt;Yu says&lt;/a&gt;. "It's a slow-motion, excited conversation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting signals propagated at speeds of around 10 millimeters per second, across quite large distances up to hundreds of micrometers from the site of the wound. It seems not dissimilar to the electrical calcium signaling observed in plants when &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/plant-damage-response-defence-calcium-ions-glutamate-fluorescent"&gt;damaged by a hungry, hungry caterpillar&lt;/a&gt;, as seen in the video below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lzq-wRHCTKc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This &lt;/span&gt;communication, the researchers observed, relied heavily on ion channels, small pores in cell membranes that allow the transport of charged ions, predominantly calcium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, these &lt;span&gt;epithelial-cell&lt;/span&gt; ion channels respond to a mechanical stimulus, such as pressure or stretching, which is slightly different from the ion channels of neurons, which respond to changes in voltage or chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The epithelial signals last much longer than neuronal signals, too, with some "conversations" recorded for up to five hours, according to the researchers. However, the voltage was of a similar amplitude to that observed in neurons, and the communication cycled through the phases that neuronal communication does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because this is only a newly discovered phenomenon, more work needs to be conducted to understand how it works, and the different contributing factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't know for sure what the cells are using for the signal, or if different &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22062-epithelium"&gt;kinds of epithelial cells&lt;/a&gt; are operating differently when it comes to communicating harm, though initial tests suggest calcium ions are involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the discovery&lt;/span&gt; hints at new possibilities for biomedical devices, like wearable sensors and electronic bandages that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-use-electricity-to-make-wounds-heal-3x-faster"&gt;accelerate wound healing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Understanding these screams between wounded cells opens doors we didn't know existed," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076752"&gt;Yu says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2427123122"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

By the time you reach your 60s, you’re almost certain to need treatment for tooth decay. Figuring out exactly what dental care you need and when can be challenging.

Some people will need to visit more often than the standard twice a year, while others may be fine with less frequent visits. A &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004346.pub5/full" target="_blank"&gt;2020 review by Cochrane&lt;/a&gt;, an independent group of expert researchers, found that adults who visited the dentist every six months and those who visited on a schedule customized to their individual dental risk had comparable oral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YT4YLNYPLVGWNAJIHGLJTK6QLA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;People who are being treated for periodontal disease or who have dental implants — which can fail more quickly than a natural tooth — may need to see their provider every three months or so, says Martha McComas, a clinical associate professor of dentistry at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry in Ann Arbor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N7LCDILVEFHBFD4JRCRH6IHLHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Your dentist can help you figure out the right cadence for checkups, as well as your optimal at-home dental care strategy. “We can customize it based on what we see in your mouth,” says Karin Arsenault, program director of geriatric dentistry at the Tufts University School of Dental Medicine in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4MUHYP2L4JEMTCZCMUW4EZODUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Between visits, here’s what you need to know about the vital tools for keeping your teeth and your whole mouth as healthy as they can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="MVTVEIWAPBBKTKB34DYVZMA7H4" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="MVTVEIWAPBBKTKB34DYVZMA7H4"&gt;Your toothpaste matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HRI4FF7XEBB4TN765ZATBSOIUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Fluoride is important. Fluoride is crucial because of the power it has to help fight cavities and tooth decay — something proved by decades of research. While some ingredients, notably a chemical called hydroxyapatite, have shown promise as viable alternatives, fluoride is still your best choice right now, according to the American Dental Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TAOXEKFBAFBEXKLRQMHSXQPSZE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Cavities occur when the bacteria in our mouths consume the traces of food left on our teeth, particularly anything sugary. As the bacteria gobble up these sugars, they release acid, which can remove minerals from our teeth’s enamel, eventually creating cavities. Fluoride can help replace some of these lost minerals, strengthening the surface of our teeth and repairing some damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RMXMCQKKKVEBHAOIGTX5UORUZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When you’re shopping for toothpaste, look for one with the ADA Seal of Acceptance. To earn that seal, manufacturers need to not only include fluoride in their toothpaste but also meet other safety and efficacy standards, including one meant to ensure toothpastes aren’t too abrasive. (Very abrasive toothpastes can damage enamel.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MD3AYWC2SFG2JMCQWPC2I6BKSA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Watch out for this ingredient: If you’re prone to canker sores inside your mouth, you may want to look for a toothpaste that doesn’t contain sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). A &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jop.12845" target="_blank"&gt;2019 research review&lt;/a&gt; found that using an SLS-free toothpaste might help reduce canker sores in people who get a lot of them (about 25 percent of adults).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IDGT3CM3KJGSFO4YISQVRITNBU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Skip charcoal toothpaste. Activated charcoal is often touted as a superior ingredient for a variety of products, including toothpaste. But it can be highly abrasive, which research has shown &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/dental-oral-care/does-charcoal-toothpaste-work-a7477277301/" target="_blank"&gt;can damage your enamel and cause increased sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VYUJCP3VONGNJHA4WYVHWG3LCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;How much toothpaste to use: Generally, adults need only a pea-size amount of toothpaste — that will create enough foam to cover all the surfaces in your mouth, Arsenault says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FJKIZZFJ5VCAJHJGUFOYLC6Q6M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Also, “one of the big myths about toothbrushing is that you should rinse your mouth out after you brush,” says McComas. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8896328/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies show that the fluoride in your toothpaste provides the biggest benefit if you don’t do this&lt;/a&gt;, instead allowing the fluoride to work its magic on your enamel for more time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EGKF7XID4FCRHGOIADURTCRZ64" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What about prescription pastes? You may want to ask your dentist whether a prescription toothpaste, which generally contains a higher dose of fluoride, might be right for you. Severe dry mouth, which can be more common as you age (particularly if you’re taking certain medications for various chronic conditions, including for high blood pressure and depression), can raise your risk of cavities. So can periodontal disease, especially if the surfaces of the roots of your teeth, which lack protective enamel, are exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="HCDUXKCQQNBADLSO53HEZLF3MQ" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="HCDUXKCQQNBADLSO53HEZLF3MQ"&gt;How to brush well&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HVJ7ZTQXQNAGNDWM3VXLZUDWSQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The right bristles: Use a toothbrush with soft or extra-soft bristles. There are so many toothbrush options, but in the midst of considering the shape of the brush head, the brand name and other fancy features, don’t lose sight of bristle stiffness. Seek out a toothbrush with “soft” or “extra soft” on the packaging. Stiffer bristles are more likely to damage your gums or your teeth’s enamel, according to the American Dental Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IT4MZEUCZZBBJI54XKOUSU5SOY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The advantages of an electric toothbrush: You can keep your mouth perfectly healthy with a manual toothbrush, but a &lt;a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD002281/ORAL_poweredelectric-toothbrushes-compared-to-manual-toothbrushes-for-maintaining-oral-health" target="_blank"&gt;2014 Cochrane review&lt;/a&gt; found that three months of using an electric toothbrush resulted in 21 percent less plaque and 11 percent less gum inflammation (also called gingivitis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZTW7JNRRHNBTLOGUCKWBPPCRYI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/toothbrushes/is-a-sonic-or-a-rotating-electric-toothbrush-better-a1107158095/" target="_blank"&gt;not significant performance differences&lt;/a&gt; between oscillating (or rotating) electric toothbrushes, which typically have round heads, and sonic toothbrushes, which usually have rectangular heads.

Some research suggests that people may brush for a lot less time than this on average, possibly around a minute or less. But common sense and a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19723429/" target="_blank"&gt;2009 Journal of Dental Hygiene study&lt;/a&gt; suggest that brushing longer will remove more plaque — though the added benefit of extra time beyond two minutes is probably marginal, and brushing too hard can exacerbate problems, including receding gums, which can expose the roots of your teeth to a greater risk of cavities and tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="BDAE2VS4PNFJDDQ5TP2I4JT5GY" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="BDAE2VS4PNFJDDQ5TP2I4JT5GY"&gt;How to floss&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FFIKPGFC7ZDETAMZOPE6XW7O3A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Why flossing matters: Use any standard string floss (waxed or unwaxed), floss pick or interdental cleaning brush. The scientific evidence for flossing is not as strong as it is for brushing: A 2019 Cochrane review found that flossing in addition to brushing may reduce plaque and gingivitis more than brushing alone, but the authors cautioned that the evidence supporting this conclusion was weak. Still, dentists say the biological justification for flossing is sound: Without it, the bacteria that cause decay can build up between your teeth even if you’re brushing regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7EEIITIXH5EHZI4X5SIB5KRD24" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Do water flossers work? While not quite as effective as string floss, water flossers can be a great option if you have a hard time using string floss, have mouth hardware like braces or a permanent retainer, or have other kinds of dental work like implants, bridges, or crowns. Dentist Sally Cram, a spokeswoman  for the American Dental Association, says the evidence on the benefits of a water flosser is encouraging, but it’s not enough for her to recommend it as a replacement for flossing just yet. Still, if you know you won’t use string floss every day, a water flosser is better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VMAVHRF44ZFBBD47KAAVWB4UYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Avoid floss with PFAS. Skip floss that’s coated with these environmental contaminants, which are associated with a variety of health problems. You can look for flosses that use non-PFAS coatings such as beeswax or plant waxes like carnauba or candelilla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U6YB4NTPYBEY7FAM2OGL3EOPA4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;CR partnered with Made Safe, an independent organization that certifies products as safer and more sustainable, to find flosses made without PFAS.

Do it once a day.

If you have an implant, you may want to opt for an interdental brush instead of regular string floss, particularly if your implant doesn’t touch the teeth next to it on either side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H2IOVMRTANEKRLXCRTLHT6CYAE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These are tiny round brushes designed specifically to clean in between teeth, and they work well with teeth that have gaps in between them. They come in different sizes, so Jennifer Harmon, a registered dental hygienist and clinical associate professor at the University of North Carolina Adams School of Dentistry in Chapel Hill, recommends working with your dentist to figure out which size you need for your teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M4IKIW6HLNC5BFSD2I7HUPO56I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’re dealing with bleeding gums, Arsenault says, you can consider using prescription chlorhexidine mouthwash after you floss. Just be sure to follow your dentist’s instructions, because chlorhexidine can also cause some tooth staining and changes in taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="ATEL5BV7MVEF5FJDESNMOQKRXI" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="ATEL5BV7MVEF5FJDESNMOQKRXI"&gt;Do you need these dental tools?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JWTXB4XSTRGXFJOUNPRA5VRVPM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tongue scrapers:&lt;/b&gt; The experts we spoke with say this is a great tool. The bacteria that cause tooth decay don’t just live on your teeth; they can collect on your tongue, too. That means you should clean your tongue daily. You can do this with your toothbrush bristles or the ridged back of some brushes, but a tongue scraper can be a little more effective,  Cram says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BUEAUKTJG5AN7CMYRFBKFWEGN4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Plus, scraping your tongue is a great habit if you struggle with halitosis (bad breath), says Roxanne Dsouza-Norwood, a registered dental hygienist and clinical assistant professor of dental hygiene at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. But be gentle; otherwise you could accidentally lacerate your tongue. And you may need to experiment with different types of tongue scrapers to find one that doesn’t activate your gag reflex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7YITL4TDOVE6TPTYGODOTRW3CI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whitening strips:&lt;/b&gt; Over-the-counter whitening strips can help your teeth look whiter, but it can sometimes be difficult to spot the change,  McComas says. You can try using them only on the upper teeth first so that the difference is more visible. (Then apply them to the lower teeth.) Keep in mind that the older you get, the more you can see the yellowish dentin underneath your enamel, which — along with crowns and implants — is not affected by strips. So you might end up with uneven colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZI3XIH32ERFINLVJ3CHX3PJBFI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Strips can also cause sensitivity, particularly if you already have sensitive areas from gum recession, Cram says. So leave them on only as long as instructed on the package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ALTLSAHZFJFRRPE2J5RFR4UR5A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mouthwash:&lt;/b&gt; Because swishing it around can coat parts of your teeth’s surface that are harder to reach with other tools, mouthwash can be a nice adjunct to your dental care routine, particularly if you choose one that has fluoride. Prescription washes that contain chlorhexidine can also be helpful for people with bleeding gums or other severe gum problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h5 class="wpds-c-vXjlY wpds-c-vXjlY-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" data-apitype="header" level="6" id="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q"&gt;Copyright 2024, Consumer Reports Inc.&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NGIOUE72HRGJHDJS2MZ36HBWDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Consumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer and healthier world.

Researchers found that semaglutide reduced inflammation in the brains of genetically modified mice that mimic Alzheimer’s disease and improved their memory performance. The findings, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2024.11.022" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, add to growing evidence that diabetes medications may offer benefits for neurodegenerative diseases, though more research is needed to understand how these drugs exert their effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide is a medication sold under brand names such as Ozempic and Wegovy, commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. It belongs to a class of drugs known as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, which help regulate blood sugar and appetite. In recent years, scientists have discovered that these drugs may have additional benefits beyond metabolic control, including potential protective effects in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease gradually damages nerve cells in the brain, leading to memory loss and cognitive decline. This deterioration is linked to the buildup of toxic proteins, chronic inflammation, and impaired energy metabolism in brain cells. Some studies suggest that semaglutide may help by reducing brain inflammation and preventing cell damage, but the precise mechanism is not yet fully understood. The new study aimed to investigate how semaglutide affects brain inflammation and memory function in a well-established mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test semaglutide’s effects, the researchers used a well-established mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease known as APP/PS1/tau transgenic mice. These mice carry genetic mutations that cause the buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles, the two main hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. The study also included a group of normal, healthy mice for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice were divided into four groups: a control group of normal mice given a placebo, a group of Alzheimer’s model mice given a placebo, a group of normal mice given semaglutide, and a group of Alzheimer’s model mice treated with semaglutide. The researchers administered semaglutide at a dose of 25 nanomoles per kilogram every other day for 30 days. After the treatment period, the mice underwent behavioral tests to assess their memory and learning abilities. The researchers also examined brain tissue to measure levels of inflammation and amyloid plaque buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that semaglutide improved both short-term and long-term memory in the Alzheimer’s model mice. In a test called the Y-maze, which measures spatial working memory, untreated Alzheimer’s model mice performed significantly worse than normal mice. However, those treated with semaglutide showed improved memory performance, nearly matching the healthy control mice. Similarly, in the Morris water maze, a test that assesses long-term spatial memory, semaglutide-treated mice found the hidden platform more quickly than untreated Alzheimer’s model mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a biological level, semaglutide reduced the amount of amyloid plaque in the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory. The researchers also found that semaglutide lowered levels of inflammatory molecules such as interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which are known to contribute to brain cell damage. At the same time, semaglutide increased levels of anti-inflammatory molecules such as interleukin-4 and interleukin-10, which help protect brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key findings was that semaglutide appeared to change the behavior of microglia, the brain’s immune cells. In Alzheimer’s disease, microglia become overly activated and release harmful inflammatory substances. Semaglutide encouraged microglia to shift from a pro-inflammatory state, known as the M1 type, to an anti-inflammatory state, known as the M2 type. This transformation is thought to reduce brain damage and promote healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further investigate how semaglutide affects inflammation, the researchers conducted additional experiments using cultured microglial cells. When these cells were exposed to amyloid beta, a toxic protein linked to Alzheimer’s, they became inflamed and started releasing harmful substances. However, when the cells were pretreated with semaglutide, they produced fewer inflammatory molecules and were less likely to undergo cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, semaglutide did not appear to increase the number of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors in the brain, which are the drug’s primary target in diabetes treatment. This suggests that semaglutide may enhance the sensitivity of existing receptors rather than increasing their quantity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the findings are promising, the study has several limitations. First, the research was conducted in mice, and it is unclear whether the same effects will be seen in humans. While semaglutide has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier, its precise effects on human brain inflammation and memory remain to be fully tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the study focused primarily on microglia, but other brain cells, such as astrocytes, also play a role in neuroinflammation and may be influenced by semaglutide. Future research should investigate whether semaglutide affects other types of brain cells and how these changes contribute to neuroprotection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, while this study focused on short-term treatment effects, Alzheimer’s disease progresses over many years. Future studies should examine whether long-term semaglutide treatment can slow cognitive decline in aging animals and, ultimately, in people with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide is currently being tested in large-scale clinical trials for Alzheimer’s disease, and if the results are positive, it could become one of the first medications to treat both diabetes and neurodegeneration. These findings add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that drugs designed for metabolic disorders might also hold promise for brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2024.11.022" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Semaglutide promotes the transition of microglia from M1 to M2 type to reduce brain inflammation in APP/PS1/tau mice&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Zhao-Jun Wang, Wei-Na Han, Shi-Fan Chai, Yan Li, Chao-Jing Fu, Chen-Fang Wang, Hong-Yan Cai, Xin-Yi Li, Xiao Wang, Christian Hölscher, and Mei-Na Wu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 18:02:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxObGhiVTBBZUFqMDM4aFVYTW5Qa0J4bGRWWDNRUWtJemkyaTJLdVdaSnZjT3htbEQ5V1kwdUlCNWhuTlFEQ2xPMVR6b05MQTk5Wm5hY3piQUFfUG9TVnpLbnF5Z2h5U0VDM2RKLTZoaUlTM0hWZUtuaFhVel9mMFJZSFZPdkpLWDlCMkU1Tm9ycTlTTHdjSHV5V1dIOXJlU0g4YldxaGtLeFNsQQ</guid></item><item><title>The dangerous side of popular sleep and anxiety drugs like Xanax and Lorazepam - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNMnNmcWR1dURsVzFZTnFZZTFmUV9tMW1sLUhva2FRbldFUVJMWDVwRHdPbVpqZ0NJSzFBWXZ4RlFqTy1pd1JiSS1TLVpaUjBkaEFPQ0ZZQW9IbmpSVXFBZmhQbzNsMmYwdWhubUN5VlRFRFFEM3I3SmN4cklUSTN1ODFaSHdfTTI4RGl0U1BDYW1TTzc2?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-cy="article-image" class="sc-fac7c12f-7 ifTevn"&gt;&lt;img alt="Benzodiazepines are commonly talked about on hit TV shows, but what are the risks?

&lt;p&gt;Investigators working on the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program found out last week that the National Institutes of Health has halted funding for the project. While they have not yet received confirmation from the agency on why the grant has been canceled, the decision appears likely related to the Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/11/columbia-scientists-reel-grant-cancellations-hit-broad-suite-research/"&gt;cancellation&lt;/a&gt; of federal grants to Columbia University on the grounds that it had failed to adequately address antisemitism on campus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since 2022, Columbia has been managing funding for the most recent phase of the program, which is focused on tracking the development of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias among participants. But over 90% of the current funding, which amounts to more than $80 million spanning five years, is ultimately distributed to over two dozen other research sites across the U.S., according to José Luchsinger, a Columbia professor and one of the principal investigators. &lt;/p&gt;

Fortunately, a diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods—especially colorful fruits and vegetables—can help combat excess inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help you navigate the farmers’ market this season, we asked registered dietitians to share their favorite anti-inflammatory foods to buy this spring and delicious ways to enjoy them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Strawberries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring is the peak season for strawberries, which is good news for your health. These juicy red berries are rich in vitamin C, anthocyanins and flavonoids—powerful compounds that help fight inflammation. Research suggests that eating strawberries regularly may support cardiometabolic health and reduce inflammation, particularly in those at higher risk for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you can easily find them at a grocery store, there’s nothing better than picking a fresh, ripe strawberry. “If you have a small garden, strawberries are one of the easiest fruits to grow, thriving in raised beds, containers or even hanging baskets. They come back year after year and require minimal care beyond watering and sun exposure,” says &lt;a href="http://www.nourishandrenewnutrition.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Korrinna Kelly, RDN, LD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Korrinna Kelly, RDN, LD,&lt;/a&gt; founder of Nourish &amp;amp; Renew Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to enjoy:&lt;/strong&gt; Add fresh strawberries to smoothies, yogurt bowls or salads like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/270668/spinach-strawberry-salad-with-feta-walnuts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Spinach-Strawberry Salad with Feta &amp;amp; Walnuts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Spinach-Strawberry Salad with Feta &amp;amp; Walnuts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Asparagus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17129/5-powerful-health-benefits-of-asparagus-you-probably-didnt-know/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Asparagus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Asparagus&lt;/a&gt; is a springtime delicacy loaded with fiber, folate and antioxidants. It also contains saponins, a plant compound that can have antioxidant properties. According to &lt;a href="https://alexandria-hardy-rdn.clientsecure.me" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alexandria Hardy ,RDN, LDN,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alexandria Hardy ,RDN, LDN,&lt;/a&gt;  owner of Pennsylvania Nutrition Services, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37615648/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:saponins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;saponins&lt;/a&gt; can help the body fight harmful germs, reduce swelling and even protect against certain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to enjoy:&lt;/strong&gt; Roast asparagus with olive oil and garlic, toss it into salads or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/278002/garlic-parmesan-asparagus/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:bake in the oven with some Parmesan cheese;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;bake in the oven with some Parmesan cheese&lt;/a&gt; as a simple side dish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Leafy Greens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leafy greens like spinach, kale, Swiss chard and arugula are rich in vitamins A, C and K, as well as plant compounds like lutein and quercetin, which help combat inflammation., Leafy greens also provide magnesium—a mineral that plays a key role in regulating inflammatory pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to enjoy:&lt;/strong&gt; Add leafy greens to omelets, smoothies or soups. You can also add a handful to nourishing grain bowls like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/263895/green-veggie-bowl-with-chicken-lemon-tahini-dressing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Green Veggie Bowl with Chicken &amp;amp; Lemon-Tahini Dressing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Green Veggie Bowl with Chicken &amp;amp; Lemon-Tahini Dressing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Broccoli&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/broccoli-benefits-8653215" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Broccoli;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Broccoli&lt;/a&gt; is another anti-inflammatory powerhouse, particularly because of its high sulforaphane content. Sulforaphane is classified as a phytochemical—a compound that can help slow down inflammatory pathways in the body. &lt;a href="http://www.thebalancednutritionist.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jamie Nadeau;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jamie Nadeau&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian at The Balanced Nutritionist, highlights research suggesting that sulforaphane may even play a role in inhibiting cancer stem cells. However, further studies are needed to fully understand its potential benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to enjoy:&lt;/strong&gt; Try air-frying broccoli to crispy perfection, add it over mac and cheese for a nutrient-dense addition or toss it into stir-fries like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7890898/shrimp-broccoli-stir-fry/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Shrimp &amp;amp; Broccoli Stir-Fry;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Shrimp &amp;amp; Broccoli Stir-Fry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Pineapples&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pineapple season peaks from March to July, making this the best time to stock up on this tropical fruit. &lt;a href="https://www.faynutrition.com/dietitians/violeta-morris?utm_source=gmb&amp;amp;utm_medium=organic" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Violeta Morris, M.S., RDN,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Violeta Morris, M.S., RDN,&lt;/a&gt; from Columbus, Ohio, at The Concierge Dietitian, says, “Pineapples are a great anti-inflammatory food because they contain bromelain, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8041356/foods-high-in-digestive-enzymes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:an enzyme;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;an enzyme&lt;/a&gt; known to reduce inflammation and improve digestion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to enjoy:&lt;/strong&gt; Add fresh pineapple to smoothie bowls and homemade salsas or try &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8034742/grilled-pineapple/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:grilling pineapple;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;grilling pineapple&lt;/a&gt; for a rich, caramelized flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Avocados&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creamy, versatile and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026117/avocados-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:packed with nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;packed with nutrients&lt;/a&gt;, avocados are an ideal anti-inflammatory food to eat this spring. One standard avocado contains 13.5 grams of fiber and is rich in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and antioxidants—all of which help combat inflammation.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spring’s arrival brings a bounty of fresh seasonal produce, making it the perfect time to enjoy a new set of nourishing foods that may help fight inflammation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While inflammation is a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;natural part of the body’s immune response&lt;/a&gt;, chronic inflammation has been linked to conditions like heart disease, arthritis and autoimmune disorders.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fortunately, a diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods—especially colorful fruits and vegetables—can help combat excess inflammation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spring is the peak season for strawberries, which is good news for your health. These juicy red berries are rich in vitamin C, anthocyanins and flavonoids—powerful compounds that help fight inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research suggests that eating strawberries regularly may support cardiometabolic health and reduce inflammation, particularly in those at higher risk for heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While you can easily find them at a grocery store, there’s nothing better than picking a fresh, ripe strawberry. “If you have a small garden, strawberries are one of the easiest fruits to grow, thriving in raised beds, containers or even hanging baskets. They come back year after year and require minimal care beyond watering and sun exposure,” says &lt;a href="http://www.nourishandrenewnutrition.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Korrinna Kelly, RDN, LD,&lt;/a&gt; founder of Nourish &amp;amp; Renew Nutrition.

It also contains saponins, a plant compound that can have antioxidant properties. According to &lt;a href="https://alexandria-hardy-rdn.clientsecure.me" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alexandria Hardy ,RDN, LDN,&lt;/a&gt;  owner of Pennsylvania Nutrition Services, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37615648/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;saponins&lt;/a&gt; can help the body fight harmful germs, reduce swelling and even protect against certain diseases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Leafy greens like spinach, kale, Swiss chard and arugula are rich in vitamins A, C and K, as well as plant compounds like lutein and quercetin, which help combat inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Leafy greens also provide magnesium—a mineral that plays a key role in regulating inflammatory pathways.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Sulforaphane is classified as a phytochemical—a compound that can help slow down inflammatory pathways in the body. &lt;a href="http://www.thebalancednutritionist.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jamie Nadeau&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian at The Balanced Nutritionist, highlights research suggesting that sulforaphane may even play a role in inhibiting cancer stem cells.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, further studies are needed to fully understand its potential benefits.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pineapple season peaks from March to July, making this the best time to stock up on this tropical fruit. &lt;a href="https://www.faynutrition.com/dietitians/violeta-morris?utm_source=gmb&amp;amp;utm_medium=organic" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Violeta Morris, M.S., RDN,&lt;/a&gt; from Columbus, Ohio, at The Concierge Dietitian, says, “Pineapples are a great anti-inflammatory food because they contain bromelain, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8041356/foods-high-in-digestive-enzymes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;an enzyme&lt;/a&gt; known to reduce inflammation and improve digestion.”

I knew something was seriously wrong, and I wasn’t going to stop until I found out what it was.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two years after Ava's ordeal began, blood and urine tests finally revealed Ava had been sickened by &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14263615/health-expert-reveals-food-never-fridge-mold-poisoning.html"&gt;toxins from mold&lt;/a&gt; growing in the family's basement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ava Chambers, pictured here, came down with Covid at age 14. Soon after, her health rapidly deteriorated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ava, pictured here in the hospital, was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and became so weak that she had to use a cane to walk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further testing of the family's home showed mold from the basement would vent into Ava's room, leaving the rest of the family healthy while Ava deteriorated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After removing mold from their home, Anna said her now 19-year-old daughter's recovery was 'like watching a miracle unfold.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It wasn't an easy process, and Ava is still healing, but she is doing so much better now,' she added.  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Black mold, more formally known as Stachybotrys chartarum, grows in damp, warm environments like basements, bathrooms, kitchens, and areas with leaks or other forms of water damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It releases naturally occurring compounds called mycotoxins, which can accumulate in the body and lead to a host of health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Ava's case, the mycotoxins likely damaged her intestinal lining, causing inflammatory issues like ulcerative colitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mycotoxins can also suppress the immune system, irritate the lungs, and cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to neurological issues like headaches, dizziness, and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ava also tested positive for a mutation of her HLA-DR gene, which affects one in four Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gene is believed to disrupt human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins, weakening the immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been shown to make patients more susceptible to mold-related injuries. In fact, nine in 10 patients being treated for mold injuries test positive for an HLA gene mutation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ava was also diagnosed with two strains of Lyme disease and Epstein-Barr virus, a common illness that stays dormant in most people but can be reactivated through certain exposures, such as mold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anna said the family 'firmly believes mold was the root cause' of Ava's ulcerative colitis, and the teen has stopped taking medications for the illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ava is also managing her condition with a 'tailored protocol and detoxification plan.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows six types of mold you're most likely to find in your home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ava, pictured here with her mother, now manages her condition with a personalized detoxification plan. Her mother said: 'She’s cautious, and she knows that living a clean, non-toxic lifestyle is a part of her ongoing healing'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear what exactly this entails, though antifungal medications, nasal sprays, and home remedies like breathing in salty air - halotherapy - and activated charcoal are thought to help manage symptoms.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anna said: '[Ava] knows she has the genetics that makes detoxing difficult, but now she also has the knowledge and skills to manage her health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She’s cautious, and she knows that living a clean, non-toxic lifestyle is a part of her ongoing healing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anna now urges parents and caregivers to trust their instincts if their child is suffering from a mysterious illness and not getting answers from doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Our world is filled with toxins that can wreak havoc on the body. I believe people are starting to wake up to this reality, but there’s still so much more to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Stories like ours can help raise awareness and bring about the changes in medicine that are desperately needed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 16:47:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Cannabis painkiller ‘can replace opioids with no danger of addiction’ - The Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFBVV95cUxOR0htWmtxbFQ0Sy1pRXJiX2tieFNpMk5ybEhqZ05kVFJaVXhRWlRhaXcxdWRDNTVPR3pWbFVPZFFyRUJRZWtvbVpxQWZxV3JlTkdOME5iTUd6dmNCRUh5V0JtZDFrUDB0MFRMS2F0MjQwbUdlVmRleVR0VjVOMmxwVjV0Qk1qR1B6X0lXNWVSMl9taEcySHNKMnktVVktUHFuMkd5Z2xPZEFaMC1fRmtLQUtWTV9peE1uN0ZFc0pB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 kuowVf"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A German drug company claims to have produced the first non-addictive and clinically proven painkiller based on the cannabis plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The drug, developed under the codename VER-01, is said to have been found effective in a final-stage clinical trial that recruited 800 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It was tested on patients suffering from chronic lower back pain, the most common form of chronic pain globally.

Fischer said that the trials had found no evidence of VER-01 users becoming intoxicated, however, because the levels of THC in their system were too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;That said, he added that 20-25 per cent of patients did “feel a bit dizzy” for a couple of weeks after starting the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;There was no evidence of other side-effects commonly associated with cannabis, such as changes to appetite. “We were looking very carefully, because that’s what we hear from cannabis smokers — that the appetite increases as well their weight.

              &lt;p&gt;We may have just found an easy-to-swallow cure for one of the deadliest diseases out there. In research released this month, scientists report that an once-daily experimental pill dramatically reduced the high fatality rate of Ebola infection, at least in nonhuman primates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch led the study, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adw0659"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Friday in the journal Science Advances. The treatment, an oral antiviral called obeldesivir, prevented up to 100% of deaths in monkeys given a high dose of the deadliest species of Ebola. These findings and others suggest that obeldesivir can become a highly effective measure against Ebola and similar infections that can quickly lead to massive bleeding and death, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/causes/index.html"&gt;Ebola&lt;/a&gt; is caused by several related strains of viruses (formally called orthoebolaviruses). The most commonly seen and deadliest version of Ebola is caused by the Zaire ebolavirus (named after where it was first discovered), which can have a fatality rate as high as 90% if untreated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Symptoms of Ebola initially include fever, aches, and other flu-like symptoms, but the infection can rapidly progress and cause widespread organ damage and heavy internal bleeding that seeps out of people’s bodies, which is known as hemorrhagic fever.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Ebola is a zoonotic disease, meaning outbreaks typically begin when a person is exposed to infected animals (African fruit bats are thought to be a primary reservoir). But it can also spread between people through close contact with bodily fluids, including blood and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/ebola-can-hide-in-humans-for-years-before-killing-again-1847688061"&gt;semen&lt;/a&gt;. While the rapid progression of symptoms and high lethality of Ebola often prevent the infection from spreading widely, it has occasionally sparked &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ebola/outbreaks/index.html"&gt;large-scale outbreaks. &lt;/a&gt;During 2014 to 2016, for instance, a Zaire ebolavirus outbreak in West Africa infected almost 30,000 people and killed more than 11,000. No outbreaks since have reached that level of destruction, but Ebola and related hemorrhagic viruses continue to be a grave public health threat in the countries where they’re natively found.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nowadays, there are effective approved vaccines and treatments for some species of Ebola. But the vaccine supply is limited and the current antibody-based treatments have to be stored in cold conditions and taken intravenously, limiting their availability and usefulness. So the UTMB researchers believe that obeldesivir—an oral version of the antiviral remdesivir, originally developed to treat covid-19—can represent a pivotal step forward in Ebola treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In their new study, they gave cynomolgus and rhesus macaques a lethal dose of a variant of Zaire ebolavirus, then gave them obeldesivir starting a day after exposure for 10 days. Incredibly, 100% of rhesus macaques given obeldesivir survived their infection, while 80% of cynomolgus macaques did as well. The treatment delayed the virus’ ability to replicate and even seemed to promote the monkeys’ adaptive, or antibody-based, immune response to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s earlier work with monkeys has already found that obeldesivir might be effective against Sudan virus, the second most commonly encountered species of Ebola. Earlier this January, the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03496-y"&gt;also found&lt;/a&gt; that obeldesivir could protect monkeys from Marburg, another deadly cousin of Ebola (a &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/countries/united-republic-of-tanzania/news/tanzania-declares-end-marburg-virus-disease-outbreak"&gt;recently ended outbreak&lt;/a&gt; of Marburg killed at least 10 people in Tanzania this year).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;More research will be needed to validate the drug’s potential against Ebola in humans, of course. But the researchers are hopeful that obeldesivir can become a broadly applied and more convenient weapon against these deadly infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For outbreak response, oral antivirals might present substantial advantages over now approved intravenous drugs, such as easy supply, storage, distribution, and administration,” they wrote in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt;Ten million people&lt;/a&gt; are diagnosed with dementia worldwide each year – that’s more than ever. &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-us/news-and-media/facts-media"&gt;According to the Alzheimer’s Society&lt;/a&gt; approximately one million people in the UK are currently living with the disease. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-91178-7"&gt;Studies predict&lt;/a&gt; this figure will rise to 1.6 million people by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is the &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/alzheimers-disease"&gt;most common cause of dementia&lt;/a&gt; and leads to a decline in memory and thinking skills. This is a &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/alzheimers-disease"&gt;physical illness&lt;/a&gt; that causes the brain to stop working properly and &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers"&gt;gets worse&lt;/a&gt; over time. Identifying the onset of Alzheimer’s early can help patients and caregivers find the right support and medical care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to detect Alzheimer’s early is by spotting &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26484921/"&gt;changes to&lt;/a&gt; people’s &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09919"&gt;use of language&lt;/a&gt;. This is because &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24142144/"&gt;new speech problems&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-160507"&gt;one of the first signs&lt;/a&gt; of a mental decline that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16193251/"&gt;could indicate the onset&lt;/a&gt; of this disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are five early, speech-related signs of Alzheimer’s disease to look out for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Pauses, hesitations and vagueness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most recognisable symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease is trouble remembering specific words, which can often lead to frequent or long &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-201584"&gt;pauses and hesitations&lt;/a&gt;. When a person with Alzheimer’s is struggling to remember a word, they may talk vaguely such as saying “thing”, or describing and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4462568/"&gt;talking around a word&lt;/a&gt;. For example, if someone is having trouble remembering the word dog, they may say something like “people have them as pets … they bark … I used to have one when I was a child”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Using words with the wrong meaning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trouble remembering the right word can be an early feature of Alzheimer’s. People with Alzheimer’s might &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-12313-008"&gt;replace a word&lt;/a&gt; they are trying to say with something related to it. For example, instead of saying “dog”, they might use an animal from the same category, saying “cat” for instance. In the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, however, these changes are more likely to be related to a broader or more general category such as saying “animal” instead of “cat”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Talking about a task rather than doing it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone with Alzheimer’s may struggle with completing tasks. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1460-6984.12444"&gt;Instead of performing a task&lt;/a&gt;, they may talk about their feelings toward the task, express doubts, or mention past abilities. They might say, “I’m not sure I can do this” or “I used to be good at this”, rather than &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-201584"&gt;discussing the task&lt;/a&gt; directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Less word variety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more subtle indicator of Alzheimer’s disease is the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24142144/"&gt;tendency to use&lt;/a&gt; simpler language, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-201584"&gt;relying on common words&lt;/a&gt;. People with Alzheimer’s often repeat the same verbs, nouns and adjectives &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5137196/"&gt;instead of using a broader vocabulary&lt;/a&gt;. They can also use “the”, “and” or “but” frequently to connect sentences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Difficulty finding the right words&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People with Alzheimer’s &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393204000296"&gt;can have trouble&lt;/a&gt; thinking of words, objects or things that belong in a group. This is sometimes used as a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5929311/"&gt;cognitive test&lt;/a&gt; for the disease. For example, those with Alzheimer’s may struggle to name things in a specific category, such as different foods, different parts of the body or words that start with the same letter. This gets harder as the disease progresses, making these tasks increasingly challenging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Age is the biggest risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s – the chance of developing the disease &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/alzheimers-disease"&gt;doubles every five years&lt;/a&gt; after the age of 65. However, &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/alzheimers-disease/causes/"&gt;one in 20 people&lt;/a&gt; diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease are under the age of 65. This is referred to as younger – or early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While forgetting words now and then is normal, persistent and worsening problems remembering words, speaking fluently, or using a variety of words could be an early sign of Alzheimer’s disease. Identifying these signs early can be particularly important for people at higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease as they age, such as &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/alzheimers-disease-people-down-syndrome"&gt;people with Down Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

We see it as really overarchingly a pro-life program in that it promotes the life-saving need for HIV treatment, which many of us in the field have called The Lazarus Effect,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“When you get someone on antiretroviral therapy, you see them literally be able to come back to life. And now we know if you’re on antiretroviral therapy, you can even prevent the spread of the virus to others so it’s not just life-saving for you, it can be life-saving for loads of other people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Chambers Sharpe criticised what she called a “lack of transparency” within the state department about cuts to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usaid" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;USAid&lt;/a&gt; and its impact on Pepfar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Galen Carey, vice-president of government relations at the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE), which has backed some of Trump’s policies while also criticizing its harsh treatment of refugees as unChristian, called on the administration to save Pepfar before it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We’re encouraging the administration to get the program back up to full speed as soon as possible,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Carey said “there’s quite a bit of concern in Congress because Pepfar has been a very popular bipartisan program” but he added that it has been caught up in the broader assault on foreign aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;About 20 million people are reliant on medicines supplied by Pepfar mostly in Africa and parts of Asia. Some countries, such as Nigeria, depend on Pepfar for almost all their HIV funding. Others are less reliant but Pepfar still provides crucial health infrastructure because its clinics frequently employ medical staff who treat other conditions as part of the broader programme of combatting Aids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Matthew Loftus, a doctor and evangelical Christian working at a mission hospital in Kenya, said the damage was already being done on the ground. He said that Pepfar “is being dismantled” and that “many people will die” as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ced82143-732f-4bcc-aa8b-2928bed2f14e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":14,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘Disruptive, unfair and cruel’: jobs lost and treatment stopped as USAid freeze hits HIV care in Zimbabwe","elementId":"ced82143-732f-4bcc-aa8b-2928bed2f14e","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/feb/14/usaid-freeze-hits-hiv-aids-care-in-zimbabwe"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“In some places they’re not getting the drugs or they’re being asked to pay cash for the drugs. Other places are completely closed and so patients are scrambling to find medications or they’re going without,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“There are going to be consequences. Once you stop taking ARVs, within days the virus can come back online and then start developing resistance. I’m really scared that there are going to be a bunch of people who haven’t been taking their drugs and then, when we try to start them back, we’re going to find that they’re resistant. They could turn everything back on tomorrow and I think there would be permanent damage. Once you fire people and close clinics, rebuilding trust is difficult, getting people to come back is difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Evangelical Christian groups were instrumental in persuading President George W Bush to launch Pepfar in 2004. Carey said churches saw it not only as a pro-life position but an opportunity to promote their values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“When I first went to Africa in 1997, an HIV-positive diagnosis was basically a death sentence. It was devastating. Many pastors spent much of their time conducting funerals. Driving along main roads in Kenya you would see shop after shop selling coffins,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Over time, it really turned around in a dramatic way. The stories that came out of caring for orphans and helping local churches and promoting Christian understanding of sexual morality and faithfulness in marriage was an important piece of the puzzle since a lot of the transmission was through sexual contact. It fitted in with our broader concerns, both pro-life and pro-family.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A change of heart by the acerbic segregationist senator, Jesse Helms, brought on a lot of conservative support by shifting the US narrative around Aids away from sexual morality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In 2003, the rock star Bono told Helms that Aids had created 10 million orphans in Africa and that the lives of newborn babies could be saved by a single dose of a medicine that limited the transmission of HIV from mother to child. Helms was persuaded that Aids relief was a pro-life position and opened the door to congressional support for Pepfar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Loftus has seen the impact of the programme on the ground in Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c6d63665-ece1-4e16-96f5-42f4265068ca" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A child sits as a nurse prepares to dispense antiretroviral drugs at the Nyumbani Children’s Home, in Nairobi, Kenya, which is supported by Pepfar.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Thomas Mukoya/Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Most HIV-positive patients I see are patients whose viral load is completely suppressed and they are coming to the hospital for a different problem. When I do see someone who dies of HIV-related illness, it’s just another tragedy because now it’s completely preventable,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I hear stories from older missionaries. They talk about wards full of people with Aids, dying all the time. That’s part of the fear looking ahead. If these programmes don’t survive, what are we going to go back to?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The call to save Pepfar has been joined by a range of religious groups, including the National Latino Evangelical Coalition. But Loftus said that, as an evangelical, he was concerned that many churches are not speaking up in support of the initiative, even though they have in the past, because it would mean criticising Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“People I talk to are aggrieved about this. It is challenging the way that churches follow political trends rather than the other way around,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Some churches are not as eager to put their necks out and advocate for something that seems to be opposed by some of the people in power. I think churches and Christians who are politically active are not aware of what’s at stake, and many of them are probably consuming news in an environment that isn’t even bringing it up as an issue. But I think also that there is this conflict now between our convictions versus who’s in charge and who do we want to please?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 16:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNcHZmOTJ4VmFZQWUyeVRhZHM4dTZQRFJGVjB5N1Y2UWxTRk55Y2xDRXNmT05iVDdzZnJmWXMyYmItMWxGaXJ2Y2Rnd3A0TGRaRVNBMmRaU1FhbldzNl83bm9vbmFzdzJ6ZDhub1k5bE9pX1ROblhjcEQtSXBieTBIbXhocjZuams</guid></item><item><title>Even Four Cups A Day!

Well, some people associate it with urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Here’s what you need to know about urea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-urea" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What is urea?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Urea is a nitrogen molecule, and &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/urea" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a chemical byproduct&lt;/a&gt; of the body’s metabolic breakdown of proteins. In mammals, it is found most abundantly in urine, as well as blood, sweat and milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;More than 90% of global &lt;a href="https://www.acs.org/molecule-of-the-week/archive/u/urea.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;urea production&lt;/a&gt; goes into agriculture; it is a popular fertilizer ingredient and has been &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40351-5" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; as “the food of food”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;When it comes to skincare, urea is most often used in creams, but it can also be a component of gels, lotions and ointments. It serves as a humectant – meaning, it retains moisture in the top layer of the skin. This fortifies the skin barrier and results in “a more moisturized and plumped feeling to the skin”, says Strom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"elementId":"372ae338-0ff0-454e-8217-4671db9795f7","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="372ae338-0ff0-454e-8217-4671db9795f7" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It is sold in a range of concentrations, up to 40%. At concentrations above 10%, it also serves as a keratolytic, an exfoliant that helps the body shed the top layer of skin. If not exfoliated, dead skin cells build up and can result in dry, cracked skin, “like on the heels of the feet”, Strom says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-urea-pee" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Is urea pee?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Although urea is one of the most abundant components of urine, commercial urea is a synthetic produced in laboratories. You can see some very complicated diagrams about how it’s produced &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40351-5" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, none of which mention toilets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="which-conditions-can-a-urea-cream-treat" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Which conditions can a urea cream treat?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Urea is commonly used to treat skin that is “really dry and rough”, says Dr Naeha Gupta, a board certified dermatologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;These rough patches are often the result of conditions like eczema, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/keratosis-pilaris/symptoms-causes/syc-20351149" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;keratosis pilaris&lt;/a&gt;, a common and harmless condition that causes small red bumps to appear on the upper arms, legs and buttocks. These conditions all can result in the buildup of dead skin cells, and “something like urea can be really helpful for breaking down the skin and letting it discharge”, says Strom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;High concentrations of urea can break down the thick-skin buildup in calluses, says Dr Rajani Katta, clinical professor of dermatology at the McGovern Medical School at the University of Texas Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Urea can also be used to “soften and remove damaged or diseased nails”, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/19302-urea-skin-cream-gel-lotion-ointment-or-nail-lacquer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-use-urea-cream" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;How do you use urea cream?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Low concentrations of urea – below 10% – are gentle and can safely be used on the body once or twice a day, Gupta says. She recommends applying a cream after a shower, when skin has been patted dry but there’s still some water on its surface. “The cream can really help retain that moisture,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-20" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Body moisturizers tend to include higher concentrations of urea, which can irritate the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;For feet and calluses, Gupta suggests applying a higher-concentration urea product before bed, then slipping on socks. “That way, you make sure it’s not rubbing off and you’re really getting it into those thick areas,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;I did this last week, and can confirm my dry, cracked feet were slightly less dry and cracked the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-risks-of-urea-cream" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What are the risks of urea cream?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Overall, [urea] is probably one of the safer ingredients in skincare,” says Strom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d1bcd356-6fd3-479b-9f5b-2ab61c3d85c7" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":26,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Ditch the soap!

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story is part of the My Unsung Hero series, from the Hidden Brain team. It features stories of people whose kindness left a lasting impression on someone else.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2022, Glenna Osborne's father, Ronald Osborne, passed away. To prepare for his memorial service, the family went through his belongings. In the process, they came across a note that Ronald had written about his dear friend, Eddie Coleman. The two men were both firefighters and had battled blazes together for many years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The note read, "For firefighter and special friend Eddie, who saved my life. John 15:13, 'Greater love has no one than to lay down one's life for one's friend.'"&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Ronald had told his daughter and the rest of the family that Coleman had saved his life, but had never gone into detail. Curious to know more about her deceased father's history, Glenna reached out to Coleman and asked if he would tell her what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Coleman told her about the day when he was 21 and her father was 19. They'd been called to a house fire.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When they arrived, they saw a two-story home engulfed in flames. And Eddie and my father ended up on the roof fighting this fire," Glenna said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"My father went to take a step and he started to fall through the roof, and Eddie quickly reached in, grabbed the collar of [my father's] firefighter coat and somehow pulled him up to safety — away from what my father had once said would have been a sure death."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Before this event, the two men had been close. But the moment at the house fire bonded them together. They were friends until the day Ronald died.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Glenna is grateful that she learned Coleman's full story. It gave her a new understanding of her father's devotion to his friend.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm so thankful that Eddie did this for my father and for my family... because without him, none of us would be here. So, we are just indebted to him for his courage and his quick thinking in the line of duty and the fact that he saved my father's life."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span class="tag-term"&gt;Media Advisory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2025-03-17T11:45:00-04:00" class="date-display-single"&gt;Monday, March 17, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;NIH-funded study identifies potential new stroke treatment&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;
Preclinical study in rodents suggests that uric acid is ready for human clinical testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a preclinical study, rodents treated with uric acid showed improved long-term outcomes after acute ischemic stroke. The findings suggest that the treatment may work as an add-on therapy to standard stroke treatments in humans. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and published in &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.124.048748"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stroke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Led by Enrique Leira, M.D., and Anil Chauhan, Ph.D., at the University of Iowa, Iowa City, researchers used a well-established rodent model of stroke that closely simulates stroke in humans. They administered intravenous uric acid or saline control and monitored animals’ recovery over one month. Behavioral and neurological assessments, including MRI scans, were used to evaluate the treatment’s effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mice treated with uric acid had better sensorimotor function—the primary outcome measure—30 days after stroke. More animals in the uric acid group also survived their stroke compared to control animals. However, some secondary outcome measures, such as brain damage, were not reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research teams used equal numbers of male and female animals and studied older, young, and obese mice, as well as rats with hypertension. Uric acid was efficacious across all groups, suggesting that the treatment could potentially perform well in human trials, including in people with stroke comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/stroke"&gt;Ischemic stroke&lt;/a&gt;, a leading cause of disability and death in the United States, occurs when a blood clot or other blockage in an artery cuts off blood supply to the brain. Strokes are treated with medications or surgery aimed to break up clots and restore blood flow to affected brain areas. These therapies are highly effective, but not all people fully recover. Using additional treatments that protect brain tissue from damage, either immediately before or during clot removal, could boost the effects of standard treatments and greatly improve recovery in patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study was part of the NIH’s &lt;a href="https://spannetwork.org/"&gt;Stroke Preclinical Assessment Network (SPAN)&lt;/a&gt;, a rigorous, transparent approach to preclinical research that mimics clinical trials. SPAN applies standard clinical practices, like randomization and blinded analysis, to animal studies, with the goal of finding agents that are likely to succeed in clinical trials. Recently, the network &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/researchers-develop-new-method-identify-potential-stroke-therapies"&gt;tested six promising stroke treatments&lt;/a&gt; and found one, uric acid, that showed efficacy. The current study described the results of this trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) (U01NS113388, U24NS113452) and the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (R35HL139926).&lt;/p&gt;

And if it’s not, everything’s going to change,’” she tells TODAY.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After the surgery, when doctors discovered that her tumor was benign, Walsh kept her promise and started shifting the way she lived her life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It was all the cliché things — work less, spend more time with family and friends — and I was very fortunate,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Ten years later, Walsh is still grateful that her health scare didn't go down a darker path, and she's hoping to pay it forward by encouraging everyone to get proactive about their health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The 57-year-old is partnering with Grail as part of the healthcare company's &lt;a href="https://www.genpossible.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Generation Possible&lt;/a&gt; campaign to highlight the value of early cancer screening and multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Per Generation Possible, MCED tests are available through authorized ordering providers and involve a blood draw that “can screen for many different types of cancer, often before symptoms appear.” This form of testing is particularly useful for cancers that “currently don’t have recommended screenings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When an MCED test detects a cancer signal, a patient's healthcare provider can offer recommendations for additional diagnostic testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Walsh is particularly passionate about early detection given her family's history with cancer. When she was in her early twenties, her father was diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer and given six months to live, a prognosis Walsh recalls being "shocking and devastating." He ended up surviving for a year and a half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Back then, cancer was like a death sentence. We’ve come a long way,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A few years later, Walsh's mother was diagnosed with breast cancer in her early sixties and faced some difficult decisions while contemplating treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"I remember we thought, 'Is this a little extreme to have a double mastectomy?' And also we really naively thought that she would be in the clear because she was in her sixties. We didn’t have any history of cancer in the family on my mother’s side of the family," she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After undergoing a double mastectomy, Walsh's mother went on to live into her nineties. The health scare inspired Walsh to get early breast cancer screenings herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"That was something I really kind of fought for because my health carriers were like, ‘Why should we do that?’" she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Several decades later, Walsh tapped into the same perseverance to advocate for herself when she started experiencing &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/kate-walsh-brain-tumor-symptoms-rcna194188" target="_blank"&gt;exhaustion and cognitive symptoms &lt;/a&gt;that made her think something was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"A lot of people were like, 'You’re just depressed. You’re sad because your TV show got canceled.' Or 'You’re a woman of a certain age and going through menopause, and that’s probably it.' It was like, something doesn’t feel right, and I had to keep pushing and pushing and pushing and advocating. And, thank goodness I did," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/kate-walsh-zz-250317-02-e4edb2.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/kate-walsh-zz-250317-02-e4edb2.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/kate-walsh-zz-250317-02-e4edb2.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/kate-walsh-zz-250317-02-e4edb2.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/kate-walsh-zz-250317-02-e4edb2.jpg" alt="Kate Walsh."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Kate Walsh had a benign brain tumor removed in 2015.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;GRAIL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Eventually, Walsh got a diagnostic MRI that showed she had a tumor in her brain. After surgery, she got the good news that it was benign. From there, she began to make some lifestyle changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Walsh had been working in TV with "intense" hours for so long at that point that she was ready for a change of pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I think when you’re younger, you’re like, ‘I don’t want to miss out on life. I’ve got this massive job, so I’m going to burn the candle at both ends,” she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Walsh had always prioritized working out as part of a balanced lifestyle, but she started to focus a bit more on rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"Rest became a big thing and a surrender. It’s like they say, the body keeps score. For me, that was absolutely true. And so if I was tired, I was like, ‘Ok, I’ve got to rest,’” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20370588" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, there are many possible cancer risk factors including age, smoking, drinking and chronic health conditions. Since maintaining a healthy diet and staying physically active can &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/cancer-prevention/art-20044816" target="_blank"&gt;lower your chances of developing cancer,&lt;/a&gt; these are two things Walsh focuses on as part of a healthy lifestyle these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The actor says she eats "pretty well" but doesn’t deny herself when cravings arise, especially when potato chips are involved. When it comes to her workouts, Walsh loves Pilates and has made lifting weights a key part of her routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Weight training is critical for bone density and muscle strength. All of my friends that are in their 50s, we’re all talking about lower body strength especially. You’ve got to be able to sit down on the floor and be able to get up unassisted," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/kate-walsh-zz-250317-01-1b221d.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/kate-walsh-zz-250317-01-1b221d.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/kate-walsh-zz-250317-01-1b221d.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/kate-walsh-zz-250317-01-1b221d.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/kate-walsh-zz-250317-01-1b221d.jpg" alt="Kate Walsh."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Kate Walsh enjoys weight training as part of her workout routine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;GRAIL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For those who have a family history of cancer like Walsh, the &lt;a href="https://www.genpossible.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Generation Possible website&lt;/a&gt; features a quiz to determine if MCED testing is right for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"The great thing about what’s happening in our culture now is that there is a move towards prevention, as opposed to being reactive. And so this is just another step in that direction,” she explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At the same time, Walsh cautions that MCED testing is best used alongside routine checkups at the doctor's office and traditional testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Though the actor played a doctor on “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Private Practice,” she admits that she still gets intimidated going to medical appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"I get very nervous about talking to doctors and I kind of dissociate. I leave my body and I’m like, ‘Wait, what am I supposed to ask you?’” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Generation Possible website features a discussion guide to offer patients resources for talking to their doctors about their cancer risk factors. Unfortunately, Walsh knows firsthand that a trip to the doctor can often be the start of a long and frustrating quest for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Walsh is a big proponent of advocating for yourself, even when you meet roadblocks along the way. To help, she recommends bringing a friend or partner to your appointments to take notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;"We’ve been socialized (to believe) that doctors are experts in their field, which indeed, many of them are. But we’re supposed to not ask and just listen and say, 'Ok you take it away.' And there isn’t a dialogue. And that’s the thing, there has to be a dialogue," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 15:26:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNSEtCT1oyVUk2Ui0wUzRmSUR6cjU3a09NbEVrWFZaa3JIQ21Rd3NBNVRkTTlyeTR6SU9ScnNSTTdIcFRpNEFObF90UERieWZCZlltaWRoVkFISVU0ZUItT0RCalhmRU52QTVWU2V0ZlZsRWZsdEtUNGhOYVlPY1d6TWdmM2F4dWk4RzN0cnJReVFGTkJlZ2ZUZ05rZkJDQdIBVEFVX3lxTE5lMDJHZVJxTloydExQWGFGZVRPaFRfbkpPQTRLcC1neUpkSFUwVXlSNmZwUHdmZ3F0bF9fdC1Rdl9yRGFpcmFjakI3bWpCVTBzSVJHcw</guid></item><item><title>NIH-sponsored trial of Lassa vaccine opens - National Institutes of Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxNR05ZNEFfMjNMMlE0WGxPVjFoSDIxY1F3WWJscEQ0cmFTbVAzZ3UwUzhEUGhDZGxGQldPMXN1UVc3TENRSjlFRVhoMXFVYXNsajEwUGNobkZCYzQ3TjlmSlY3Q0hVMGgtYzBDcTM2THozUzR6VFpNai1wZDRqMWlZcFlsdnRiM2dacnFGR3lR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="l-content" role="main"&gt;

Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic disease that can be fatal and that causes permanent hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A National Institutes of Health (NIH)-sponsored clinical trial of a candidate vaccine to prevent Lassa fever has begun enrolling participants at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore. Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic disease that can be fatal and that causes permanent hearing loss in up to one-third of those who contract it. Lassa virus is spread by rodents, known as multimammate rats, that are native to many countries in West Africa. The virus can also be spread from person to person. Currently, there are no specific drug treatments or vaccines for Lassa fever. NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is sponsoring the Phase 1 trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The candidate vaccine being tested in this trial was developed by an NIH-supported research team at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia,” said NIAID Director Jeanne Marrazzo, M.D., M.P.H. “The progression of this candidate from the lab to a first-in-humans clinical trial is a promising step towards a vaccine to prevent Lassa fever.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial will enroll up to 55 healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 50 years to test the safety and immunogenicity of three different concentrations of the vaccine candidate. Participants will receive two injections, delivered 28 days apart, of either the vaccine candidate or a Food and Drug Administration-licensed rabies vaccine (control).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-024-00930-z#Sec2"&gt;research published in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, Matthias Schnell, Ph.D., and colleagues at Thomas Jefferson University tested the experimental vaccine, known as LASSARAB, in nonhuman primates. They found that two doses of the vaccine, delivered 28 days apart, protected all the immunized animals that were exposed to large and lethal amounts of Lassa virus six weeks after the second inoculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LASSARAB is based on a weakened (attenuated) rabies vaccine that is subsequently inactivated to make the vaccine candidate. The experimental vaccine is then modified so that it expresses all the rabies proteins found in inactivated rabies vaccine along with a Lassa virus surface protein called the glycoprotein precursor complex (GPC). If LASSARAB is shown to be safe and elicits a good immune response to both the rabies proteins and the Lassa GPC, it could be used to prevent both diseases pending further testing in clinical trials and subsequent approval by the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional information about the new clinical trial is available at &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/"&gt;clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/a&gt; using the identifier &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06546709?id=NCT06546709%20&amp;amp;rank=1"&gt;NCT06546709&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NIAID conducts and supports research—at NIH, throughout the United States, and worldwide—to study the causes of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and to develop better means of preventing, diagnosing and treating these illnesses. News releases, fact sheets and other NIAID-related materials are available on the &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/"&gt;NIAID website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the National Institutes of Health (NIH):&lt;/strong&gt;

Researchers gave people aged over 60 two different supplements, inulin and FOS (fructooligosaccharide). They wanted to better understand how &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/gut-health-score-93-out-30672961" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; could impact brain function and muscle health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And they found that those who took the fibre supplement "performed better in tests assessing brain function, including the Paired Associates Learning test, which is an early marker for Alzheimer’s disease".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The study took place in 2024, when researchers at TwinsUK (a large adult twin registry), at King’s College London, sought to understand how targeting the gut microbiome (&lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/gut-health-score-93-out-30672961" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;the diverse community of micro-organisms in our intestines&lt;/a&gt;) with "two cheap, commercially available plant fibre supplements" could impact both muscle health and brain function. Scientists are becoming increasingly convinced that the gut microbiome is crucial to our overall health, with some going as far as calling it our "second brain". They say it impacts everything from our immune system to mental health. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;section data-embed-group="read-more" data-embed-items="2" data-ad-dockable="true" data-redesign-embed="true"&gt; &lt;aside class="read-more-links" data-mod="readMoreTweak" data-immediate=""&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers assigned 36 twin pairs (that's 72 individuals) who were all over 60 years old either a supplement or a placebo to take every day for 12 weeks. All study participants also did resistance exercises and ate a protein supplement which was aimed at improving muscle function.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a report of the study published on the Kings College website, researchers "found the fibre supplement led to significant changes in the participants' gut microbiome composition, particularly an increase in the numbers of beneficial bacteria such as Bifidobacterium".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It added: "While there was no significant difference in muscle strength between the groups, the group receiving the fibre supplement performed better in tests assessing brain function, including the Paired Associates Learning test which is an early marker for Alzheimer’s disease, together with tests of reaction time and processing speed. These measures are important for daily living – for example reacting to traffic or stopping a simple trip-up turning into a fall."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;section data-embed-group="read-more" data-embed-items="2" data-ad-dockable="true" data-redesign-embed="true"&gt; &lt;aside class="read-more-links" data-mod="readMoreTweak" data-immediate=""&gt;

&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study's senior author, Professor Claire Steves, professor of ageing and health at Kings College, said: "These plant fibres, which are cheap and available over-the counter, could benefit a wide group of people in these cash-strapped times. They are safe and acceptable too. Our next task is to see whether these effects are sustained over longer periods and in larger groups of people."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mary Ni Lochlainn, a geriatric medicine researcher at King's College London, said: "We are excited to see these changes in just 12 weeks. This holds huge promise for enhancing brain health and memory in our aging population. Unlocking the secrets of the gut-brain axis could offer new approaches for living more healthily for longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 15:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxPVmpzelY0NEt2NXdUZVVVZlNxR2dRMFJ2c3lYUVdwdmJVUG1va3ROQWlMRWRWZElhVW1DdGpCanNBS3A2WHU1LWIwNmVFbml6cjlKcERESGdzS1R6akhWRWdaNHpiSExzaEJEenEyQjY0c3NETW95dmFUaEd6d1BtQ29HZjlJMWvSAYwBQVVfeXFMTjNOWEJiWDBqVGN6LXlzaV92OW40UmpnaHU4SHdSV2FJT2F4bVJpcDlILVhJdE02NmEtZ3RnNnRUVXNtTVBrZmxSUGoxS240M2FtZ1ZfRFh5bkJNeGRLcHpRSkx1UDB3anN6LS1aWG5Bbzl1V2NmMGo4SmdqZVFTdUlCQXFkLVJvaFdTVE4</guid></item><item><title>UN agency warns of ‘unprecedented’ bird flu threat as H5N1 virus jumps to mammals - POLITICO Europe</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxNcGVxVlNwT09iZVY4Q0ZTMjRKMjAzdnV6ZjlqaTA5dzUyU3dObUtmNktZUVVESER5Xy1TUVdxRHF4NEc0VW9hak4wY3R2dHBfREJVQ0VOb1hiZ0JaZElyTlA3OTFSRFdXdlVZdU5La21Ud01MVTJBNm5jVmVtTGdXM0pYNmx5WlplQWFvN19qTE5rYk1WVkpRRlpiaFkyMWdCaU1YVVU1T3pjbjU5NjEtNDln?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="card__content"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Children in the United States are increasingly suffering from persistent or severe health conditions, many of which are preventable and could follow them into adulthood, according to new research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The findings come from a long-term survey of more than 230,000 young people, whose families reported whether they had any chronic conditions, like asthma, or functional limitations, like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the results, the percentage of kids who are dealing with any of these conditions or limitations has risen from nearly 23 percent in 1999 to just over 30 percent in 2018.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That's nearly one in three young people who are now thought to be living with severe or activity-limiting health concerns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In children aged 5 to 17, the survey's data suggests the jump in chronic conditions is mainly due to ADHD/ADD, autism, and asthma. For young adults between 18 and 25, on the other hand, the increase is largely because of asthma, seizures or epilepsy, and pre-diabetes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154919" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154919" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFL-642x361.png" alt="Child Chronic Health Conditions" class="size-medium wp-image-154919" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFL-642x361.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFL-739x415.png 739w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFL-768x431.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFL-1536x863.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFL-600x337.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFL.png 1798w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154919" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Annual trends in chronic conditions and functional limitations in children from 1999 to 2018. (Wisk and Sharma, &lt;em&gt;Academic Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rising functional limitations in children, meanwhile, were primarily driven by speech conditions, musculoskeletal issues, depression, anxiety, emotional problems, or other mental health conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because some of these conditions are preventable, the results hint at an overlooked and underserviced population.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We estimate that there are currently 87.4 million youth ages 5 and 25 in the US, of which 25.7 million reported any chronic condition or functional limitation," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.academicpedsjnl.net/article/S1876-2859(25)00035-X/fulltext"&gt;&lt;span&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the authors of the study, Lauren Wisk, who studies health services at the University of California Los Angeles, and pediatrician Niraj Sharma from Harvard University.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This amounts to 1.2 million youth with a chronic condition or functional limitation who currently turn 18 each year."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154920" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154920" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFLYoungAdults-642x361.png" alt="Young Adult Chronic Health Conditions" class="size-medium wp-image-154920" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFLYoungAdults-642x361.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFLYoungAdults-739x415.png 739w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFLYoungAdults-768x431.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFLYoungAdults-1536x863.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFLYoungAdults-600x337.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/AnnualTrendsCCFLYoungAdults.png 1798w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154920" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Annual trends in chronic conditions and functional limitations in young adults from 1999 to 2018. (Wisk and Sharma, &lt;em&gt;Academic Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That's a lot of children who will need ongoing care as they grow older. Past &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4098714/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggest, however, that doctors in the US are poorly prepared to treat rising conditions of childhood origin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a paper from 2014, researchers &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4098714/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;wrote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that when transitioning from pediatric to adult-centered health care, "many youth do not receive the age-appropriate medical care they need and are at risk during this vulnerable time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Figuring out what is actually driving these upward trends in pediatric chronic conditions will require much more detailed research. There are likely numerous factors at play, including a "complex interaction of individual biology, community context and environment, and health care systems," explain Wisk and Sharma.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the two co-authors carefully accounted for a whole variety of socioeconomic variables that may be influencing their results, they found substantial disparities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kids with chronic illnesses were more likely to be poor, unemployed, or have public, not private, insurance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Most youth with chronic conditions need to access health and social services for the rest of their lives, but our health system is not set up to successfully move young people from pediatric to adult focused care and so many of these youth are at risk of disengaging with care and experiencing disease exacerbations," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/pediatric-chronic-disease-prevalence-has-risen-nearly-30"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Wisk. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We should invest in assisting these youth in engaging appropriately with healthcare across their lifespan in order to protect their health and well-being, and to facilitate their maximum participation in society with respect to education, vocation, social groups, and community spaces."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unfortunately, as of 2019, the same survey used in the current study – called the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) – no longer asks as many detailed questions related to chronic conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This makes it harder to gauge where we are headed, or how the 2020 pandemic impacted childhood mental and physical health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This means we no longer have the ability to track and analyze trends in chronic health conditions in youth past that date," &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/pediatric-chronic-disease-prevalence-has-risen-nearly-30"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wisk. "We need to find creative new ways to continue to monitor the health of our nation's youth if we want to further study this population."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.academicpedsjnl.net/article/S1876-2859(25)00035-X/fulltext"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Academic Pediatrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We have a little less than three years to go,” Jessica Coble wrote in an email. “We knew the treatment was a little over two years long, but it was still a nice surprise when we heard the actual date of it ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a feeling of relief, we made it through. Riggs was so happy, he took his last pill, rang a bell I bought for him, then ran off and played with his cousins.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That does not mean the Cobles are done worrying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think anytime he gets a fever post-treatment, I will worry, or if he looks pale or tired,” Jessica Coble said. “These were some of his symptoms before he was diagnosed. I will constantly be praying that he doesn’t relapse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessica Coble said there are many side effects, including problems with infertility, fatigue, cognitive changes, low resistance to infection, heart problems and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessica Coble said Riggs is undergoing cognitive testing for memory and focusing issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Deco, Karin Espiritu wrote, “Deco is cancer free; the best way to describe him in his own words would be ‘I am strong, and I am a very happy boy.’ He is happy because he does not have any more nausea or vomiting in the morning, no more shots, there is no more port and there is no more chemo that will burn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now he can run without pain in his legs that was caused by the cancer, his defenses have risen and now he can fight viruses and also infection like other children. As for now, his liver is healing. His liver was damaged by the chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I learned about his last oral chemotherapy in one of his appointment IV chemotherapy with his hematology-oncology clinic appointment in November. I was very surprised. His hematology-oncology group was also happy. It was there that his countdown began for his last oral chemotherapy. He would be able to ring the bell, which would mean ‘end of treatment.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a week before his appointment, Deco was hospitalized for neutrophenic fever as his neutrophils (part of the white blood cells) were quite low. His body started to get sick, and his last oral chemotherapy was canceled because his oncologist said his body would not resist more chemo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After two weeks, we started chemo again, but only half, but then the fever came back,” Karin Espiritu said, “but now with respiratory problems again, he was hospitalized and again they have to cancel his oral chemotherapy and cancel his surgery to remove his portal. At this point, everything was just so unreal to me, but I had faith that Deco would get better. Finally, everything ended in January. They were able to remove his port and got his last chemotherapy, and Deco finally got to ring the bell. He was cancer-free. We were very happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am a very happy mother. I am not afraid anymore for Deco to be around other kids. I know he is safe, and his body can now flight viruses. But there are moments that I worry that the cancer might come back. I’m also worried that he might get a fever and he will not be able to be treated by his group. He will be treated by his primary doctor, but I know Deco will be in good hands. I get very emotional and I can’t talk about everything we’ve been through without crying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deco is being treated every four weeks for six months, then every two to three months, then six months and finally every year until Deco reaches the age of 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="subscriber-only"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Meanwhile, Deco enjoys playing with his sister, brothers and friends,” Karin Espiritu said. “Deco is the sweetest and happiest boy ever. I believe that every child should enjoy life and be happy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But more research has shown that, actually, for most people, the cholesterol in eggs &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/wellness-us/nutrition/article-13101983/foods-high-fat-cholesterol-heart-health.html"&gt;has little effect on blood&lt;/a&gt; cholesterol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, factors like saturated and trans fats in the diet play a more significant role in heart disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shrimp and pork, Dr Levine added, are healthy &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14496553/I-admitted-hospital-eating-protein-weeks-reason-make-you-never-want-eat-steak-again.html"&gt;protein alternatives to red meat&lt;/a&gt; despite doctors’ warnings about their cholesterol and saturated fat contents, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And avocados similarly slammed for being high in fat, are full of healthy monosaturated fat that can lower LDL cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Coffee, maligned by some in the medical community for years due to caffeine’s ability to increase a person’s blood pressure and heart rate temporarily, posing a risk for someone with pre-existing high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But actually,’ Dr Levine &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drevanlevine/video/7460663938993212703"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, ‘all have been found not to be true.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cardiologists have long warned against cholesterol-rich and saturated fat foods but may have targeted the wrong ones. Dr Evan Levine of Mt Sinai Hospital highlighted five foods once discouraged for heart health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Coffee has long been criticized for temporarily raising blood pressure and heart rate, but research shows no significant link between coffee consumption and long-term hypertension risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shifts in thinking about foods – which are harmful and which are good – are due to evolving research surrounding fats and fat intake, particularly saturated fats, the growing emphasis on whole foods, understanding of the impact of ultra-processed foods, and the rise in more personalized diet and nutrition plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further, scientists have since collected decades-long study findings about the complex relationship between nutrition and heart disease, along with a laundry list of other health problems affecting every organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have vacillated more on coffee than on any other beverage over the past six decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Evidence pointing to its benefits and risks continues to pile up, causing people to wonder whether their daily cup could be putting their heart at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The caffeine in coffee has been found to have a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24203773/#:~:text=Though%20caffeine%20drinkers%20may%20exhibit,the%20BP%20effects%20of%20caffeine."&gt;minimal effect&lt;/a&gt; on blood pressure. In 2022, researchers in Korea reviewed 13 long-term studies with nearly 315,000 people and found no significant connection between coffee intake and &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.jkms.org/pdf/10.3346/jkms.2022.37.e332?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;high blood pressure risk&lt;/a&gt; overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine said: ‘Even the American Heart Association says it’s heart healthy. Just don’t add sugar and cream.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A black cup of coffee contains just a few calories and none of the added fat from cream or whole milk. Dairy, especially full-fat dairy, contains high amounts of saturated fat known to raise LDL cholesterol in the blood, which is linked to both heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For this reason, Dr Levine recommends holding the butter and the salt when making your morning eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nutrition science has changed in recent years as more experts and scientists acknowledge that blood cholesterol levels are mostly determined by the amount of fats and carbohydrates in the diet, not by dietary cholesterol such as that found in eggs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eggs cooked in olive or avocado oil are ‘loaded with nutrients, unsaturated fatty acids, and can actually increase your HDL [good] cholesterol.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cholesterol in the yolks, he added, has little to no impact on the cholesterol in the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘That was the fear for years,’ he said. ‘But guess what… It’s the stupid saturated fat that your liver takes up and makes cholesterol that causes your cholesterol to go up. Eating cholesterol may even reduce your liver from making it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cholesterol worries have also kept doctors from endorsing shellfish, especially shrimp, for years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While high in cholesterol, shellfish like shrimp, lobster, and crab do not have the same impact on blood cholesterol levels as foods high in saturated fats, like red meat or processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For most people, dietary cholesterol—such as that found in seafood and eggs — has a minimal effect on raising blood cholesterol compared to the amount of saturated and trans fats in their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pork is another healthy protein source often outshined by chicken. Leaner cuts like pork tenderloin and loin chops are relatively low in fat and can be part of a heart-healthy diet when consumed a few times per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating a pork tenderloin is nothing like eating bacon or sausage, which are processed with preservatives and sky-high amounts of added sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eating just one avocado a week cut the risk of heart disease by up to a fifth in a study of more than 100,000 people (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And unlike beef, which has a slightly higher saturated fat content, unprocessed pork is a healthy low-fat protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Avocado has also been maligned for its fat content, ‘but it contains lots of dietary fiber and what kind of fat? Unsaturated fats, especially the real healthy stuff, the monosaturated fats.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study published in 2022 in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.121.024014#:~:text=Clinical%20Perspective&amp;amp;text=In%202%20large%20US%20cohorts,disease%20and%20coronary%20heart%20disease."&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; followed more than 110,000 people for 30 years and found that eating at least one whole avocado each week reduced heart disease risk by 16 percent compared to those who did not eat any avocado.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk of coronary heart disease, a condition caused by the narrowing of arteries due to plaque build-up, was 21 percent lower in those who ate at least one avocado weekly than those who ate none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine said: ‘Replacing animal products like butter, cheese, or bacon with avocado – makes sense – is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘On top of an egg, on top of anything, a salad, a piece of chicken or pork, sounds good to me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 14:53:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Maternal diet and infant allergies: The avocado connection - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxORlBEZzBUSThoNHdmR1VFbnlqQWVoV0ZvREVSX2VxSERMRGxuV3l5bms0VWM1aE93S3pRNGVNc2FuRE13T2NIVG1pdU5mMXlvOUpkY29hZXZSZXJnVGVBQ1MwWVRPWi0yeUwwSzA1MzJrRkxncXI2WjM1UGUzdGdqa3JHVXVpOTR6REE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-byline text-low"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hass Avocado Board teamed up with the University of Eastern Finland researchers to examine the relationship between maternal avocado consumption during pregnancy and allergic outcomes in infants. Findings suggest that consuming avocados during pregnancy is associated with a 43.6% lower likelihood of food allergy development in children by 12 months of age.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Maternal dietary choices during pregnancy influence offspring health, particularly in the development of allergic diseases, including rhinitis, eczema, asthma, and food allergies. Prior research has explored the effects of maternal dietary patterns, identifying that proinflammatory diets may increase allergic disease risk, while Mediterranean-style diets appear protective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies on maternal nutrition have examined the role of fruits, vegetables, and specific food categories but lacked investigations into the impact of individual foods on allergy development in children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Avocado consumption during pregnancy linked to lower child food allergy risk: prospective KuBiCo study," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41390-025-03968-4" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Pediatric Research&lt;/i&gt;, the team conducted a prospective cohort study to assess how &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/avocado/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;avocado&lt;/a&gt; consumption during pregnancy relates to childhood allergy outcomes. Data were obtained from the Kuopio Birth Cohort (KuBiCo) Study, which included pregnant women giving birth at Kuopio University Hospital, Finland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 2,272 participants met the inclusion criteria for analysis. Avocado consumption was determined through an online food frequency questionnaire administered in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy. Participants were categorized as avocado consumers if they reported consuming any avocado (&amp;gt;0 grams) in at least one trimester, and non-consumers if they reported 0 grams in both trimesters. Offspring allergic outcomes—including rhinitis, paroxysmal wheezing, eczema, and food allergy—were assessed through a 12-month follow-up questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Logistic regression models analyzed the association between maternal avocado consumption and allergic health outcomes while adjusting for multiple covariates, including maternal age, education, BMI, delivery method, neonatal intensive care admission, breastfeeding duration, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/alcohol+consumption/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;, smoking status, and diet quality.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to children of avocado non-consumers, children of avocado consumers exhibited a significantly lower risk of food allergy (2.4% vs. 4.2%, p = 0.030). The association remained statistically significant even in fully adjusted models. No significant associations were found between maternal avocado intake and rhinitis, eczema, or paroxysmal wheezing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nutrient components of avocado, such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/monounsaturated+fats/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;monounsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt;, fiber, and antioxidants, may play a role in immune system development, yet the specific biological mechanisms require further investigation. Researchers suggest that long-term studies are needed to evaluate &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/allergy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;allergy&lt;/a&gt; risk beyond 12 months and determine whether avocado consumption has protective effects later in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting side note to the study is the mix of transparency and lack thereof within the disclosures. The Hass Avocado Board (HAB) defines itself as having a marketing and promotional role, stating on their website, "HAB is the only avocado organization that equips the entire global industry for success by collecting, focusing and distributing investments to maintain and expand demand for avocados in the United States."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;While the first two authors are clearly (and transparently) affiliated with HAB, there is zero conflict disclosure in the "Competing interests" section of the study. Additionally, the source of funding and the role of the funders for the present study seem to be left out. The Funding section of the paper only mentions the preexisting KuBiCo Study, not the current study's funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing wrong with conducting or publishing industry-funded research, but when funding and conflicts are left out or deemed unnecessary to the audience, it does start to blend with advertising in an uncomfortable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it is the journal &lt;i&gt;Pediatric Research&lt;/i&gt; and the publisher Springer Nature that need to maintain the standards of disclosure lest we take everything they publish with a pinch of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a pinch of salt also happens to be a terrific way to enjoy avocados.&lt;/p&gt;

She continued experiencing cramps, pains and occasional bouts of diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I was like something’s weird with my stomach, but maybe I still have some lingering effects of the norovirus or the flu, or maybe I ate something,” the 36-year-old from Wheaton, Illinois, tells TODAY.com. “I just kept feeling not very well.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After an ultrasound, she was diagnosed with a cyst, but her symptoms continued, and a CT scan detected inflammation in Wozniak’s bowel. A colonoscopy found that she had cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“(The doctor) says, ‘Yeah, you have two masses in your colon that are cancerous,” she recalls. “It was quite a shock.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;'I wasn't feeling normal' &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In February 2024, Wozniak contracted the norovirus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It was vomiting, diarrhea,” she says. “It was pretty graphic and bad.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-05-6c98a4.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-05-6c98a4.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-05-6c98a4.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-05-6c98a4.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-05-6c98a4.jpg" alt="Jessica Wozniak"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;After Jessica Wozniak experienced stomach cramping for months, doctors found that she had Stage 4 colon cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Jessica Wozniak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While she slowly began feeling better, she never completely rebounded and “wasn't feeling normal in my digestive system,” she explains. Wozniak and her husband were planning on having another child to join their daughter, and Wozniak had stopped taking her birth control pills. She wondered if that contributed to how she felt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“These things all happened at the same time,” she says. “I gave it a couple of weeks.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Her GI symptoms lingered and worsened. When she had a telehealth visit in April, she mentioned them to her doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I said, ‘Gosh, I’m getting stomach cramps every morning. While I was eating breakfast, I just doubled over with cramps,’” Wozniak recalls. “They asked me some questions and were like, ‘Oh, it could be ovarian cysts. I think you should go get a CT.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Wozniak went to the emergency room, and the wait time was so long that she decided to schedule with one of her providers and went to the midwife group who delivered her daughter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They were a little bit dismissive, like, ‘Well, yeah, this is an ovarian cyst. That sounds exactly what it is. It’s going to be a lot of pain. You probably have gas pain, too,’” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;They ordered an ultrasound and assured her the cysts would “rupture of go away on their own” and she would be “fine.” The technician detected an ovarian cyst but noticed something on the ultrasound on her left side but felt unsure of what it was. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At one point after that visit, it seemed like the cyst had burst because Wozniak experienced “terrible pain.” But her stomach cramps never improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Every time I had to have a bowel movement, it was pain, it was cramping,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Her primary care doctor ordered a CT, which found bowel inflammation. That prompted a colonoscopy. Even still, the doctor didn’t seem overly worried. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The gastroenterologist was like, ‘I don’t think this is cancer,’” Wozniak says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But when she woke from her colonoscopy, Wozniak learned she did have cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I was diagnosed early June of 2024 with colon cancer,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While Wozniak knew her paternal grandparents had colon cancer, they were in their 60s when they were diagnosed. Her paternal aunt learned she had colon cancer at 47, and Wozniak's father received a colon cancer diagnosis around the same time as Wozniak. It wasn’t until she was diagnosed that she learned there could be a genetic link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“No one had ever told me that there was a genetic test I could do,” she says. “I was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Lynch syndrome is an inherited genetic mutation that increases one’s risk of developing a variety of early-onset cancers, including colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s still a shock to me that … this didn’t cross anyone’s mind, and here I was at 35 being diagnosed with Stage 4 (colon cancer),” she says. “This really shouldn’t happen. We should have known. There’s things out there to learn about sooner.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-04-6f0594.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-04-6f0594.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-04-6f0594.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-04-6f0594.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-04-6f0594.jpg" alt="Jessica Wozniak"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Jessica Wozniak enjoys riding horses and did it as much as she could before her diagnosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Jessica Wozniak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/cancer-rising-young-people-lynch-syndrome-rcna100443" target="_blank"&gt;People with Lynch syndrome&lt;/a&gt; often undergo a variety of cancer screenings in an effort to detect any cancers at an earlier stage, and they also might receive different treatment after diagnosis. For example, Dr. Matthew Yurgelun previously told TODAY.com that immunotherapies — treatments that bolster the immune system to fight the cancer — work “exceptionally well,” in many Lynch syndrome-related cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Wozniak’s doctors recommended a treatment plan that included four rounds of two immunotherapy drugs, which she began in July. A CT scan after those treatments showed that her liver metastases, were shrinking but another mass in her sigmoid colon appeared to be growing. Her doctors wanted to shrink and reduce most of her masses so they could perform surgery with clear margins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“My doctor’s recommendations was to continue the immunotherapy and add on chemotherapy,” Wozniak says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But before Wozniak could start the new treatment, her insurance at the time, Cigna, denied it and recommended that she only do chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They said, ‘No, no, no, immunotherapy is not working,’” she says. “My doctor said, ‘It is. Here’s the scan that shows the liver (masses) getting smaller.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Wozniak learned she could appeal, but she felt stunned by her insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I thought, ‘Who are you to decide that for me? You’re not my doctor,’” she says. “It made me really upset. It made me really angry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She and her family took to social media to ask what she could do, and people offered suggestions, including working with her human resources department at work on the appeal, which she did. She also reached out to the pharmaceutical company asking if she could pay for it directly. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/consumer/woman-denied-stage-4-colon-cancer-treatment-finds-ally-in-her-hr-department/3666321/?_osource=sm_npd_nbc_nat_tod_gen" target="_blank"&gt;NBC Chicago&lt;/a&gt; covered her story in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Wozniak soon learned her treatment would be covered by her insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-03-83c6b1.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-03-83c6b1.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-03-83c6b1.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-03-83c6b1.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-03-83c6b1.jpg" alt="Jessica Wozniak"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Jessica Wozniak learned that she had Lynch syndrome, a inherited genetic mutation that causes people to develop certain cancers and at a younger age. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Jessica Wozniak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cigna provided TODAY.com with a statement: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We have developed clinical guidelines to ensure that all patients receive safe and appropriate care. Our guidelines are based on published medical literature, leading clinical experts, and for oncology, the guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Our physicians work collaboratively with treating physicians to adapt these guidelines to each person’s unique health needs and circumstances. Patients and their physicians can ask for expedited reviews for urgent needs, which are completed within 72 hours. Our processes worked as intended for Ms. Wozniak and her treatment was approved within 24 hours.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;'You really have to speak up' &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Wozniak is undergoing her eighth round of treatment. Afterward, doctors want to perform an MRI to see how the masses have responded. There’s a tumor near her pelvic wall that doctors worry they cannot yet remove with clean margins. Since July, she’s hoped that she could undergo surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They’ll remove the majority of my colon except a small piece at the end and they’ll re-route my small intestine to take over that bit,” she says. She will likely also undergo a combination of resection and ablation in her liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Wozniak has six masses in her liver, but the surgeon believes they can be addressed. At some point, she will have a hysterectomy because Lynch syndrome can cause uterine cancers, and she’ll also have her fallopian tubes removed to protect against ovarian cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-02-1c0148.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-02-1c0148.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-02-1c0148.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-02-1c0148.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Jessica-Wozniak-colon-cancer-mc-250311-02-1c0148.jpg" alt="Jessica Wozniak"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Having the support of her family while undergoing treatment has helped Jessica Wozniak grapple with some of the tough things she's faced.

Here’s how to protect yourself.(Image by Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Rajiv Kovil, Head of Diabetology at Zandra Healthcare and Co-Founder of Rang De Neela Initiative, claimed, “Early identification of kidney disease in diabetes is crucial to delay its progression to kidney failure and most people with kidney disease in diabetes eventually die of heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="shortEntryContainer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He explained, “Podocytes are specialised cells in the kidney's tissue, which is called the glomerular, which play a critical role in maintaining the filtration barrier. In T2DM, persistent hyperglycemia leads to podocyte injury, loss, and ultimately, resulting in protein leaking in urine . Podocyte loss is an early marker of diabetic kidney disease, often preceding a significant reduction in kidney function.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_640x362/HT/p2/2016/04/10/Pictures/diabetes_f111cd5e-fefe-11e5-b2cb-21770897bf70.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Diabetic kidney disease is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease, and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.(Shutterstock)" title="Diabetic kidney disease is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease, and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Diabetic kidney disease is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease, and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Rajiv Kovil elaborated, "The Urinary Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (UACR) is a key diagnostic marker that can detect early kidney damage. An elevated UACR (&amp;gt;30 mg/g) suggests albuminuria, which is indicative of early kidney disease. Early identification of elevated UACR enables timely therapeutic intervention to prevent progression to kidney failure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Early treatment strategies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Rajiv Kovil, early treatment strategies aimed at reducing UACR can significantly slow kidney disease progression -&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Patients with diabetic kidney disease often present with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) or diabetic macular edema (DME), and vice versa. Managing blood pressure, blood glucose, and kidney function concurrently can reduce the risk of retinopathy progression in diabetic patients with CKD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have emerged as a revolutionary class of drugs in managing both diabetes and CKD. SGLT2 inhibitors, such as empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and canagliflozin, work by blocking glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, leading to glucose excretion and osmotic diuresis This mechanism results in reduced intraglomerular pressure, thereby protecting the kidneys from progressive damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD with diabetes:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Reduction in Albuminuria: Studies like the EMPA-KIDNEY and DAPA-CKD trials demonstrated significant reductions in albuminuria, thereby slowing CKD progression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2. Preservation of Kidney Function: Long-term use of SGLT2 inhibitors reduces the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3. Cardiovascular Protection: SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce cardiovascular events, a major cause of mortality in diabetic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4. Delaying Dialysis or Kidney Failure: By reducing intraglomerular pressure, SGLT2 inhibitors help delay the onset of ESRD.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Rajiv Kovil asserted, “Chronic kidney disease remains a major complication of type 2 Diabetes, with significant morbidity and mortality. Early detection through UACR and managing proteinuria are essential strategies to slow kidney function decline.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_630x354/HT/p2/2017/02/14/Pictures/_7f58aeb8-f277-11e6-bee8-7b74d3637aa8.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Deficiency in anti-ageing hormone, called Klotho, could have a reason to play in diabetic patients getting kidney diseases.(Shutterstock)" title="Deficiency in anti-ageing hormone, called Klotho, could have a reason to play in diabetic patients getting kidney diseases.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Deficiency in anti-ageing hormone, called Klotho, could have a reason to play in diabetic patients getting kidney diseases.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He concluded, “The advent of SGLT2 inhibitors has revolutionised the management of diabetic kidney disease by reducing albuminuria, preserving renal function and offering cardiovascular protection. As the burden of diabetes rises in India, widespread adoption of SGLT2 inhibitors, routine screening, and early intervention can substantially reduce the progression of CKD in diabetes, improving patient outcomes and quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;McAllen, Texas (seen here), is the most obese city in America, researchers at WalletHub found in a new study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rankings come as a record &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14110115/record-adults-obese-overweight-map-fattest-areas.html"&gt;three in four Americans are now considered overweight or obese&lt;/a&gt;, according to the latest CDC data.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chip Lupo, analyst at financial firm WalletHub, who conducted the research, said: 'Obesity is becoming more and more prevalent in the US, and it’s costing us big time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In the most overweight and obese cities, residents often lack easy access to healthy food and recreation opportunities, so investing in those areas should help improve people’s diets and exercise regimens, and reduce the financial burden overall.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;WalletHub compared 100 of the most populated cities in the US across three metrics: overweight and obesity, health consequences, and food and fitness.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team then looked at the share of overweight children, teenagers, and adults in each area, as well as projected obesity rates by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health consequences measured included high cholesterol, high blood pressure, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-c8c709f0-010f-11f0-8e91-c5e380c9c419"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease, and obesity-related deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also evaluated how many residents had access to healthy foods like fruits and vegetables, as well as parks and recreational facilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The data was sourced from the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-c8c646a0-010f-11f0-8e91-c5e380c9c419"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, the US Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, USDA, and county health rankings, among others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team assigned scores to each metric, with a higher score indicating a worse ranking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;McAllen was crowned the most obese city with a score of 85. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found that 45 percent of its adults are obese and another 31 percent are overweight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;McAllen also has the second-highest share of obese teenagers and the fifth-highest share of obese children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The city has the eighth-highest amount of people with diabetes and the fourth-highest heart disease rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said this could be due to McAllen having the highest rate of physical inactivity in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team wrote: 'That may not be entirely their fault, considering McAllen has the second-lowest percentage of residents who live close to parks or recreational facilities.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The WalletHub rankings come as three in four Americanas are now overweight or obese (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers believe McAllen, which sits on the southern border with Mexico, is the most obese city due to low exercise rates and a lack of access to healthy foods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Honolulu, Hawaii (seen here), is the least obese city. The researchers said this is likely due to abundant access to healthy foods and high rates of physical activity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Little Rock, Arkansas, scored an 84 and took second place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said this was due to the 203,000-person city having the fourth-highest rate of obesity among children ages 10-17, 23 percent, with nearly another 17 percent of young people being overweight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Little Rock also has the fourth-highest percentage of adults with high blood pressure and also the fifth-highest heart disease rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers attributed Little Rock's obesity problem to it having the second-least amount of health educators per capita and limited access to healthy foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said: 'The problem will likely remain for the foreseeable future, too, as Little Rock has the second-highest projected obesity rate for 2030.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jackson, Mississippi, was the third fattest city in the US, moving down one spot from second place &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13197683/america-obese-cities-study-rates.html"&gt;this time last year&lt;/a&gt;. The area scored 83.4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 37 percent of adults in the 150,000-person city are considered obese, and Jackson has the second-highest percentage of adults who have had a stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, nearly 37 percent of adults have high blood pressure, raising their risk of heart attacks and strokes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'Not exercising regularly is a big reason why many of Jackson’s residents are overweight and obese. The city has the second-highest rates of physically inactive adults, and many residents lack easy access to healthy food.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mobile, Alabama, and Knoxville, Tennessee, rounded out the top five, both scoring 83.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both cities had the two highest 'health consequences' rank, which is based on the amount of adults with high cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and deaths from obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Honolulu, Hawaii, was deemed the least obese city in America with a score of 59. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found the 1million residents in the metro area had the greatest access to healthy food and exercise of all 100 cities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The area also had the fourth-lowest rate of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes and sixth-lowest obesity rate.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="health" id="mol-1bb07980-032c-11f0-8603-b716014ba0ee"&gt;

When he stuffed some paper towels inside and smeared them around, he was in for a shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The towels were white – until I pulled them out," says Behnke, an expert in food safety at Purdue University in Indiana, US. "I realised that the slippery sensation I felt in the interior of the bottle was not because of the material but rather because of a bacterial build-up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;His next step was to design a study. Behnke and colleagues &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.foodprotection.org/members/fpt-archive-articles/2017-11-the-cleanliness-of-reusable-water-bottles-how-contamination-levels-are-affected-by-bottle-us/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;stopped passers-by in a corridor&lt;/a&gt; at Purdue and asked if they would be happy to loan their water bottles to them as part of their research – to see how clean they were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"One thing that stood out from the project was the number of people who didn't want to know the results," recalls Behnke. "Basically, they knew that their cleaning habits were poor to non-existent – something the data later confirmed." The results &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.foodprotection.org/members/fpt-archive-articles/2017-11-the-cleanliness-of-reusable-water-bottles-how-contamination-levels-are-affected-by-bottle-us/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;confirmed that those bottles were brimming with bacteria.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But while they help people to stay hydrated, drinking from water bottles regularly, and taking them with us everywhere we go, may also pose health risks. So, should we ditch them, or can those risks be managed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="what-exactly-is-inside-reusable-water-bottles?" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="what-exactly-is-inside-reusable-water-bottles?" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;What exactly is inside reusable water bottles?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While it's usually safe to drink, water from our kitchen taps is not devoid of microbial life. This is why leaving water in your bottle for a few days will encourage bacteria to grow, says Primrose Freestone, associate professor in clinical microbiology at the University of Leicester, in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Bacteria that can cause human infections thrives at around 37C (98F) Freestone says, but it can also multiply at room temperature, around 20C (68F).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The longer water in a bottle is stored at room temperature, the more bacteria will grow," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;One study conducted in Singapore using boiled tap water – which should have killed most bacteria in it – found that bacteria populations can grow rapidly inside water bottles as they are used throughout an average day. On average they found that reusable bottles used by adults went from around 75,000 bacteria per millilitre in mid-morning to more &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.civilenvironjournal.com/fulltext/acee/pdf/acee-aid1007.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;1-2 million per millilitre&lt;/a&gt; over the course of 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kypjy8.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kypjy8.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kypjy8.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kypjy8.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kypjy8.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kypjy8.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kypjy8.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kypjy8.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kypjy8.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kypjy8.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Gorka Olmo Every sip you take from a water bottle or even a glass can leave microbes behind that mingle with those already in the liquid (Credit: Gorka Olmo)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Gorka Olmo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Every sip you take from a water bottle or even a glass can leave microbes behind that mingle with those already in the liquid (Credit: Gorka Olmo)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;One way to slow bacterial growth down is to store your bottle in the fridge between sips, Freestone says, though this doesn't stop it from growing altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But while some of a water bottle's bacterial activity comes from the water itself, most contamination is actually introduced by the drinker. Whether you take your bottle to work, the gym, or even just keep it in the house, the outside of your bottle will carry many microbes. And these microbes are easily transferred into the contents of the bottle, along with bacteria from your mouth every time you take a sip, Freestone says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Water bottle users who don't wash their hands regularly will also find that their bottles can harbour bacteria such as &lt;i id="e.-coli" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, Freestone says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Poo-associated bacteria, such as &lt;i id="e.-coli" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, can come from our hands and end up on our lips if we're not good at toilet hygiene," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;People generally have between 500 and 600 different species of bacteria living in their mouths says Freestone. "What isn't necessarily disease-causing for you isn't always the case for others. You can carry an infection and not realise it, because our immune systems are so good at protecting us," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Another way you can encourage bacterial growth in your bottle is by putting anything other than fresh water in them. Drinks that nourish you also feed microbes – so any drinks containing sugar, for example, can stimulate the growth of any bacteria or mould present in your bottle, Freestone says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Anything other than water is heaven for bacteria and fungi, especially protein shakes," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;If you've ever left milk in a glass for a few hours, you may have noticed that it leaves behind a thin film on the glass when you pour it away. Bacteria happen to adore this film, Freestone says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="how-can-this-bacteria-affect-us?" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="how-can-this-bacteria-affect-us?" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;How can this bacteria affect us?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Water that's been contaminated with bacteria such as &lt;i id="e.-coli" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; can cause diarrhoea and vomiting but not all the time. &lt;i id="e.-coli" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;E.

It is only when the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro818" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;bacteria turn pathogenic&lt;/a&gt; – in other words they pick up certain traits that make them harmful – that they make people ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;Behnke and his colleagues also suggest using a dishwasher with a sanitisation cycle could be the most effective approach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Our guts are changing all the time, but there are over 1,000 species present in the gut so it's hard to shift in terms of composition," says Freestone. "There are too many variables to say, but getting food poisoning from the bacteria in a water bottle will never lead to a positive change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;People who've recently taken antibiotics that can affect their gut microbiome can also experience changes that leave them more vulnerable to other infections. One swab of a reusable water bottle taken at a newspaper office in the UK also revealed that these bottles can be a breeding ground for emerging strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Researchers &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mbo3.1023" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;discovered a bacterium called &lt;i id="klebsiella-grimontii" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Klebsiella grimontii&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;– which is capable of forming biofilms on otherwise sterile surface –in the sample taken from the water bottle. While it can be found as part of the normal microflora of the gastrointestinal tract, it can also cause severe diarrhoea in people who have recently taken antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It's worth noting, however, there are no examples of severe illness that have been traced back to reusable water bottles in the scientific literature. This doesn't mean they don't happen, of course, as identifying &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/205/11/1639/844906?redirectedFrom=fulltext" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;single point sources&lt;/a&gt; of infection is notoriously difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="how-should-we-clean-reusable-bottles?" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="how-should-we-clean-reusable-bottles?" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;How should we clean reusable bottles?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;For Behnke, it was the creeping sense that he should perhaps be cleaning his own water bottle more thoroughly that made him look closer at what could be inside it. He'd been using a filtered water bottle and had started to notice that the water he was drinking from it tasted bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Every now and then I would flush it with hot water, but never really did anything more than that," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;After his paper towel-based investigations revealed how manky his water bottle was, the study he and colleagues carried out went on to look at people's water bottle habits in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Behnke found that just over half of the 90 participants surveyed during the research said they share their bottle with others, and 15% said they never cleaned their bottles. Unsurprisingly, whether or not people rinsed or washed their water bottles affected the contamination level. However, Behnke found that how often they cleaned the bottles, or how they cleaned them, didn't enormously affect how contaminated the containers were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;People who washed their bottle with tools such as a brush or used a dishwasher tended to have the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.foodprotection.org/members/fpt-archive-articles/2017-11-the-cleanliness-of-reusable-water-bottles-how-contamination-levels-are-affected-by-bottle-us/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;lowest counts of bacteria inside&lt;/a&gt;. Behnke and his colleagues also suggest using a dishwasher with a sanitisation cycle could be the most effective approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, the study's conclusion states that these findings may have been skewed by the fact the researchers were relying on participants self-reporting their cleaning behaviours, and they may have changed their answers to appear more socially acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The study also found that bottles containing tea, coffee or juice were more contaminated than bottles that only contained water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kypk6b.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kypk6b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kypk6b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kypk6b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kypk6b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kypk6b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kypk6b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kypk6b.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kypk6b.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kypk6b.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Gorka Olmo Storing your water bottle in the fridge between sips can be one way to slow down microbial growth (Credit: Gorka Olmo)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Gorka Olmo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Storing your water bottle in the fridge between sips can be one way to slow down microbial growth (Credit: Gorka Olmo)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Cleaning our water bottles regularly and properly is the only way to be confident you are not consuming harmful bacteria alongside your water.

The most hygienic bottles are simply those that are the easiest to clean, Freestone says.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stretching, drinking water, getting outside and eating breakfast are some habits that may help with healthy aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These habits can help you maintain your health and independence in the decades to come. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look for ways to improve your lifestyle that excite you and bring you joy. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Long gone are the days when celebrating 50 years around the sun was something to be feared. From changing careers to checking off places on their travel bucket lists, women across the globe are living their best lives beyond 50. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to thriving in—and well past—your 50s, a strong foundation built around a balanced diet, regular movement and mindfulness is key. “Don’t let your age define you! You can feel just as capable and energetic at 50 as you did at 30 as long as you take care of your body and manage stress. But, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7920294/foods-to-eat-every-day-for-brain-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-8737183" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;bone health&lt;/a&gt; are things that we need to start focusing on more as we age,” says registered dietitian &lt;a href="http://www.franceslargemanroth.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Frances Largeman-Roth,&lt;/a&gt; a nutrition expert and author of &lt;em&gt;Everyday Snack Tray&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To help keep your health at its best and embrace the decades to come, nutrition experts—all of whom are over 50—recommend doing these six things every morning. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-start-with-a-gentle-stretch"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Start with a Gentle Stretch  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s a reason mobility and flexibility training programs are on the rise. According to sports dietitian &lt;a href="https://activeeatingadvice.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Leslie Bonci, M.P.H., CSSD,&lt;/a&gt; owner of Active Eating Advice, “Stretching is important at all ages. Stretching for flexibility sets the stage for being protective of our supporting structure as we age. If we don’t use it, we lose it.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Depending on your fitness level, the type of mobility exercises you do—or how far you can lean into the stretch—may differ, but don’t let your current level of flexibility keep you from stretching. Research shows that a regular stretching routine can improve mobility and balance and reduce the risk of falls as you age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you follow a five-minute video on YouTube or try &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8030090/best-stretches-for-better-sleep/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;this simple routine&lt;/a&gt;, set aside a few minutes each morning to warm up your body and reach for your toes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-hydrate"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Hydrate  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While you’re getting your coffee ready in the morning, make sure to drink at least one cup of water. Getting in the habit of staying hydrated in your 50s is crucial for aging well in your 60s, 70s and beyond. In fact, studies show that most older adults are not meeting their hydration needs, which can increase the risk of medical complications and lengthen hospital stays.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Why hydrate first thing in the morning? “Starting the day with water restocks, restores and replenishes fluid levels, benefiting the body and brain. Hydration never takes a vacation and is important at all ages. Do not wait until later in the day to start drinking, as it can affect concentration levels over the day, making you feel more fatigued and less energetic,” says Bonci.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you’ve had your H2O, feel free to grab that warm mug of coffee. “Now that I’m over 50, I feel extra good about my morning cup of joe. Not only does coffee help us feel alert and focused, it’s actually good for our brains. Research shows that caffeine intake is associated with the prevention of cognitive decline and can help lower the risk of developing Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and stroke,” says Largeman-Roth. In fact, a review confirmed this, finding that older adults who regularly consumed coffee were less likely to have negative physical outcomes, like limited mobility and age-related muscle loss, than non-coffee drinkers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s something to be said about starting your day with a breath of fresh air, especially if it’s sunny out. Research shows that regular sun exposure is beneficial for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8034163/benefits-vitamin-d/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D production&lt;/a&gt;, regulating your circadian rhythm and improving your mood.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even when weather isn’t in your favor, getting outside—and leaving your phone on the nightstand—can go a long way in boosting your mood and reducing stress.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Every morning I wake up early to walk my dogs and leave my phone at home. I go when the sun rises so I can be in the moment, appreciate nature and focus on the positivity in my life. Whatever way you want to enjoy your moment, do it daily,” says &lt;a href="http://www.tobyamidornutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Toby Amidor, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, an award-winning nutrition expert and author of &lt;em&gt;Health Shots&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By the time you reach 50, perimenopause and menopause are on the horizon, if they haven’t already knocked on your door. Staying physically active is one of the best ways to maintain a healthy weight and support bone health during this phase of significant hormonal changes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To ensure that life stressors don’t get in the way of a workout, try scheduling your sweat session first thing in the morning. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you take your dogs for a long walk, boot up an online workout class or head to a local Pilates studio, it’s important to engage in moderate to vigorous exercise at least three times per week. Largeman-Roth agrees, saying, “On most mornings, I head to the basement for a spin class or a strength workout on the app. Keeping my heart healthy and my bones and muscles strong is important for my health and balance.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-eat-a-balanced-breakfast"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Eat a Balanced Breakfast  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dietitians unanimously agree on the power of a balanced breakfast to support your health, especially as you age. “I don’t have a large appetite in the morning, but [I] do make sure to get in protein and produce. Starting the day strong keeps us feeling fuller throughout the day. Plus, including fruits and veggies at breakfast helps to meet daily fiber goals, supporting the microbiome and overall gut health,” says Bonci.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Breakfast is also an important opportunity for getting key nutrients your body needs for healthy aging, like calcium, vitamin D and protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While mornings can be hectic, when possible, make a point to slow down and actually enjoy your A.M. meal. “I like eating breakfast and making time to sit down daily and enjoy it—even if it’s a bowl of cereal and milk topped with fruit. It’s a nice way to savor every bite and eat mindfully,” says Amidor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-meal-plan-for-better-brain--bone-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Meal-Plan for Better Brain &amp;amp; Bone Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Strong bones and a sharp mind are key for a long and healthy life. Planning your meals first thing in the morning can help ensure you’re eating brain- and bone-supporting foods throughout the day. For example, salmon and walnuts are rich in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026789/best-nutrient-for-brain-health-as-you-age/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 acids for brain health&lt;/a&gt;, while prunes contain minerals essential for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-8737183" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;bone health&lt;/a&gt;. Largeman-Roth agrees, saying, “I eat a handful of prunes each morning to keep my bones strong and my gut healthy. I throw them into &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-fruits-you-should-add-to-smoothies-8675944" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;smoothies &lt;/a&gt;and dice them up to add to yogurt or on top of oatmeal. They’re delicious and such an easy way to boost my health!” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Planning out your meals can also help you make more healthful choices and minimize mindless snacking—something that Amidor notes can be especially tricky during perimenopause, thanks to shifts in appetite. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nutrition experts agree that focusing on a healthy lifestyle is key for maintaining your health well into your 50s and beyond. Experts recommend adopting habits like stretching, soaking up sunlight, drinking water, planning your meals and sitting down to a balanced breakfast first thing in the morning to start your day off on the right foot. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to exercise, diet and stress management, Amidor encourages you to explore what really lights your fire and excites you. “This is the time to find joy in your life—even the smallest things. So if cooking, running, eating a small treat or enjoying the sunrise brings you joy—then do it!” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;

Two of the papers came from the lab of Pascal Geldsetzer at Stanford University. Analysing medical records from Britain and Australia, the researchers concluded that around a fifth of dementia diagnoses could be averted through the original shingles vaccine, which contains live varicella-zoster virus. Two other studies, one by &lt;small&gt;GSK&lt;/small&gt;, a pharmaceutical company, and another by a group of academics in Britain, also reported that a newer “recombinant” vaccine, which is more effective at preventing shingles than the live version, appeared to confer even greater protection against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economist</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 13:56:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxPbUZqMnVaczFSaFhMN1hvY20xMXFPT2VwOEhxaU0tZWpWM2sza1pfTGpOcEpoS0RwU0ozZ3lWR3FyOXBhb3dRaEQ4d2diTHlIWXRJQU94R1hBWVpQeVlZV3NyVDA3MFZ1bXZDV0c5ZnhFLTBFVHJFbU5WQlBHUVZaVFhsSkt5QXBCb3NPQ2o2ZHozbEE</guid></item><item><title>'I Eat 130 Grams Of Protein Per Day.

(While the recommended daily allowance of protein has long been much lower at.36 grams of protein per pound of total body weight, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a41958183/how-much-proten-do-you-need/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:experts are now agreeing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;experts are now agreeing&lt;/a&gt; that highly active folks are better off with much more than that to support tissue growth.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, one doesn’t consume 130 grams of protein each and every day by simply scarfing &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/g44388613/best-protein-bar/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein bars;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein bars&lt;/a&gt; and whey shakes. It requires a purposefully planned diet rich in whole food protein sources, as well as an array of nutrient-dense vegetables, fruits, and starches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Women’s Health&lt;/em&gt; asked Meg to take us on an imaginary spin through her local grocery store to find out what she buys to meet her #gainsgoals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Meg Gallagher’s Meal Prep Game Plan&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meg shops once a week for enough groceries to prepare quick breakfasts and lunches, 2-3 home-cooked dinners (she makes four or more servings at a time to eat for lunch and dinner throughout the rest of the week), and snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She starts her trip around the perimeter of the store, where fresh ingredients such as produce and protein heavy-hitters like meat and dairy are stocked. Then she works her way into the aisles to grab frozen and packaged foods that supplement her beef, salmon, and eggs in meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a busy mom, Meg says she doesn't turn her nose up at boxed food either. “If I need to sneak in some processed foods to reach my goals or for my enjoyment, that's my business,” she says with a laugh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Grid Vongpiansuksa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;First Stop Is The Produce Aisle&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, Meg actually doesn't count the small amount of protein in fruits and vegetables towards her overall goal, so her personal produce choices are more about what will support the star of her plate: the meat. (And, often, her produce comes in the form of bags of frozen vegetables rather than fresh. More on that below.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when she does plan a meal around a produce item—like her beloved avocado toast—she adds protein, such as an egg, to amp up her grams. The same thing goes for salad—she’ll buy a 50/50 super greens mix for the base and supplement with slices of grilled steak on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to snacks, endless fruit-and-veggie chopping isn't exactly feasible with a toddler in tow, so Meg gravitates towards “grab-and-go” items like bananas, baby carrots, and celery that she can munch on throughout the day, with little prep required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Next Up, The Protein MVP: Meat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meg is a creature of habit when it comes to her butcher-block buys. She always loads up on ground protein, either beef or chicken, since both are so versatile. She'll either cook the ground meat with a bag of veggies and rice, or mix it into pasta accompanied by sauce. (She’s currently obsessed with spaghetti bolognese.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her other meat staples are usually chicken or salmon. (Given salmon’s short shelf life, she often stocks up and stores it in her freezer.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;After Meat Selection Comes The Dairy Aisle&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a huge dairy person,” Meg says. “It’s how I hit my protein.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For milk, Meg opts for an ultra-filtered 2% version from Fairlife. “The price is a little higher, but I think it's worth it,” she says. “It filters out the lactose and also some carbs and fats that are typically found in milk. It is a higher protein milk for the amount of calories that you're getting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given her love affair with spaghetti bolognese, Meg also grabs fat-free shredded mozzarella cheese to sprinkle on her pasta. (“Fat-free helps me reach my protein goal without overdoing my fat because I get fat from other sources,” Meg explains.) String cheese is a necessity for snacking, as are yogurt and cottage cheese. Though she leans towards lower fat options for cheese, Meg prefers a higher fat Greek yogurt (5%) for the taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She finishes out the dairy section with a carton of eggs. (Meg's husband eats a lot of them, so she usually buys a pack of 18.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Once The Fresh Finds Are Gathered, It’s Time For The Interior Aisles&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her cart full of fresh finds from the perimeter of the store, Meg next works her way through the aisles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is where I’m choosing things that are nice alternatives that add a little bit of extra protein or nutrients,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, she stops by the pasta section to grab either chickpea noodles or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodles.com%2Fproducts%2Flucky-penne%2F&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Ffood%2Fa64205718%2F130-grams-a-day-protein-groceries%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Goodles;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Goodles&lt;/a&gt; (super-charged macaronis and penne that boast 10 grams of protein). Another carbohydrate option she likes that has some extra dietary heft: &lt;a href="https://www.daveskillerbread.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dave’s Killer Bread;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dave’s Killer Bread&lt;/a&gt;, which includes 21 whole grains and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the canned foods section, she gets jarred tomato sauce as well as black beans if she’s planning to make something like tacos or chili.

                                        &lt;p&gt;Dr Eric Berg, a renowned health expert, is advising people who consistently wake up between 2-3 am to consult a doctor, as this could be a sign of an underlying health issue. In a recent video on his YouTube channel, which has over 13 million subscribers, Dr Berg explains that cortisol levels, triggered by stress, typically drop to their lowest point around 2 am. However, if cortisol spikes instead, it can disrupt sleep patterns and cause nocturnal awakenings, potentially impacting daily routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's unique about 2 am is something called the circadian rhythm with cortisol. Cortisol should be at the lowest point in this rhythm at 2 am and the highest point at 8 am. For me everything was backwards I was very awake at 2 am, but I was extremely tired at 8am. I tried everything, I even tried prescription medications, but it didn't work. What I didn't know at the time was those medications worsen and raise your cortisol," he explained in the video shared on YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the video here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Berg suggested that magnesium can help regulate cortisol levels and alleviate stress. He further emphasised the importance of consulting a medical professional if magnesium deficiency is suspected, as it can disrupt both cortisol balance and sleep patterns. Sharing his personal experience with sleep struggles, Dr Berg highlighted the potential benefits of addressing magnesium levels to promote better rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="v-ndtv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explained that magnesium can help lower cortisol levels, and research supports this claim. Notably, a magnesium deficiency can lead to increased cortisol levels, making it more difficult to manage stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium also plays a crucial role in muscle relaxation, which can be disrupted by high cortisol levels. Additionally, magnesium is involved in regulating the nervous system, potentially leading to a calmer response to stress. However, a closer examination of the research reveals mixed findings, indicating a need for further studies to fully understand the relationship between magnesium, cortisol, and stress response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're watching right now and you have any tightness in your muscles - your upper back, lower back or if you point your toe and it cramps - that's a sure sign that you are deficient in magnesium. The type of magnesium that I would recommend taking is something called magnesium glycinate. It can help relax your muscles and reduce cortisol," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor recommended taking magnesium at night before bed. He explained that magnesium levels in the body's tissues are typically at their lowest around 6 am, which may contribute to the increased occurrence of health issues like heart attacks, strokes, and restless leg syndrome during the early morning hours, as these conditions are influenced by magnesium levels.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                                        
                                        
                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Measles outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico have led to &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/measles-cases-are-still-rising-in-texas-heres-what-you-should-know-about-the-contagious-virus/" class="content-link"&gt;nearly 300 cases&lt;/a&gt; and two deaths, raising public health concerns. Isolated cases have also been reported in a number of states, including Washington. Public Health — Seattle &amp;amp; King County last month &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/king-county-confirms-measles-case-public-warned-of-possible-exposure/" class="content-link"&gt;confirmed a case of measles in an infant&lt;/a&gt; who had traveled abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases come as public health experts have been increasingly concerned with falling childhood vaccination rates in the past several years, and of a growing anti-vaccination movement in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from the Washington State Department of Health shows that in 36 of the state’s 39 counties, the rate of vaccination against measles among kindergarten students fell from the 2019-20 to the 2023-24 school years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kindergartners are required to be fully vaccinated against measles through the MMR vaccine before school begins, though &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/community-and-environment/schools/immunization" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;state law&lt;/a&gt; allows parents or guardians to claim exemptions for religious or medical reasons. The kindergarten vaccination rate has declined across Washington, and quite sharply in some counties. And in the 2023-24 school year, kindergartners in only one Washington county met the herd-immunity threshold for measles of a 95% vaccination rate. Herd immunity occurs when the rate of vaccinations is high enough to stop an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="graphics-gallery-embed-1815355635" class="graphics-gallery-container mv-4 u-border-b u-border-t u-border-light-gray pv-3 column-width-embed graphics-gallery__captions-disabled"&gt;
      &lt;p class="graphics-gallery__headline h3 u-sans u-bold mh-auto"&gt;Measles vaccination rates down across WA&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p class="graphics-gallery__subhead u-sans mb-2 mh-auto"&gt;In 36 of Washington’s 39 counties, the rate of kindergartners vaccinated for measles declined from the 2019-20 to the 2023-24 school year.&lt;/p&gt;
      


      
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious virus, and it doesn’t take much for the spread of the disease to spiral out of control. Fortunately, the measles vaccine is effective at preventing disease, and it also provides long-lasting immunity. The vaccine is given in two shots, the first when the child is 12-15 months old, and the second at 4-6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King was among the counties where the measles vaccination rate dropped. In the 2023-24 school year, the most recent data available, around 20,500 of the 22,200 kindergartners had received both doses of the measles vaccine, for a rate of 92.2%. That figure has gradually declined since the 2019-20 school year, when it was above the herd-immunity threshold, at 95.6%. King County fell below the 95% mark in the 2021-2022 school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the more than 1,700 kindergartners in King County listed as not vaccinated against measles in the previous school year, the majority (64%) were out of compliance, meaning they hadn’t submitted proof of vaccination and hadn’t received an exemption. While 30% had received religious exemptions or religious membership exemptions and 2% had medical exemptions. Around 4% had conditional status, meaning they intended to complete the vaccination requirement but had not done so yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the school districts wholly in King County, Enumclaw had the lowest rate of kindergarten measles vaccine completions in the 2023-24 school year, at 83.9%. Vashon Island, which has &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/vashons-parents-try-to-get-along-despite-deep-vaccination-divide/" class="content-link"&gt;long been known&lt;/a&gt; for its low rate of vaccinations, was second lowest, 84.3%, followed by Tukwila at 86.3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mercer Island School District had the highest rate of kindergarten measles vaccinations in the past school year, at 97.3%, followed by Shoreline at 97.2% and Lake Washington at 96.9%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seattle Public Schools was below the 95% herd-immunity threshold at 93.1%. Seattle fell below the 95% mark in the 2021-22 school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles vaccination rates have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/13/upshot/vaccination-rates.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;fallen sharply&lt;/a&gt; in nearly every state since 2020. The decline has been linked to fallout from the pandemic, such as health concerns surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine and a decline in trust of public-health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest decline in kindergarten measles vaccinations among Washington counties was in rural Pend Oreille, in the northeast corner of the state, where the rate fell from 95.1% to 80% — a remarkable 15.1 percentage-point drop. Other large declines were in Pacific County, down 14 points, and Columbia County, down 12.9 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just two counties increased their rate of measles vaccine completions among kindergarten students from 2019-20 to 2023-24. Ferry County, in northeastern Washington, had the biggest jump, up 2.2 points. Even so, it still only had an 86.7% measles vaccination rate in the past school year. San Juan County had a small increase of less than one point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data wasn’t available for the 2019-20 school year for Wahkiakum County. According to the Department of Health, of the two schools in the county, one failed to report immunization numbers that year, and the other reported numbers with inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yakima County had the highest rate of kindergarten measles vaccinations in the 2023-24 school year, at 96.4%. It was, in fact, the only county where the rate exceeded the 95% herd-immunity threshold. That’s a big change from the 2019-20 school year, when 14 counties were above 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stevens County, in northeastern Washington, had the lowest rate of measles vaccinations among kindergartners, at 76.9%, and was one of two counties where the rate was below 80%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other was Jefferson County, where Port Townsend is located, with a rate of 79.2% in the last school year.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But how big a risk cannabis presents depends on the amount used and how much stock should be placed in observational studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between cannabinoids and cardiovascular disease, which used to be limited to evidence from preclinical studies, case reports, and case series, is now evident in epidemiological studies, researchers from Stanford reported in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41569-025-01121-6"&gt;a recent paper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature Reviews Cardiology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large-scale US study from 2024 relied on survey data from more than 430,000 respondents and found the 4% of respondents who reported using cannabis daily had a 49% increased risk for &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/155919-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;myocardial infarction&lt;/a&gt; and a twofold increased risk for &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1916852-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;. The added risk from cannabis was similar among those who also smoked tobacco and those who never used tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect was also dose dependent. Among weekly users, cannabis was associated with a 3% increased likelihood of heart attack and a 5% increased risk for stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart Attack and Stroke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings echo another Stanford University study from 2022, which analyzed UK Biobank data from 500,000 participants aged 40 years, and found those who reported smoking cannabis were significantly more likely to have a heart attack than compared with nonusers (53% vs 45%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several studies have found an association between arrhythmia, especially &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/151066-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt;, and cannabis use. A study published last year in the &lt;em&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/em&gt; showed the risk for new onset arrhythmia in the first 180 days was 0.8% among more than 5000 patients who had filled a cannabis prescription vs 0.4% for control participants, matched according to age, sex, and the use of other pain medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although cannabis contains 100t cannabinoids, research from cell culture and mouse models suggest tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) can cause inflammation and oxidative stress inside the vasculature, explained Mark Chandy, MD, PhD, a cardiologist scientist and assistant professor at Western University in London, Ontario, Canada. He is a co-author on the Stanford study as well as the &lt;em&gt;Nature Reviews Cardiology&lt;/em&gt; paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THC binds to the CB1 receptor, found in the brain, but also in the myocardium, vascular endothelial, and smooth muscle cells. The CB1 receptor promotes atherosclerotic changes, Chandy explained, adding mouse models have found that cannabis increases atherosclerotic plaques. Scientists also theorize that cannabis might have a prothrombotic effect increasing the risk for heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to arrhythmia, the activation of CB1 and CB2 receptors can also lead to enzyme inhibition that could ultimately affect the heart’s electrical conduction system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disturbing the Heart’s Electrical Conduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chip Lavie, MD, medical director at the John Ochsner Heart and Vascular Institute in New Orleans, Louisiana, said that “vasospasm and constriction of blood vessels combined with high platelet aggregation” is the most probable mechanism explaining the association between cannabis and cardiovascular disease. However, he also said that studies show that cannabis can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38946676/"&gt;increase the heart rate&lt;/a&gt;. “ Many studies show the benefits of a low resting heart rate,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lavie said that considering the evidence, he recommends patients avoid cannabis. If that is not possible, he advises patients to reduce their cannabis use and consume edible cannabis or oils, rather than smoking. Although there isn’t enough evidence to show that consuming cannabis by edibles or oils is safer for the heart, burning cannabis adds toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chandy suggested cardiologists inform patients who use cannabis about the potential long-term cardiovascular side effects. “I would advise them not to use cannabis. At least, they should be able to make an informed decision about it and know the potential consequences of it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the emerging association between cardiovascular disease and cannabis use, “there isn’t super strong evidence of causal effects,” said Anders Holt, MD, a cardiologist at Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark, who led the study that found higher rates of arrythmia among medical cannabis users. Mouse models frequently don’t translate to human physiology, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weighing the Evidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long-term randomized controlled trials studying cannabis and the heart are not feasible or ethical, evidence comes from observational studies, which are prone to confounders. For example, those who consume cannabis recreationally may be more likely to engage in other activities, like alcohol consumption or high-caloric diets, which can have an impact on cardiovascular results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the evidence linking cannabis use with &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/349040-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;coronary artery disease&lt;/a&gt; is based on studies of participants being asked about recent cannabis use. Patients may misremember previous use, focus only on their use in the last week, or hide their cannabis use from doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holt’s study was less prone to recall bias, as it relied on medical prescriptions, rather than self-reported data. Still, there could be important differences between patients who fill medical cannabis prescriptions and those who don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big picture, however, it may not matter whether the association between cannabis and an increased cardiovascular disease risk “is due to the lifestyle, or the selection of these patients, or the active components,” suggested Holt. “We know that people who use cannabis are at an elevated risk, so maybe they should be getting a more vigilant approach.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talking to Patients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holt said it would be reasonable “to bring up emerging evidence that puts into question whether medical cannabis is entirely safe for the heart” when talking to patients about lifestyle changes, they can make to reduce their risk for cardiovascular complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the increased risk for arrhythmia, Holt said his study doesn’t imply that medical cannabis shouldn’t be used for chronic pain, however. For one, the overall absolute risk for arrhythmia remains low. For another, treating pain allows patients to engage in activities that are good for their overall health, and cannabis could be safer than alternatives. “There is very good evidence that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1187334-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;antiepileptic drugs&lt;/a&gt;, and opioids are not ideal for the heart either.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to discussing why patients use cannabis, Chandy suggested cardiologists discuss with their patients how much cannabis they consume and the route of administration. “One of the good things about legalization is that we now have labels to indicate approximately how much THC is inside,” said Chandy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chandy is especially concerned about synthetic cannabinoids, created in labs to bind more tightly to the CB1 receptor and create more intense psychedelic effects. “The data is more limited on the synthetic cannabis but given that it’s binding so tightly to the CB1 receptor, I would expect that it would cause more cardiovascular disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also worries that the effects of cannabis will become more pronounced in the coming decades as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cannabis/health-effects/cannabis-and-teens.html"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; more young people are using cannabis. “Just like with cigarettes, it’s not just how much, but how long you’re exposed to it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medscape</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 12:05:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxNTjRoU2swRnNIWWdBTUZtRU1kcWFTa1RRRUl0ZjJxWHVLd2RrMllJc3hacDdsNmNrV0dOcGg5UGgzV25zXzcycWNkTy14RVgzSUJqLUdCdjVUTGJmQ2tkS1VkOHVhV2k4OS1aQ2twUnUtYWN4VGdQZkZka0h3SjFQNnpn</guid></item><item><title>Measles remains a danger to health even years after an infection - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxQX3RCQ3cxWTFlMzBVS1M1WVY3Q0EzSlNZc3R5TUVTNlAwUzRaUUJJR1E4VFdHaXFvRmJxR2NYZlV4YjNCV3NGTHJyZUF5bzd1LTdIakVvMlp1ZFZfR0RORVVSaDZ5YWlaQTNNZ2UwZWhNbThBMFhVQml2MGE3TDV2UXB4T051MFU4dlBRQ21uXzV3Umd3SnRyUDhPRm1wdzlpQ3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                Most kids recover from measles. But the virus can be deadly and can erase the immune system's memory.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico is now close to 300 reported cases, surpassing the total number of cases in all of the U.S. in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The outbreak&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/07/nx-s1-5312107/how-a-measles-outbreak-overwhelmed-a-small-west-texas-town" target="_blank"&gt; is happening in remote, rural areas&lt;/a&gt;. There have been a few isolated &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;cases reported in 13 other states &lt;/a&gt; — not related to the Texas outbreak. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the nationwide risk remains low and that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312088/measles-texas-outbreak-contagious-spread" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination is the key to prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, doctors say it's a good time to remember how dangerous and long-lasting the health consequences of measles can be.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;a href="https://www2.phs.org/providers/alexandria-cvijanovich/2070089" target="_blank"&gt;Alex Cvijanovich&lt;/a&gt; has been a practicing pediatrician for more than 20 years. She says she's still haunted by the memory of a teenage boy she treated at the start of her career in Utah.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The boy had contracted measles as a 7-month-old, when he was too young to be vaccinated. "He got the virus from a child in his neighborhood who was unvaccinated," says Cvijanovich, who now practices in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was a relatively mild case of measles, and the infant recovered. She says he grew up to be a healthy, bright kid — an honor student.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then in middle school, he started to develop troubling symptoms. "He started getting lost between classes, lost like he couldn't find what class to go to next," Cvijanovich says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Worried, the teen's parents took him to a series of doctors to figure out what was wrong, until a pediatric neurologist finally suspected a condition called &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560673/" target="_blank"&gt;subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, or SSPE&lt;/a&gt;. It's a degenerative neurological condition that typically develops seven to 10 years after a measles infection. It is almost always fatal. Cvijanovich was part of the hospital team that confirmed the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The problem is that there is no treatment for it," she says. "And he basically became more and more incapacitated over time."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some 18 months after his initial diagnosis, she says, the teenager died.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;SSPE was once considered quite rare. But Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease specialist in New York City who wrote&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5292478/measles-vaccination-kids-health-disease" target="_blank"&gt; a history of measles,&lt;/a&gt; says data from outbreaks in the U.S. over the past several decades suggests that may not always be the case.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It turns out that in some age groups, especially in kids under about age 2, it's much more common than we thought," Ratner says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, a review of &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/2/226/3106340" target="_blank"&gt;measles cases in California&lt;/a&gt; found that, between 1988 and 1991, SSPE cases occurred as frequently as 1 in every 1,367 cases in unvaccinated children under age 5.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Another study that looked at U.S. outbreaks between 1989 and 1991 put the rate of SSPE at roughly &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16235165/" target="_blank"&gt;1 out of every 4,600 &lt;/a&gt;measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccination prevents not just SSPE, but also other serious complications that measles can cause — including pneumonia and severe brain swelling.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And there's a common consequence from measles infection you might not know of: It can erase your immune memory.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Not only does your brain have a memory, but your immune system has a memory of all the pathogens it's encountered in the past," says &lt;a href="https://genetics.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/stephen-j-elledge" target="_blank"&gt;Stephen Elledge&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the genetics department at Harvard Medical School who studies how the immune system responds to pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Elledge says your immune system holds on to those memories, so the next time it encounters a virus, it knows how to fight it. But measles can destroy the cells that retain those memories.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"And when you lose that memory, then you're no longer immune to that particular pathogen," he says. "So the next time you get it, you've got to fight that battle all over again."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This effect is called immune amnesia. Elledge says it happens to some extent with every measles infection, though its severity varies widely. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So whenever you get measles, you lose some of your immune memory. And the more severe your case of measles is, the longer it lasts, the more of your immune system is destroyed."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/10/31/775081827/measles-virus-may-wipe-out-immune-protection-for-other-diseases" target="_blank"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, Elledge and his colleagues found that unvaccinated children had lost between 11% and 73% of their antibodies, which recognize and neutralize viruses and bacteria.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Other research suggests it can take &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaa3662" target="_blank"&gt;two to three years&lt;/a&gt; for the immune system to recover. And in the meantime, kids might be left vulnerable to infection from other diseases, including ones they had previously been immune to.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Researchers say immune amnesia helps explain one phenomenon that was documented after the introduction of the measles vaccine in the 1960s: Deaths from other childhood diseases &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/05/07/404963436/scientists-crack-a-50-year-old-mystery-about-the-measles-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;dropped dramatically&lt;/a&gt;. Even deaths from diseases like pneumonia and diarrhea were cut in half.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ratner says as routine childhood vaccination rates fall, the U.S. is likely to see more and larger measles outbreaks. "There's no doubt that we will in the future see the long-term consequences of measles," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But he says we have a safe and powerful tool to prevent those consequences — vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Mosquitoes are infected when they feed from an infected waterbird. They then pass the virus to other waterbirds. Sometimes other animals, and people, can be infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pigs are also a host, and the virus has spread through commercial piggeries in Victoria, NSW and Queensland. (But it poses no food safety risk.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feral pigs and other animals can also play a role in transmission cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 eeRWaN"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/10/7/40/Ex-Tropical-Cyclone-Alfred-Brings-Severe-Weather-To-Australias-East-Coast-9wfabpsn.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/10/7/40/Ex-Tropical-Cyclone-Alfred-Brings-Severe-Weather-To-Australias-East-Coast-9wfabpsn.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/10/7/40/Ex-Tropical-Cyclone-Alfred-Brings-Severe-Weather-To-Australias-East-Coast-9wfabpsn.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Japanese encephalitis is one of the most serious diseases that spreads via mosquitoes" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-29572"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Japanese encephalitis is one of the most serious diseases that spreads via mosquitoes&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people infected show no symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with mild cases may have a fever, headache and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In more serious cases – about one in 250 people infected – people may have neck stiffness, disorientation, drowsiness and seizures. Serious illness can have life-long neurological complications and, in some cases, the infection can be life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific treatment for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When did Japanese encephalitis get to Australia and why is it in Brisbane?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks of Japanese encephalitis had occurred in the Torres Strait during the 1990s. The virus was also detected in the Cape York Peninsula in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had been no evidence of activity on the mainland since 2004 but everything changed in the summer of 2021–22. Japanese encephalitis virus was detected in commercial piggeries in southeastern Australia during that summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This prompted the declaration of a Communicable Disease Incident of National Significance. At the time, flooding accompanying the La Niña-dominated weather patterns and a resulting boom in mosquito numbers, and waterbird populations, was thought responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus has spread in subsequent years and has been detected in the mosquito and arbovirus surveillance programs as well as detection in feral pigs and commercial piggeries in most states and territories. Only Tasmania has remained free of Japanese encephalitis virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human cases of infection have also been reported. There were more than 50 cases of disease and seven deaths in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases of Japanese encephalitis have already been reported from Queensland in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to concern about Japanese encephalitis virus and other mosquito-borne pathogens, health authorities around Australia have expanded and enhanced their surveillance programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Queensland, this includes mosquito monitoring at a number of locations, including urban areas of southeast Queensland. Mosquitoes collected in this monitoring program tested positive for Japanese encephalitis virus, promoting the current health warnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is its detection in Brisbane important?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to now, scientists have thought the risk of Japanese encephalitis was likely greatest following seasons of above-average rainfall or flooding. This provides ideal conditions for waterbirds and mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the activity of Japanese encephalitis virus over the summer of 2024–25 has taken many scientists by surprise. Before Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred arrived, there had been somewhat dry conditions with less waterbird activity and low mosquito numbers in many regions of eastern Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However there has still been widespread Japanese encephalitis virus activity in Victoria, NSW and Queensland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, Japanese encephalitis virus activity hasn’t extended to the coastal regions of southeast Queensland. The detection of the virus in suburban Brisbane may require authorities to rethink exactly where the virus may turn up next. Authorities are ramping up their surveillance to see just how widespread the virus is in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health authorities and scientists are also trying to understand how the virus moved from western areas of the state to the coast and what drives virus transmission in different regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no evidence the virus is active in coastal regions of northern NSW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding mosquito bites is the best way to reduce the risk of Japanese encephalitis virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cover up with long-sleeved shirts and long pants for a physical barrier against mosquito bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use topical insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus. Be sure to apply an even coat on all exposed areas of skin for the longest-lasting protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure any insect screens on houses, tents and caravans are in good repair and reduce the amount of standing water in the backyard. The more water there is around your home, the more opportunities for mosquitoes there are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A safe and effective vaccine is available against Japanese encephalitis. Each state and territory health authority (for example Queensland, NSW, Victoria) have specific recommendations about access to vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may take many weeks following vaccination to achieve sufficient protection, so prioritise reducing your exposure to bites in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cameron Webb is Clinical Associate Professor and Principal Hospital Scientist, University of Sydney&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andrew van den Hurk is a Medical Entomologist, The University of Queensland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/the-university-of-queensland-805"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/japanese-encephalitis-has-claimed-a-second-life-in-nsw-and-been-detected-in-brisbane-what-is-it-252373#:~:text=What%20is%20Japanese%20encephalitis%20virus,cycle%20between%20mosquitoes%20and%20waterbirds."&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the original article &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 10:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQandxWUFNdVZBN2xrTFZEdGhhYUtxYW1UdndIb2NQdnY5Q0dCNEM0WUxKX1JteUVNejQyTWlnZ2Uwa0MzQ3hZR21yREEta1BONTBBMl8tczU3enBPekkyV2xQM2F6V3hpRnNIaFRFbnV4Q3RTQ3VrR1llcmttakx3a0JWS1doZGNuLVUwZ2RpbHQ4V0NLanpvSnlPcGdWaFRoNWNFUmhVYw</guid></item><item><title>Families are asking doctors if kids can get the measles vaccine ahead of schedule.

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; children get the first dose of the MMR vaccine, which includes protection against measles, mumps, and rubella, when they are between 12 and 15 months old. The second dose is given when children are between the ages 4 and 6. Recently, parents have been asking if their kids can get the first shot before they turn 1 or the second shot before they’re 4, pediatricians said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Our nurses are being inundated with calls from families,” said Pring, who is also a pediatrician at a clinic in Boston and at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Somerville resident and mom Emily Hwang got her 2-year-old daughter her first measles vaccine when she was 1, on the recommended schedule. But the recent outbreak of measles led Hwang to get her daughter the second dose two years early.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I contacted my pediatrician and asked, with the measles epidemic happening now, should I be doing something?” Hwang said. She added, “The doctor said it was safe for her to get a second one, and she recommended it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Despite the surge in cases, experts said they still advise parents to vaccinate children on the CDC schedule unless they are traveling to areas with outbreaks. If parents do decide to give their kids the first vaccine dose before they turn 1, it would offer temporary protection but wouldn’t count toward the two-vaccine series.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;That’s because before the age of one, a child’s immune system is still developing, and a shot given that early isn’t considered sufficient to provide long-term protection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“A truly early dose is between 6 and 11 months, but we’re not recommending that unless someone is going to an area with an outbreak,” said Dr. Vandana Madhavan, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and primary care pediatrician at Mass General Hospital for Children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. Shirley Huang, chief of general pediatrics at Tufts Medical Center, said questions about early vaccination are increasingly coming from families who aren’t traveling but are still concerned about exposure at day care or from people coming to visit from other states.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

She blinks slowly, her head heavy. Was it too much wine again last night? Or was it the lorazepam? From the adjacent bathroom, her husband showers, oblivious to the small internal struggle playing out in her mind. The children?

Her character drifts through scenes in a daze, caught between sleep and wakefulness, her oversized sunglasses and bright smile masking the growing dependency beneath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="crtpc-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="crtpc-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="crtpc-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Though fictional, Ratliff’s story mirrors a harsh reality. In recent years, addiction to anti-anxiety medications such as Valium, Klonopin, and lorazepam (sold in Israel as Lorivan) has become a global concern, transcending age, class, and geography. What often starts as a "harmless pill for relaxation" can quickly spiral into dependence, making withdrawal a daunting challenge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="49epn-0-0"&gt;&lt;div data-offset-key="49epn-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="49epn-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The rise in prescription drug dependency highlights an alarming trend: an increasing reliance on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a id="ryiUtbViS2Jx" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/bj2hz4liye" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="49epn-1-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;medications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="49epn-2-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt; to manage daily stressors. What begins as a short-term solution can become a chemical prison with devastating effects on mental and physical health. Why is quitting so difficult? How do people get hooked in the first place? And what can be done before the pills take over?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="3qb5-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3qb5-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3qb5-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Dr. Chen Avni, a psychiatrist and deputy director of the psychiatric day treatment department at Ramat Hen Mental Health Center in Tel Aviv, explains that these medications belong to a class of drugs called benzodiazepines. "They enhance the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that slows down brain activity. In low doses, they induce relaxation, but in higher doses, they can cause drowsiness, memory impairment, confusion, and loss of balance."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="b9tfc-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="b9tfc-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="b9tfc-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;While the effects are similar to alcohol, benzodiazepines lack the intoxicating high. However, prolonged use can lead to cognitive impairment, decreased alertness, and, in elderly patients, an increased risk of dangerous falls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="cgtgf-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cgtgf-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cgtgf-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;According to Avni, addiction often develops when usage extends beyond the prescribed timeframe. "Initially, these medications are intended for short-term relief—typically no more than six weeks," he says. "The problem arises when patients feel they can’t function without them. That’s when we see cases of dependency, sometimes at alarmingly high doses."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="b89et-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="b89et-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="b89et-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Shahar Cohen, a clinical social worker specializing in addiction treatment, has seen this trend intensify. "Anxiety levels across the population have been rising, especially in the past year and a half," she says. "This isn’t just an individual issue—it affects families, workplaces, and entire communities."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="lv4o-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="2ptkd-0-0"&gt;&lt;div data-offset-key="2ptkd-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;a id="Syh8YW4sBh1e" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/bj2hz4liye" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2ptkd-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Prescription drug addiction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2ptkd-1-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt; cuts across all demographics. Some users first receive medication for legitimate issues like insomnia or acute anxiety. Others turn to them following major life stressors such as job loss, divorce, or a child's military enlistment. In many cases, what starts as a doctor-prescribed solution escalates into self-medication, leading to dependency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="28nie-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="28nie-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="28nie-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;For many, obtaining benzodiazepines legally isn’t enough. "One former patient of mine was using 16 times the recommended dose," Avni recalls. "He bought part of his supply through his healthcare provider and the rest on the black market."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="2nj8l-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="2nj8l-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2nj8l-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;This underground trade of prescription medication underscores a major challenge: when patients become addicted, they will go to great lengths to maintain their supply. "People often don’t realize they’re dependent until it’s too late," Cohen warns. "When the thought of being without the drug becomes unbearable, that’s a red flag."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="1oku7-0-0"&gt;&lt;div data-offset-key="1oku7-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="1oku7-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Experts emphasize that addiction must be treated holistically, addressing not just the physical dependency but also the underlying &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a id="SyT8Y114sr3Jx" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/r1ljgw11c0" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="1oku7-1-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;emotional triggers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="1oku7-2-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;. "Addiction is never just about the drug," Cohen explains. "It’s often about pain—whether emotional or psychological. The drug becomes a coping mechanism."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="bvjnc-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bvjnc-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bvjnc-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;For those struggling with benzodiazepine dependency, gradual withdrawal under medical supervision is crucial. "Abrupt discontinuation can be dangerous, leading to severe withdrawal symptoms like seizures and psychosis," Avni cautions. "I’m currently treating a patient who experienced vivid hallucinations after trying to quit cold turkey. We had to introduce a slow, controlled tapering process."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="7nes1-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="6q4cs-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6q4cs-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6q4cs-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Beyond physical detoxification, long-term recovery requires psychological support. "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective tool, especially for sleep disorders," Avni says. "For chronic anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder, alternative psychiatric treatments that are non-addictive should be considered."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="3ej3q-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3ej3q-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3ej3q-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Awareness around prescription drug dependency is growing, but change is slow. "There are still doctors who hesitate to confront addicted patients and continue writing prescriptions out of convenience or pressure," Avni notes. "But every physician prescribing these drugs should recognize the long-term risks. This isn't just a temporary fix—it can become a lifelong struggle."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="5tu06-0-0"&gt;&lt;div data-offset-key="5tu06-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5tu06-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The Israeli Health Ministry is currently working on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a id="H1xDYW4or2yg" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/bjth2nhxh" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5tu06-1-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;reforms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5tu06-2-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt; to address prescription drug addiction, including establishing specialized treatment clinics within health maintenance organizations (HMOs). These initiatives aim to provide better oversight, education, and intervention before patients spiral into dependency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dfj55" data-offset-key="ae0v1-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="ae0v1-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="ae0v1-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Ultimately, the best way to combat prescription drug addiction is prevention. "It’s crucial to start with the lowest effective dose and treat the root cause of the anxiety, insomnia, or distress," Avni advises. "No one is immune to addiction.

"Science still can’t predict who will become addicted and who won’t, so awareness is critical," she says. "If you suspect dependence—whether in yourself or someone close to you—don’t ignore it.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Managing screen time is an issue that defines modern parenthood. Teenagers — who often don't want to be managed in any way — present an extra set of challenges.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many parents know that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/04/25/1171773181/social-media-teens-mental-health" target="_blank"&gt;too much screen time is harmful &lt;/a&gt;for teenagers and they don't want their kids encountering unhealthy or dangerous content. But figuring out exactly how to provide guardrails to prevent these behaviors is hard. &lt;a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/8-18-census-integrated-report-final-web_0.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Research from Common Sense Media &lt;/a&gt;shows teenage screen time spiked during the pandemic; tweens averaged more than five hours a day and teenagers more than eight.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Parents are yearning for guidance," says Lauren Salem, a mom of four kids who span tween and teen years.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I think there's a lot of big picture guidance but really there's a kind of disconnect between — I get what I'm supposed to do, I get what we're supposed to be aware of — but how do we actually incorporate it in our life and family," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While there is no panacea or easy set of rules for managing screens, researchers at the American Psychological Association (APA) say there are some useful strategies. The organization recently issued&lt;a href="https://healthyviewing.apa.org/" target="_blank"&gt; this guide for parents.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" We really want parents to feel like — rather than throw up their hands and feel like it's totally impossible to monitor everything — give them some tools," says Mitch Prinstein, chief science officer at the APA.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The advice for  teens is different than for younger children. Here are some things to consider.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;1. Understand the digital landscape and the teenage brain&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Every single family I work with struggles with screens," says Kent Toussaint, a therapist who founded the &lt;a href="https://teentherapycenter.com/about-us/staff/kent-toussaint/" target="_blank"&gt;Teen Therapy Center i&lt;/a&gt;n Los Angeles and was not involved in this report. " I think a lot of times parents think that kids can self-regulate this and most kids cannot."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers who worked on the new report stress that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/17/1176452284/teens-social-media-phone-habit" target="_blank"&gt;teenage brains are ill-equipped&lt;/a&gt; to navigate today's digital landscape.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"During the teen years, the brain's reward centers are especially sensitive, while the parts that regulate self-control are still developing," the report states. Teen brains are also extra sensitive to peer and social influence; this combination of factors makes it difficult for teens to disengage with platforms that are often designed to engage them and keep them engaged.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;  2. Promote healthy viewing habits &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/social-media-internet/healthy-teen-video-viewing" target="_blank"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that kids who are frequently exposed to content that includes depictions of things like aggressive behavior, bullying or hostile language can become less empathetic. Some content can promote things like self-harm or substance use.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers say it's important to help kids learn how to identify these negative behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Encourage conversations about how different types of content make them feel," the report guidelines suggest. Drawing attention to their feelings helps teens build their own critical thinking skills when it comes to evaluating content.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The report points out that not all screen time is bad. Exposure to prosocial behaviors can help kids cultivate kindness. Teens need to learn to see these patterns themselves, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;3. Help them become critical thinkers&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;No parent can sit next to their child every minute that they're watching screens, of course. But Prinstein advises parents to spend time with their child watching content — even if it's short — and have a conversation about it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Focus on the nature of the content rather than getting caught up in keeping track of every video service," advise the authors. "Ask curious, non-judgmental questions about what your teen enjoys watching."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another suggestion is to work together to develop strategies for evaluating content thoughtfully. Kids don't like to be manipulated and can be receptive when parents initiate conversations about advertising, Prinstein says. He suggests pointing out things like the way ads are targeted based on viewing habits. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Or help them to identify sponsored content, even when it's subtly integrated into videos. Discuss how influencers build their audiences and what goes into creating their content, he advises.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;4. Above all, stay engaged   &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Often parents become overwhelmed, says Prinstein, but doing nothing when it comes to teens and screens is the worst possible thing. " When a parent's watching something with kids and something comes on screen that's not okay — maybe there's swearing, maybe there's explicit sex, maybe there's discrimination against others — parents might clam up at that point." If there's no discussion, Prinstein says "kids are more likely to assume that that means parents are a hundred percent okay with what they just saw."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And while teens are known for pushing back on parents, therapist Kent Toussaint  stresses that the strength of the relationship between parent and child fundamentally influences a child's habits around any kind of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The more we've invested in connecting and the relationship with our child, the more they're going to cooperate," he says. "The more they're going to work with us on our expectations."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the goal is not to control your child, but to help them learn to exert some measure of self-control, even if it takes practice and is not perfect, Prinstein says. After all, this is a skill even adults struggle with.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; "Sometimes modeling  that all of us are getting sucked in to doing this more than we want," he says, "is helpful."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
