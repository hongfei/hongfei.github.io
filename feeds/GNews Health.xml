			&lt;p&gt;A large Swedish &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214343?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; reported a lower risk of dementia among middle-aged and older adults who consumed higher amounts of full-fat cheese and cream. The findings may sound like welcome news but they need careful interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study followed 27,670 participants for 25 years, during which 3,208 developed &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/dementia-283"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among people without a known genetic risk for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="186945" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, eating more than 50 grams of full-fat cheese per day was associated with a 13%–17% lower risk of Alzheimer's. No such reduction was seen among people who carried genetic risk factors for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-drug-stalls-alzheimers-development-in-breakthrough-trial"&gt;New Drug Stalls Alzheimer's Development in Breakthrough Trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming more than 20 grams of full-fat cream per day was linked to a 16%–24% lower risk of dementia overall. No associations were found for low-fat or high-fat milk, fermented or non-fermented milk, or low-fat cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are notable given longstanding public &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/milk-and-dairy-nutrition/"&gt;health advice&lt;/a&gt; to choose low-fat dairy to reduce cardiovascular risk. This matters because heart disease and dementia share many risk factors, including high blood pressure,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="186945" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When evidence from previous studies is combined, analyses suggest that cheese consumption may also be linked to a lower risk of heart disease, and that full-fat dairy does not necessarily increase cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several other studies have explored whether similar patterns apply to brain health, but the results are mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186949" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186949" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/TwoPeopleDrinkingTakeawayCoffeesorMilkshakes-642x361.jpg" alt="Two young adults enjoying takeaway drinks on a bench outdoors" class="size-medium wp-image-186949" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/TwoPeopleDrinkingTakeawayCoffeesorMilkshakes-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/TwoPeopleDrinkingTakeawayCoffeesorMilkshakes-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/TwoPeopleDrinkingTakeawayCoffeesorMilkshakes-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/TwoPeopleDrinkingTakeawayCoffeesorMilkshakes.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186949" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;No need to add extra cream… (FatCamera/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38043604/"&gt;overall&lt;/a&gt; suggests that studies conducted in Asian populations are more likely to report benefits of dairy consumption for cognitive health, while many European studies do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible explanation is that average dairy intake tends to be much lower in Asian countries, meaning modest consumption may have different effects than higher intakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, one Japanese study reported a reduced dementia risk among people who ate cheese, but overall consumption levels were very low and the research was sponsored by a cheese producer. In contrast, another &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37335358/"&gt;Japanese study&lt;/a&gt; funded by government grants found no protective effect of cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some long-term European studies have also reported benefits. In a Finnish &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-022-02834-x"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 2,497 middle-aged men followed for 22 years, cheese was the only food associated with a lower dementia risk, reduced by 28%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumption of milk and processed red meat was linked to poorer performance on cognitive tests, while fish consumption was associated with better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-022-00615-2"&gt;UK study&lt;/a&gt; following nearly 250,000 people found that eating fish two to four times a week, fruit daily and cheese once a week was associated with lower dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these studies have important limitations. What people eat is usually self-reported, and changes in memory can affect both eating habits and how accurately people remember what they have eaten. To deal with this, the Swedish researchers took two extra steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, they excluded anyone who already had dementia when the study began. Then they repeated the same calculations after removing people who went on to develop dementia within the first ten years of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This did not mean starting the study again or recruiting new participants. It simply meant re-checking the results using a smaller group of people who remained dementia-free for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason for doing this is that the early stages of dementia can subtly change behaviour long before diagnosis. People may eat differently, lose their appetite, or struggle to recall their usual diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By focusing on participants who stayed cognitively healthy for many years, the researchers reduced the chance that these early changes were influencing the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important question is whether substitution played a role. Some of the apparent benefits may reflect replacing red or processed meat with cheese or cream, rather than an effect of dairy itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting this idea, the Swedish study found no association between full-fat dairy and dementia risk among participants whose diets remained stable over five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, foods should not be considered in isolation. Dietary patterns matter more than individual ingredients. Diets such as the &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-022-00615-2"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, which is consistently associated with lower risks of both dementia and heart disease, include cheese alongside vegetables, fish, whole grains, and fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186951" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186951" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay-642x361.jpg" alt="Flatlay of various fresh healthy foods" class="size-medium wp-image-186951" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/HealthyFoodDisplay.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186951" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Eating a healthy, varied diet can help protect brain health. (AlexRaths/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Swedish study, people who consumed more full-fat cheese and cream were also more educated, less likely to be overweight, and had lower rates of conditions linked to dementia, including heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, and diabetes. All of these factors independently reduce dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that higher cheese intake tended to occur within healthier overall lifestyles, rather than alongside excess calorie consumption or poor metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-6-key-depression-symptoms-that-predict-dementia-risk"&gt;Scientists Identify 6 Key Depression Symptoms That Predict Dementia Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the evidence does not support the idea that full-fat dairy causes dementia, nor that fermented milk products reliably protect against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full-fat cheese contains several nutrients relevant to brain health, including fat-soluble  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="186945" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; A, D, and K2, as well as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="186945" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; B12, folate, iodine, zinc, and selenium. These nutrients play roles in neurological function and may help support cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the data do not justify eating large amounts of cheese or cream as protective foods against dementia or heart disease. The most consistent message remains that balanced diets, moderation, and overall lifestyle matter far more than any single item on the cheese board.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/272138/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/eef-hogervorst-1283596"&gt;Eef Hogervorst&lt;/a&gt;, Professor of Biological Psychology, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/loughborough-university-1336"&gt;Loughborough University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Snacking before bed is fine—if you pick sleep-friendly foods like nuts, yogurt, oats, or tart cherries that curb hunger and support restful sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nutrients like fiber, magnesium, tryptophan, and melatonin can boost sleep quality while keeping you satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skip sugar, alcohol, caffeine, and heavy or spicy foods at night, as they can disrupt sleep and digestion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s all too common to feel &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/stop-late-night-cravings-11836290" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nagging hunger pangs&lt;/a&gt; in the hours between dinner and bedtime. Unfortunately, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/heart-healthy-snacks-for-late-night-cravings-11777163" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;nighttime snacks and drinks&lt;/a&gt; often have a not-so-healthy reputation—it’s easy to reach for the most convenient (and crave-worthy) options after a day of making nutritious choices. While those late-night treats may be delicious, some can interfere with sleep quality and leave you feeling unsatisfied. That’s a frustrating double whammy, especially since good sleep is a cornerstone of overall health and wellness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news? Needing a snack before bed isn’t a problem—with the right choices, a nighttime snack can be both satisfying and nourishing. Here, experts share some delicious, healthy options that curb hunger and support restful sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-optimal-nutrients-for-healthy-nighttime-snacks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Optimal Nutrients for Healthy Nighttime Snacks &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Foods with these nutrients aren’t just healthy for you, but also support a good night’s rest—so they’re perfect healthy night snacks. When midnight hunger comes knocking, reach for:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-fiber-do-you-need-a-day-7564730" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fiber supports optimal health&lt;/a&gt; by regulating the blood sugar response, lowering cholesterol levels, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-to-help-you-poop-11769125" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;encouraging healthy digestion&lt;/a&gt;, increasing satiety after eating (ideal for evening snacks!), and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-foods-for-gut-health-11833113" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;supporting the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. A thriving gut microbiome supports the immune system, brain health, and several other body systems. And interestingly enough, a &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/fo/d2fo01178f" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; showed that fiber’s positive impact on the microbiome may be linked to better sleep by supporting the gut-brain axis and reducing symptoms of several sleep disorders. &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-fiber-foods-11690551" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;Fiber is found largely in plant-based foods&lt;/a&gt; including fruits, veggies, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Magnesium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the most common dietary supplements for those with sleep troubles is magnesium. “Magnesium, found in nuts, seeds, spinach, and tart cherry juice, may improve sleep quality so that you feel more rested and may help you fall asleep faster,” says Bianca Tamburello, RDN. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35184264/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;2023 review&lt;/a&gt; on this key mineral supports these benefits. Though further research is warranted, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/foods-high-in-magnesium" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;magnesium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; are undoubtedly healthy additions to your after-dinner snack, too, as they promote better bone, heart, and metabolic health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Vitamin D &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ever elusive &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-get-more-vitamin-d-11807401" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D is essential&lt;/a&gt; for optimal immune, heart, metabolic, and bone health, but emerging research is also finding it to be &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/vitamins-for-better-sleep-8660402" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;super beneficial for sleep&lt;/a&gt;. This is thanks to a handful of proposed mechanisms, including: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D’s role in serotonin and melatonin production that are essential to healthy circadian rhythms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D receptors on the brain stem that play an important role in sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D’s impact on certain pain disorders (like &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.994545/full" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;restless leg syndrome&lt;/a&gt;) that may negatively impact sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These impacts have been found in a multitude of studies, but are well summarized in this &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8912284/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;2022 systematic review&lt;/a&gt; published in Nutrients. Some great dietary sources of vitamin D include cod liver oil, salmon, swordfish, tuna, sardines, beef liver, egg yolk, fortified orange juice, fortified dairy and plant milks, and fortified cereals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Omega-3 Fatty Acids &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Research shows that omega-3 supplementation &lt;a href="https://www.nutraingredients.com/Article/2021/01/28/Study-says-omega-3-supplements-improve-sleep-in-people-with-low-fish-consumption" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;may improve sleep&lt;/a&gt; for those eating few omega-3 rich foods,” Tamburello says. This could be thanks to the fatty acid’s role in melatonin regulation. “Eating more &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-fats-8740244" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;foods high in omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt; like salmon, walnuts, and chia seeds, may improve sleep by promoting higher melatonin levels,” she adds. Plus, omega-3s promote heart, brain, and immune health, among many other impressive benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Antioxidants &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Antioxidant-rich micronutrients like plant compounds, vitamin E, and vitamin C are also food additions to a bedtime snack. They help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/anti-inflammatory-foods-11684448" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, promoting overall health and immunity, while also aiding in pain alleviation that may interfere with quality shut-eye. Foods especially high in antioxidants include berries, citrus fruit, leafy greens, beets, nuts, seeds, and whole grains—though most plant-based foods contain at least some.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Tryptophan &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We’ve all heard the common trope that the &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/tryptophan-foods-6823810" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tryptophan found in turkey&lt;/a&gt; is to blame for the Thanksgiving nap many of us take after the big meal. And as it turns out, some of this may be true. “Tryptophan, which is often associated with turkey, but also found in dairy, chicken, and fish, can help &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/mind-mood/mood-boosting-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;boost serotonin&lt;/a&gt; levels to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33942088/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;positively impact sleep&lt;/a&gt;,” Tamburello explains.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Melatonin is a hormone produced naturally by the body to promote sleep, but can also be found as a supplement and in foods including tart cherry juice, walnuts, almonds, oats, and grapes,” Tamburello says. And there’s plenty of evidence to back this up, with research pointing to its role in improving symptoms of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36064286/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sleep disorders&lt;/a&gt;, while also helping you to fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.

These nutritional perks will encourage overall health, satiety, and sleep. Plus, if you opt for lightly salted nuts, it can help to curb your salty cravings after dinner.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The satisfying sweetness of a smoothie bowl is perfect after dinner.

This is due to its omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D. Salmon from Chile is especially beneficial in this regard as it is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25108414/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;particularly high&lt;/a&gt; in omega-3s.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overnight oats can save the day at night—not just at breakfast time. They contain omega-3 fatty acids, melatonin, magnesium, fiber, and antioxidants found in ingredients like oats and chia seeds. Top with berries and a splash of milk to help with those sugar cravings.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The tryptophan found in turkey (and chicken!) will help you have a more complete night’s sleep, making turkey roll-ups the perfect slightly salty nighttime snack. Roll up nitrate-free, low-sodium deli turkey with lettuce, tomato, your condiments of choice, and maybe a slice of cheese.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The tryptophan and vitamin D found in yogurt, especially, will also promote healthy sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Crunchy foods are a common craving in the hours after dinner. High-fiber popcorn and protein-filled edamame are excellent choices, but don’t sleep on fresh-cut veggies and a satisfying dip. Dip them in vitamin D and tryptophan-rich cottage cheese to promote sleep and add an irresistibly savory bite. I top my cottage cheese with everything bagel seasoning for extra flavor. If you’re really not a cottage cheese fan, hummus, yogurt dip, or guacamole are delicious, savory, filling options too!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you need something truly zero-fuss—just a light, airy, crunchy bite—reach for a few handfuls of plain or lightly salted popcorn. This snack is technically a whole grain that'll provide a bit more fiber than other late-night, bagged snacks like potato chips or pretzels. Try a pre-bagged option from the grocery store that's easy on the sodium levels, made with little to no oils, and doesn't have any or much added sugar.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Believe it or not, cheese one of the simplest—and most delicious—ways to induce sleep when you're snacking before bed. Cheese contains tryptophan&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, an amino acid that carries sleep-regulating properties. Additionally, the calcium found in cheese mixes with tryptophan to produce melatonin—the sleep-inducing hormone. Seriously, think about all those times you felt a bit lethargic after eating from a cheese board; you weren't just imagining it!

If you happen to be up late and your stomach's aching for a snack, consider whipping up an egg or two to satiate you (and lull you to sleep).

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the other side of the coin, there are certain &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-you-should-never-eat-before-bed-11684466" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;foods you should avoid before bed&lt;/a&gt; because they can disrupt nightly sleep or leave us still-hungry and lacking satisfying nutrients.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol, high-sugar products, ultra-processed foods: &lt;/strong&gt;These include alcohol, ultra-processed foods, and added sugars. As pro-inflammatory agents, these foods can hurt sleep quality, potentially causing stomach upset, interfering with normal sleep patterns (as is the case with &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleepadvances/article/3/1/zpac023/6632721" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://mana.md/sugar-and-sleep/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;added sugar&lt;/a&gt;), or promoting spikes in energy, which added sugar tends to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/should-you-drink-coffee-before-bed-7255700" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Caffeine-rich drinks&lt;/a&gt; and foods—certain teas, coffee, energy drinks, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-caffeine-in-chocolate-8383422" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;chocolate&lt;/a&gt;—should also be approached with caution post-dinner, as caffeine is a stimulant that promotes stamina and wakefulness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spicy foods and high-saturated fat foods: &lt;/strong&gt;“Additionally, spicy foods and hard-to-digest high-fat foods can cause acid reflux if eaten too close to bedtime, interfering with healthy sleep patterns” Tamburello adds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you feel that you’re ravenous soon after dinner, it’s possible that you’re restricting too much,” Tamburello says. “For maximum nutrition and filling power, aim to make half your plate a fiber-rich veggie, a quarter of your plate a lean protein, and a quarter of your plate a whole grain or complex carbohydrate.” This winning combination of nutrients should &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/most-satiating-foods-8424198" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;leave you feeling satisfied&lt;/a&gt; well after you’ve finished your meal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/why-am-i-craving-sugar" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sugar cravings&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/why-do-i-crave-salt" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;salt cravings&lt;/a&gt; hit you at night, it’s important to look at the whole picture of your daily life—these cravings can be brought on by stress, habitually consuming higher amounts of these foods regularly, dehydration, and (ironically) poor sleep habits. The healthy snacks highlighted above should help to curb some of these cravings, while &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.realsimple.com/mindfulness-activities-7555756" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;practicing mindfulness&lt;/a&gt; can be beneficial, too. The practice of mindfulness helps us tune into our bodies to determine whether we’re actually hungry, experiencing an empty craving, snacking out of a behavioral habit, or actually have another need, like drinking more water.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-whats-the-best-time-for-a-nightly-snack"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What’s the Best Time for a Nightly Snack? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In terms of when the best time for a nighttime snack is, “some research suggests that eating &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9092657/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;four to six hours&lt;/a&gt; before bed is best to prevent digestion from interfering with sleep, while &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/nutrition/is-it-bad-to-eat-before-bed" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;other experts recommend&lt;/a&gt; eating up to 2 hours before bed,” Tamburello says. In other words, there are several schools of thought, and it really depends on you, your appetite, and other contextual factors. “The bottom line: If you’re hungry, you should eat something,” she says.

			&lt;p&gt;There's an unwritten rule in publishing, or so I've been told: Don't write about COVID. Our collective attention span has been saturated by those endless months holed up in attics and cramped corners of apartments, staring out at a world we could no longer take part in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the worst of it passed, we felt an urge to close that chapter, to padlock it behind a heavy latch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in doing so, we also tuck away the hard-won lessons of that time: how quickly systems buckle, how two decades of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/coronavirus-5830"&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; warnings &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2022.07.009"&gt;accumulated without adequate preparedness&lt;/a&gt;, and how the very mechanisms we rely on for safety can become the scaffolding of a next disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/worlds-first-death-from-h5n5-bird-flu-strain-reported-in-us"&gt;World's First Death From H5N5 Bird Flu Strain Reported in US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matters now as another threat is taking shape: highly pathogenic avian  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="186706" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt;, known as bird  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="186706" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bird flu still poses a low‑probability threat of sustained human transmission. But that doesn't make the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="186706" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The H5  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="186706" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.dw.com/en/virus-has-killed-almost-9-million-birds-and-counting/a-74972319"&gt;brutally lethal&lt;/a&gt; to birds – 9 million have died outright, and hundreds of millions have been culled to contain the spread. &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/h5n1-bird-flu-cases-spike-in-europe-how-worried-should-we-be-269962"&gt;Alarming&lt;/a&gt; is the virus's expanding reach into mammals. So far, at least 74 mammal species, from elephant seals to polar bears, have suffered die‑offs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The individual cases are situated within a broader shift. Dense poultry farms create opportunities for the virus to hop species. Over a &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-virus-type-h5n1-us-dairy-cattle"&gt;thousand US dairy herds&lt;/a&gt; have tested positive in the past two years, and viral fragments have even been detected in milk – &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/06/nx-s1-5600125/bird-flu-risk-outbreak-trump-administration"&gt;a worrying route&lt;/a&gt; of spillover. Every jump is a probe for new footholds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Europe is &lt;a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/news/avian-influenza-europe-enhanced-surveillance-and-strict-biosecurity-needed-detections-surge?"&gt;seeing a surge too&lt;/a&gt;. From early September to mid-November 2025, 1,444 infected wild birds were found across 26 countries: a quadrupling compared with the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human cases remain rare: only &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/influenza/h5n1-human-case-cumulative-table/cumulative-number-of-confirmed-human-cases-for-avian-influenza-a(h5n1)-reported-to-who--2003-2025ac90dee8-f1c4-4ff6-b891-f92e0df414cb.pdf?sfvrsn=447db8c4_3&amp;amp;download=true"&gt;992&lt;/a&gt; confirmed H5N1 infections worldwide since 2003, though with a near‑50% fatality rate. But the numbers are increasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Americas have logged 75 cases since 2022, and in November, the US recorded its &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj.r2480"&gt;first H5N5 death&lt;/a&gt; in a patient with existing health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186710" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186710" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/CowsOnADairyFarm-642x361.jpg" alt="Multiple cows on a dairy farm" class="wp-image-186710 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/CowsOnADairyFarm-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/CowsOnADairyFarm-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/CowsOnADairyFarm-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/CowsOnADairyFarm.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186710" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;More than 1,000 US dairy herds have tested positive in the past two years. (TinaFields/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And although no human cases have been reported in Europe, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Zoonotic_influenza_pre_pandemic_scenarios_SARMS%20FINAL%20VERSION2.pdf"&gt;warns&lt;/a&gt; that the widespread animal circulation raises the risk of spillover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My research focuses on how warnings collapse before catastrophe, from geopolitical shocks to intelligence failures and industrial accidents. The pattern is often the same. Frontline observers spot something early, but the signal fades as it moves upward, diluted by bureaucracy, competing interpretations, or institutional forgetfulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent Hong Kong fire is yet another tragic example: residents at Wang Fuk Court &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-hong-kong-fire/"&gt;had raised multiple alarms&lt;/a&gt; about the styrofoam boards that ignited with a lighter, the uncertified netting and the pattern of ignored safety notices long before the blaze, yet those concerns never gained traction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The failures I study share recurring blind spots: weak signals drowned out by noise, bureaucratic habits that slow or soften uncomfortable messages, and the political instinct to downplay problems that threaten established narratives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you see warning as a chain running from detection to decision, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/isr/article/27/1/viaf009/8109154"&gt;collapse is often partial&lt;/a&gt;. Some links hold. Others jam at the moment they are most needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bird flu now sits inside that kind of chain. The technical ability to detect change is there: veterinarians, virologists and surveillance systems are picking up signals, sequencing viruses and logging outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the infrastructure meant to catch the virus in its early stages is &lt;a href="http://npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/06/nx-s1-5600125/bird-flu-risk-outbreak-trump-administration"&gt;fraying&lt;/a&gt;. The agencies that once charted the terrain of emerging  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="186706" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt; threats have been hollowed out – budgets trimmed, staff evaporated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Surveillance falters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study of 31 European nations warned that COVID exposed a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/34/2/402/7603330"&gt;"critical gap in preparedness"&lt;/a&gt; and urged standardised indicators and open data as the foundation for any future response. The EU's freshly launched &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/scenarios-pre-pandemic-zoonotic-influenza-preparedness-and-response"&gt;pre-pandemic plan&lt;/a&gt; is a good step, but it cannot mask the gaps in day-to-day monitoring and response that still leave countries exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the Atlantic, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/01/nx-s1-5619764/months-of-tumult-and-waves-of-staff-cuts-take-a-toll-on-the-cdc"&gt;cuts&lt;/a&gt; have left the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scrambling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American scientists warn that federal reporting has slowed: the United States Department of Agriculture &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/23/health/h5n1-usda-gisaid-genetic-sequences"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; too little genetic data on the outbreak in cattle and other affected animals, released it late, and in formats researchers could not use. It left scientists unable to track how the virus was evolving or spreading across herds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.midlandfarmer.co.uk/2025/12/04/uk-poorly-prepared-for-animal-disease-outbreaks/"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt;, domestic surveillance capacity has equally faced strain, with reduced access to European disease intelligence and chronic vet shortages weakening early detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the signal dims within institutions, it dims for the public as well. And a weak warning rarely travels far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2025.308080"&gt;poll&lt;/a&gt; shows this clearly: most Americans don't even register bird flu as a credible threat. What doesn't help is that symptoms in humans can be so mild that they slide past notice. A &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2024/05/bird-avian-flu-h5n1-cows-pandemic-threat.html"&gt;case&lt;/a&gt; in a dairy worker earlier this year looked like nothing more than conjunctivitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of this means a new pandemic is imminent. Health authorities still say the chance of an efficient human-to-human outbreak &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/bird-flu-poses-risk-pandemic-worse-than-covid-frances-institut-pasteur-says-2025-11-27/"&gt;is low&lt;/a&gt;. These viruses rarely make that leap. And we're not helpless. We're &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2024/05/bird-avian-flu-h5n1-cows-pandemic-threat.html"&gt;better prepared&lt;/a&gt; than we were before COVID: We have vaccine candidates, clearer protocols and agencies that learned painful lessons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spikes-of-bird-flu-in-cats-could-be-a-warning-of-a-future-pandemic"&gt;Spikes of Bird Flu in Cats Could Be a Warning of a Future Pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But low isn't none. And if it were to occur, the consequences could be catastrophic. Most people have some immunity to the seasonal flu strains. We probably have &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/bird-flu-poses-risk-pandemic-worse-than-covid-frances-institut-pasteur-says-2025-11-27/"&gt;none&lt;/a&gt; to H5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And influenza doesn't restrict itself to the frail in the way COVID often did; past flu epidemics killed healthy adults in large numbers. Adding to the concern, health expertise itself &lt;a href="https://www.apha.org/topics-and-issues/public-health-under-threat"&gt;has come under attack&lt;/a&gt;, weakening the very authority that should turn signals into action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we avert our eyes from the bird flu threat because our systems have grown inattentive, underfunded and unprepared, we risk repeating that same pattern. And the next alarm will arrive too late for anyone to claim they didn't see it coming.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271765/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

																										&lt;p&gt;Questions about the nature of &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/category/consciousness/"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt; remain among the most perplexing areas of modern &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/category/science/"&gt;scientific research&lt;/a&gt;, with implications for neuroscience and &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/lost-in-thought-how-meditation-can-sometimes-unsettle-the-mind/"&gt;the human mind&lt;/a&gt;, as well as our broader &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/darpas-inspire-program-seeks-to-revolutionize-our-understanding-of-how-the-brain-constructs-reality/"&gt;concept of reality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2025, many new thresholds in this complex area of study were crossed, with empirical inquiry into our questions about the nature of consciousness occurring within fields such as &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/category/neuroscience/"&gt;neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/category/psychology/"&gt;psychology&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/category/health/"&gt;medicine&lt;/a&gt;. Many advancements in this area over the last year have also challenged long-held assumptions about where and how consciousness originates, how widespread it may be, and how profoundly &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/study-finds-mindfulness-training-may-induce-altered-states-of-consciousness/"&gt;altered states&lt;/a&gt; can reshape human perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at just a few of the major stories involving consciousness, the mind, awareness, and the science behind it all that &lt;em&gt;The Debrief &lt;/em&gt;has covered in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did ‘Universal Consciousness’ Exist Before the Big Bang? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the year’s most provocative work about consciousness, one controversial peer-reviewed paper published in &lt;em&gt;AIP Advances &lt;/em&gt;proposed that “&lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/new-study-claims-universal-consciousness-existed-before-the-big-bang-and-still-shapes-our-reality/"&gt;universal consciousness&lt;/a&gt;” may have existed before the Big Bang, functioning not as a byproduct of matter but as a foundational feature of reality itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_27271" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-27271" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-27271 lazyload" data-src="https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/consciousness.jpg" alt="Consciousness" data-srcset="https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/consciousness.jpg 2324w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/consciousness-300x182.jpg 300w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/consciousness-1024x621.jpg 1024w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/consciousness-768x466.jpg 768w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/consciousness-1536x932.jpg 1536w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/consciousness-2048x1243.jpg 2048w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/consciousness-770x467.jpg 770w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/consciousness-1400x849.jpg 1400w" data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" src=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-27271" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(Image Credit: Pixabay)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such claims are nothing new and remain hotly debated by researchers, although they reflect a growing willingness among scientists to explore questions about consciousness, whether it is purely emergent or could play a deeper role in shaping the universe. The result has been a reignition of discussions long relegated to philosophy, now increasingly framed through modern cosmology and theoretical physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consciousness May Be Far More Widespread Than Previously Believed &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closer to Earth, neuroscientists and cognitive researchers have increasingly argued that consciousness may be far older and more widespread than traditionally believed. Studies examining simple organisms, brain networks, and evolutionary pathways this year, undertaken by researchers at Ruhr University Bochum, suggested that rudimentary forms of awareness &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/scientists-say-consciousness-is-far-older-and-more-widespread-than-we-ever-realized/"&gt;could predate complex nervous systems&lt;/a&gt; throughout the animal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than being the apex of the human evolutionary process, the researchers argue in a pair of papers that appeared in &lt;em&gt;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B,&lt;/em&gt; consciousness “rather represents a more basic cognitive process, possibly shared with other animal phyla.” This reframing has major implications not only for how scientists define consciousness but also for how humans understand their relationship to other life forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychedelic Therapy and Related Discoveries  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most tangible advances came from renewed interest in altered states of consciousness, particularly through psychedelic research. Multiple studies in 2025 demonstrated that psychedelic compounds &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/psychedelics-can-quickly-reorganize-our-brain-functions-offering-promise-for-lasting-therapeutic-approaches/"&gt;can rapidly reorganize brain networks&lt;/a&gt;, temporarily dissolving rigid patterns of thought associated with depression, trauma, and addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_39629" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39629" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-39629 lazyload" data-src="https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/magic-mushrooms.jpg" alt="psilocybin" data-srcset="https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/magic-mushrooms.jpg 800w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/magic-mushrooms-300x199.jpg 300w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/magic-mushrooms-768x509.jpg 768w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/magic-mushrooms-360x240.jpg 360w, https://thedebrief.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/magic-mushrooms-770x510.jpg 770w" data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" src=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-39629" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(Image Credit: Pixabay/CC0 Public Domain)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, scientists explored non-drug pathways to similar states, such as research into &lt;a href=""&gt;ancient breathwork techniques combined with modern neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; that suggests altered states resembling psychedelic experiences could be induced through controlled breathing alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, long-term studies also continued to examine the social and spiritual dimensions of psychedelic experiences. Decades of research now suggest that such states often produce a heightened sense of connection—to other people, to nature, and to perceived transcendent realities. In 2025, &lt;a href=""&gt;experiments involving participants from diverse religious backgrounds&lt;/a&gt; highlighted how profoundly personal belief systems shape the interpretation of these experiences, even when the underlying neurochemical mechanisms are shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pitting Consciousness Theories Against Each Other &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, researchers &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/i-think-therefore-i-am-study-pitting-top-theories-of-consciousness-against-each-other-reveals-its-findings/"&gt;made rare progress on a long-standing scientific impasse: competing theories of consciousness&lt;/a&gt;. Chris Plain, reporting for &lt;em&gt;The Debrief&lt;/em&gt; in May on a 2025 Allen Institute study, described Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and the Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT), a pair of differing approaches to consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting research revealed functional connections between neurons within the visual areas of the brain and the brain’s frontal areas, which the researchers behind the study say helps them “understand how our perceptions tie to our thoughts” while also reducing the typical emphasis on “the importance of the prefrontal cortex in consciousness, suggesting that while it’s important for reasoning and planning, consciousness itself may be linked with sensory processing and perception.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;University of Virginia Researchers Study Support Gaps for NDE Experiencers &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, 2025 saw increased attention to near-death experiences (NDEs) as a legitimate area of study. Researchers at the University of Virginia &lt;a href="https://thedebrief.org/university-of-virginia-researchers-identify-support-gaps-for-people-recovering-from-near-death-experiences/"&gt;identified significant gaps in psychological and medical support for people who report NDEs&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom struggle to integrate these experiences into their lives. While interpretations of NDEs vary widely, the research emphasized a growing consensus: regardless of cause, such experiences can be deeply transformative—and ignoring their impact may carry real mental health consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these stories reveal a year in which consciousness research moved decisively out of the shadows. Whether probing the origins of awareness in the early universe, mapping its neural signatures, or exploring its therapeutic potential, scientists in 2025 treated consciousness not as an unspeakable mystery—but as a frontier worth confronting directly.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="156" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjna93js001n3b78set17ghu@published"&gt;I have always been curious about group sex. I’ve dabbled in the world of Feeld lately, and have received some interest from hot men for potential threesomes/more and have been tempted to try it but something keeps holding me back. I’m so afraid of feeling like the odd one out or the less enticing person in the party. It’s an insecurity I would say I have in many areas of life beyond sex—I often feel like the one who gets left out in the friend group or the social gathering and I’m so afraid of feeling rejected in that way in a sexual context. Is there a way to protect against that? Am I completely off base to even worry that someone would inevitably get left out, and that someone would be me? I just don’t want to walk away from something that was supposed to be really hot, feeling like I didn’t get picked again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="153" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjna93us001q3b786d0sx1ub@published"&gt;The fear of being left out is so common it must be up there with fears of heights and snakes. This can be especially pronounced in vulnerable situations like sex, when rejection feels that much more personal as a result of what has been revealed (your body, your desires, etc.). However, when it comes to pursuing sex, rejection is always a possibility, and that’s how it has to be. People must have the ability to revoke consent at any moment for whatever reason, and the hurt feelings of those who are denied is merely collateral. It can suck, but you know what makes it suck less? Being rejected! You get used to it. You see that it’s not really a big deal, that it’s often not personal, and that you’ll live to see another dick. It can actually be character-building and I think it would be a good thing for you to experience.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjna93yi001r3b78cm748l37@published"&gt;If you can’t bear the thought of being rejected, I don’t think you should be on Feeld or any app for that matter—it’s just a matter of time before you find yourself enormously disappointed. Working through this fear of rejection via means other than exposure could also benefit you. For example, you may want to talk to a therapist about your strong feelings here.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="205" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjna942b001s3b78acegjfrt@published"&gt;However, I do think that your fear in the context you wrote about is somewhat overblown. You are afraid of being left out of group sex that you will have coordinated. While it is true that interacting on apps and in person are two very different modes of communication, you can assume that people are going to be showing up because you have attracted them via what you look like, what you’re offering, and your overall vibe. When people leave their house to have sex (or open their home to host it), they want to have a good time. No one is joining in this group with the objective of leaving you out—that would contradict the point of getting together in the first place. You can help safeguard against being left out, though, by enlisting only straight guys to participate. I don’t think it would be wrong of you to say that you want to be the focus and so all action should involve you. I know gay bottoms that take this approach to group sex/gangbangs and it works out for them. This is one situation where it’s really OK to express your selfishness. I think a lot of guys will just find that hot.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjna949i001u3b78ssh6imbi@published"&gt;I am a 48-year-old man, and for the last year I thought I was suffering from ED, but it turns out that I just can’t get it up for my wife anymore.  When it comes to porn, I’m back in business. What can I do to rekindle the flame with her?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjna94jl001x3b78p7z2suxf@published"&gt;Your assessment sounds right—usually when erectile dysfunction is situational (that is, you can get hard in some situations but not others), it’s regarded as being a psychologically rooted issue (as opposed to a physiological one as a result of, say, diabetes). That said, you are 48 and it’s likely that your testosterone levels aren’t what they used to be. If you aren’t regularly seeing a doctor/getting bloodwork, now’s the time.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="193" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjna94nm001y3b78c39txzum@published"&gt;Rekindling could look like a lot of things. If you are having wood issues with your wife, she must be noticing and so a conversation may be useful. It’s common in long-term relationships for desire to wane—Esther Perel’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mating-Captivity-Unlocking-Erotic-Intelligence-ebook/dp/B000UODXP0/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2KFLDW9XS3D4&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.9TBgqJH8OXaXJ6KF-p0h2kiUlcEoJVKlMs9LiYHOqbmj3Ltj7tID5mjXlzIy3vFrG-ffA-RkeZjl5zQROs7-3kM8mUhqQUWNxRLL3FauXHkiHYn8o8qVtOT_87IekJCsF76G9rzN0dgy_WDoRNyLXuy62WJsygbNVXDhP6yrk2mODHIW0D6GwNKpTZH-ZlPyxA09WKWnURyMj5NUW4QmHLe1hhXeCS78p77v1q5h6S0.CEYYxaVRazv_Twik-AToMJu7pLXiTSTRs2ZBbnKTNlI&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=mating+in+captivity+esther+perel&amp;amp;qid=1766454898&amp;amp;sprefix=mating+in+ca,aps,137&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mating in Captivity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (my go-to recommended read for these types of situations) explores how closeness is often at odds with eroticism. It wouldn’t be surprising at all if your wife were having similar issues. If you can have an honest (but considerate!) conversation about the underwhelming state of your sex life, you can begin a collaboration to get things back on track. This might mean trying things (like kink, toys, and roleplay) that you’ve been curious about but have been too timid to ask for. It might mean exploring consensual non-monogamy. It might mean putting into practice some of the distancing techniques that Perel writes about (such as moving your sex outside of your home to, say, a hotel with some kind of regularity). It might mean something as simple as enjoying porn together instead of watching it alone. It might mean ongoing conversations and/or enlisting the help of a couples counselor or sex therapist/coach.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, they might as well have cut off another organ. My erections are much less frequent and not the same as they used to be. I don’t think I can get hard enough for penetration (haven’t tried). Pills do nothing. Yet I still think about sex a lot, so the drive is there. Is this normal?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="186" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjna957f00243b78uqk3s12y@published"&gt;Sexual dysfunction is common in people who have undergone limb amputation. In a 2015 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26030200/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of people with a limb amputation in the Netherlands, the intro/review of previous literature points out that post amputation, people “may be confronted with a variety of sexual problems, such as problems with arousal and/or orgasm, due to both the physical and/or psychological consequences of a limb amputation.  Furthermore, depression, (sexual) performance anxiety and an altered body image may influence the amputee’s sexual adjustment. Moreover, pain related to the amputation and medication use (to treat this pain) may also affect both sexual interest and activity.” There is a lot stacked against you, and one of the findings of this study’s survey was that there was very little discussion of sexuality during the rehabilitation process. Again, this was a study of Dutch subjects, but it’s hard to believe that elsewhere is doing much better to support these patients. In this study, 56 percent of participants reported at least one sexual problem and 20 percent reported sexual dysfunction(s). The problems included sexual desire (31 percent), sexual arousal (25 percent), and orgasm (21 percent).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjna95cg00253b780lu1x163@published"&gt;A more recent &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28359182/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from 2018 of only people with lower limb amputations found that only half were sexually active, and of that group, about 60 percent were sexually dysfunctional. The study’s authors highlighted the need for psychological and psychosexual assessment and intervention after amputation. “Depression, anxiety and body image issues were significantly associated with sexual dysfunction in the current sample of individuals with lower limb amputation,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="143" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjna95fr00263b78eeuuqsbk@published"&gt;So yes, it’s hardly surprising that your erections aren’t what they used to be. Diabetes, also, can have detrimental effects on erection quality. You have tried pills, but you may need to look into other options like injectable ED meds (like Trimix) or even an implant. Have you been to therapy or sex coaching regarding your amputation and/or sexual dysfunction? That might also be helpful. You should search for a provider who specifically deals with amputation that is near you or otherwise reachable. You may also want to think about expanding your definition of sex to incorporate things that don’t require an erection—toys, roleplay, forms of BDSM and kink, dressing up, even talking dirty. Don’t give up on your search for a reliable erection, but this is an opportunity to think beyond that and to enter a realm that many take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s believed that the measure will also protect vulnerable patients from infection by measles, which is still surging in the Upstate, according to the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By taking this proactive step, we can help ensure our hospitals remain safe places for our patients to receive high-quality care,” Jacie Volkman, executive director of Prisma’s Department of Infection Prevention, said in the release. “Exceptions may be allowed for circumstances such as the imminent death of a loved one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More suggestions to prevent and protect against the flu, and other respiratory viruses, include frequent handwashing, and staying home or away from others while sick, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://dph.sc.gov/"&gt;South Carolina Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any visitors who feel sick should not visit hospitals. Additionally, it’s recommended that all visitors wear masks to help avoid the spread of respiratory illnesses, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;Flu season&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seasonal flu activity is increasing in most areas of the country, including South Carolina and Tennessee, where Prisma has hospital locations, according to the release. Nationwide, the &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; estimates that there have been at least 4.6 million illnesses, 49,000 hospitalizations and 1,900 deaths from flu so far this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current flu season started Sept. 28, according to the South Carolina Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/flu"&gt;Symptoms can include&lt;/a&gt; a sudden onset of fever, cough, headache or muscle aches, tiredness, sore throat and nasal congestion or stuffiness, the S.C. Department of Public Health said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://dph.sc.gov/sites/scdph/files/2025-12/2025-Flu-Watch-MMWR-WK-51.pdf"&gt;seven flu-related deaths&lt;/a&gt; this season in South Carolina, according to the state Department of Public Health. The Palmetto State has reported more than 6,100 cases of the flu, and has exceeded 700 hospitalizations, S.C. Department of Public Health data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="11" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;Prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the CDC and S.C. Department of Public Health recommend that everyone 6 months of age and older get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination to prevent flu is particularly important for people who are at increased risk of complications from flu, including young children, adults aged 50 years and older, pregnant women and people with certain chronic medical conditions, Prisma officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu vaccines offered at Department of Public Health clinics are available by appointment.

About half of that comes from beverages, but much of the rest is sneaked into cereal, salsa, prepared sandwiches, dairy products, bottled sauces and baked goods, including many brands of whole-grain bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ea3274" class="body-graf"&gt;To help control sugar intake, start by checking the nutrition label. Since 2021, food companies have been required to list the quantity of added sugars separately from total sugar content. But the plan backfired, Avena said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d3d9ff" class="body-graf"&gt;Companies reduced common sweeteners like refined beet sugar and high-fructose corn syrup but added alternatives, such as monk fruit and the sugar alcohol erythritol, which aren’t considered “added sugars” under FDA regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-622a60" class="body-graf"&gt;“Now our foods are even more sweet than they were back in 2020,” Avena said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-b21085" class="body-heading"&gt;What should you do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f2bc00" class="body-graf"&gt;Collin Popp, a dietitian and professor at NYU Langone Health, said the current FDA recommendation allows for some flexibility. People should get no more than 10% of their calories from added sugar, which amounts to about 50 grams per day if eating 2,000 calories, or a bit more than what’s in a typical can of soda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9e3502" class="body-graf"&gt;But that might be too flexible, Popp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2c5e2a" class="body-graf"&gt;“I would actually like to see that be less than 5%, and closer to zero for some, if they have diabetes or prediabetes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-23db2f" class="body-graf"&gt;The key is to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/food-safety"&gt;be mindful of what you’re eating&lt;/a&gt;, even if the product &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/28e626562c88439b96056e843215aa8d"&gt;seems healthy&lt;/a&gt; or if the package is labeled organic, Popp said. Roasted nuts, plant-based milks and wasabi peas, for example, can include a surprising amount of added sugars. So can English muffins and Greek yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b317d3" class="body-graf"&gt;One Chobani black cherry yogurt, for example, has zero grams of fat but 9 grams of added sugar, or more than 2 teaspoons. Silk brand almond milk has 7 grams per cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b28053" class="body-graf"&gt;Popp recommends taking control of how much sugar goes into your food. That could mean buying plain yogurt and adding honey or berries, or asking the barista if you can put your own oat milk into your coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-311372" class="body-heading"&gt;Taking from one column to add to another&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e05cdd" class="body-graf"&gt;Although they lower the calorie content of foods, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/coke-cane-sugar-corn-syrup-better-d7a70ebd4aef1564e409dd087f6a69c3"&gt;artificial sweeteners&lt;/a&gt; like stevia and sugar alcohols may not be better because they can encourage people to overeat, Avena said. She said research shows that sweet flavors are what activate the reward center of the brain, not the sugar itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-57ead7" class="body-graf"&gt;That’s not to write off sugar alternatives, including allulose for people with Type 1 diabetes since it doesn’t affect blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c63c93" class="body-graf"&gt;But for the general public, minimizing dependence on the overall sweetness of food is key to improving health, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-093690" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Don’t let the food companies decide how much sugar you’re eating,” Avena said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 16:40:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQRXdZdFBxYlpCdHc5bExyaDNTVm1PYmx1TU1CczlTck1MVkNEeHVmVXBWdjdwTjdabWV2TDByYVE3Wm5YM2dWTENKYVFSVHZqNVc4cG5uMzZtUWNfODVfcVZTWE1GS05SSk9aWV9UUTdUQTh4blFXVFN4QzNZZ2RWMVBNREXSAVZBVV95cUxNbkZoN2p1blhKY3pGdFdPcndzNU1RbXFzbDV1cGtFS2lGNGxLakpZTTJQeVZZUEhPTmwtMzZTcmRNQ18zMGZZdnpVY3d6UGVyMUhMdmEzQQ</guid></item><item><title>流感比过去2年更严重、更早。新泽西州的水平已经“非常高”。- NJ.com</title><link>https://www.nj.com/healthfit/2025/12/flu-hitting-harder-and-earlier-than-past-2-years-levels-in-nj-already-at-very-high.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5OT7WMBL2BGBLFBZAFD4JKFXOQ"&gt;Sick for the holidays with fever, chills and muscle aches?

He claimed nearly three-quarters of his patients have improved since beginning an exercise regimen.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'The psychoanalytic way of thinking has always been that there were other approaches other than the use of medications,' said Gilberg, who also helps A-list actors delve into the minds of their characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You get some benefit from the medication, but it does have a numbing effect… that's why I'm very reluctant about them.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Arnold Gilberg (pictured) is a leading psychiatrist at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles and trained psychoanalyst who is reluctant to prescribe antidepressants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gilberg's method of treating patients with mild to severe anxiety and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-e67d12d0-d799-11f0-a57f-b5ccfc25dd93"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; was shaped by the teachings of his mentor Franz Alexander, a psychoanalyst who learned the theories and techniques from Sigmund Freud himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alexander, who is widely considered the father of psychosomatic medicine, instilled in Gilberg the importance of treating the whole person within the context of their life, not just a set of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During a patient's first 50-minute session at Gilberg's office, the primary focus is delving into current crises they are experiencing rather than exclusively exploring more profound childhood trauma. This might be a divorce, bereavement, problems with a child or job stress, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gilberg is also a big fan of yoga, framing it as an 'opportunity' for patients to actively participate in their own healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm very holistic,' he told the Daily Mail. 'I encourage all my patients to do yoga and meditate, and there are all these modalities of care that we have available to us.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise acts as a powerful, natural antidepressant by increasing the brain's production of endorphins and other mood-regulating neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also reduces the body's stress hormones, such as cortisol and adrenaline, helping to alleviate both depression and anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Harvard researchers reported in 2019 that committing to a manageable bout of exercise, such as 15 minutes of brisk walking, can reduce the risk of depression &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/more-evidence-that-exercise-can-boost-mood"&gt;by 26 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This isn't to say that Gilberg and other psychoanalysts have stopped rooting out trauma.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead they address the most immediate problem, such as a sudden loss, first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We all have traumas in development. That's just the way it goes,' he said, describing a foundational Freudian concept. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And as a psychoanalyst, over time, you do explore those issues. But when a person's going through an acute trauma, that's not the time to start peeling away at the onion.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So essentially, he seeks to put out the fire first and find the cause later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Freud believed the mind was a fortress that guarded painful memories and secrets rooted in traumatic experiences, which the psyche buried deep in your subconscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Recent data indicates over 47 million American adults currently have or are being treated for depression, while statistics show over 21 million adults and five million adolescents experienced a depressive episode in the past year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Between 2009 and 2018, antidepressant use rose significantly among women, climbing from 13.8 percent to 18.6 percent. For men, however, the rate remained relatively stable, rising only slightly from 7.1 percent to 8.7 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He theorized that when these memories broke through the mind's defenses, they manifested as symptoms like anxiety or dissociation from your body or surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The path to healing, in Freud's view, was slow, deliberate work facing scarring memories head-on. The goal was to gently unearth this unconscious material and integrate it into a conscious narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Today's psychoanalytic thinking is different,' said Gilberg, who is also the author of &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Aging-Prescription-Emotional-Well-Being/dp/B0FKN9WVMS"&gt;The Myth of Aging: A Prescription for Emotional and Physical Well-Being&lt;/a&gt;. 'We're not interested in going back to what happened when they were a child, but we want to stay on top of what's going on now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So we explore how badly he or she feels. We want to talk about what they're doing to make things a bit better.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gilberg has not shunned antidepressants completely, and acknowledges they can be 'worthwhile and good options' for severe, biologically rooted conditions such as major depression or bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he worries that pills have gone from being just one facet of a mental health treatment plan, which typically includes regular therapy, to the default approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Uptake of antidepressants has risen steadily for decades, particularly since the 1987 release of Prozac, the world's first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prescriptions of SSRIs and similar SNRIs (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) soared in the years that followed. Americans filled 42 million prescriptions in 2010, a figure that rose 108 percent to more than 88 million by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In 2010, Americans filled 42 million SSRI or SNRI prescriptions - this number surged by 108 percent to more than 88 million by 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While I believe in antidepressants for major illnesses like bipolar and schizophrenia, I have been concerned about the use of antidepressants, which are dished out so easily, because of the impact they have on the individual,' Gilberg told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that SSRIs have been used so widely that they have become not just the default treatment approach among many doctors but among patients as well - many of whom have been led to think they cannot solve internal conflicts through non-medical modes like psychotherapy, or that they will provide a quick fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think that for myself, anyway, we have to be very discriminating about how we use the medications that we have available to us, because the medications themselves have side effects,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many patients taking the medications experience sexual dysfunction, including low libido, delayed orgasm or numbness, which can strain relationships and lower quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other frequent complaints include weight gain, feeling detached or less responsive - known as emotional blunting - and digestive issues like nausea or constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While not everyone is affected, he said these side effects are common enough for around a quarter of patients to stop taking their medication as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;You can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;pre-order Gilberg's new book&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;, The Myth of Aging: A Prescription for Emotional and Physical Well-Being, out on January 13, 2026. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Some are triumphant—like the time I hosted my entire MFA cohort with a DIY &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2019/03/02/crispy-creamy-loaded-baked-potatoes-recipe-fully-loaded_partner/"&gt;baked potato&lt;/a&gt; bar and some donated &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/01/21/no-time-for-celebration-champagne-sales-are-reportedly-on-the-decline-new-report-finds/"&gt;champagne.&lt;/a&gt; Others are sadder: the week a breakup coincided with unexpected medical bills, when I stood at the self-checkout feeding $23 worth of quarters (my last money until payday, and yes, it takes exactly as long as you’re imagining) into the machine so I could buy &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/06/20/alton-brown-good-eats-grilling-pantry-salon-talks/"&gt;chicken thighs&lt;/a&gt;, vegetables and rice. All I wanted then was to sink into a pot of chicken-and-rice stew and weep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is different. This one is about quiet confidence — the sort that only comes from surviving enough $23-in-quarters days to know you’ll be okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It began innocently. I’d swapped handbags for the season — a slouchy straw tote with a teak handle traded for a forest-green suede pouch — and my wallet, apparently, hadn’t gotten the memo. Because of my deep and abiding distrust of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/01/31/a-patriot-economy-media-expands-into-fintech-with-truthfi/"&gt;fintech&lt;/a&gt; (a story for another day), I keep a little emergency cash tucked into my bags. Still, there I was in the supermarket, wallet-less, armed with $12, a dying phone and my transit card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a moment, I panicked. And then I didn’t. I realized I had everything I needed to get home and make a good dinner. What, exactly, was I pressed about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started in the produce aisle, as I often do, scanning the marked-down netted bags — imperfect, but still sturdy and fragrant. I grabbed one with a few &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/12/25/how-to-make-savory-sweet-shallot-jam-with-three-ingredients_partner/"&gt;shallots &lt;/a&gt;and a &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/03/19/youre-cooking-with-one-onion-you-should-be-cooking-with-four/"&gt;head of garlic&lt;/a&gt;, added a carton of cheap white mushrooms, then a ninety-nine-cent box of pasta, a small wedge of Parm from Murray’s “under $5” bin and a carton of six eggs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back home, after the train ride, I washed and dried the mushrooms and sent them sizzling into a pan with shallots, garlic, salt, pepper and an indecent amount of smoked paprika. They crisped and darkened, developing a savory depth that stood in happily for pork. Tossed with pasta, egg, cheese, and a little of the starchy cooking water, they became a mushroom &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2021/04/24/my-10-year-carbonara-journey/"&gt;carbonara&lt;/a&gt;—rich, smoky, and deeply satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt decadent. And there was enough for two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep thinking about that meal, especially because this year has been rough. Groceries cost more, time feels thinner and the idea that eating well — both pleasurable and nourishing — should be attainable on a modest budget can feel almost quaint. As we head into a new year, many of us are doing the same math over and over: trying to square taste with nutrition, care with constraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this feels familiar —if you’re feeling tired, hungry and underpaid all at once—let me just say: you’re not imagining it. You’re not alone. I’ve teared up in grocery aisles myself, realizing the little treat I’d budgeted for (or some weeks, the extra bit of meat) wasn’t actually in the cards. I’ve experimented extensively with how far a pot of chicken-and-rice stew can stretch with just a little extra broth. I’ve taken two trains to pick up &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/11/30/too-good-to-go-the-second-life-of-leftovers/"&gt;Too Good To Go &lt;/a&gt;leftovers from restaurants I couldn’t normally afford. I could tell you a dozen ways to use Bisquick to fill out a meal — and I’m fairly certain I could discover a dozen more.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing: good food doesn’t have to be expensive. We know this, even if it’s easy to forget. There is something elementally heavenly about the smell of alliums cooking in butter. Spoon it over a comforting bulk grain — pasta, rice, polenta, &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/05/30/everything-you-need-to-know-about-growing-beans_partner/"&gt;beans&lt;/a&gt; — top it with a single egg, and it will set you right almost every time. You can scale up if you like: some grated cheese, a scatter of fresh herbs, maybe crispy pork. But you don’t have to. Sometimes, that restraint is the nicest thing you can do for Future You.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows are a few principles I’ve learned for cooking this way. Not perfectly, but with steadiness, pleasure and budget in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nurture a rolodex of “rent week” recipes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a special kind of comfort in having a short list of meals you know, with almost mathematical certainty, will land. In the culinary world, this is often called “rent week” cooking—a term popularized by Alex Delaney in &lt;a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/misc/rent-week?srsltid=AfmBOoqPezkgb7NaXpjfChEJP2XkPOxgmqobSrar3fhCyi5j0FBSrWUi"&gt;his Bon Appétit column &lt;/a&gt;from 2016 to 2019. Delaney’s recipes had a magic trick: they were cheap, fast, and reliably delicious. Think “&lt;a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/overdraft-protection-polenta?srsltid=AfmBOopUkOqvJx71Rw2GKhFLWlFjvjXQUIT5zyIhaNEL9AjBs3EhtyQR"&gt;overdraft-protection polenta&lt;/a&gt;” or a “&lt;a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/rent-week-chorizo-tostada?srsltid=AfmBOoqzeevK15fXCuzfN6N8o7m9l5xw6HD9YBIIZuPQATTXvrkm-E8y"&gt;cheap chorizo tostada&lt;/a&gt;” — meals that somehow still felt cheffy, like a little wink at your former foodie ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered that column shortly after graduating, when my love of food far outstripped my paycheck in public media. It hit just at the right time. For me, my own rent-week roster looks like the mushroom carbonara I’ve told you about, a smoky chickpea curry, feta-eggs on rice with avocado slices, or a black bean stew that can stretch either with a bit of chorizo or a rotisserie chicken scavenged from the sale bin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point isn’t perfection—it’s predictability, pleasure, and the quiet relief of knowing that, even when the week is long and the budget short, dinner is still a thing you can get right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learn the rhythms of your grocery store&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every supermarket has a secret life, if you know how to watch. There’s a cadence to sales, a pattern to coupons, a small ecosystem of rewards programs and “oops” bins where imperfect or surplus food waits quietly for someone to notice. At my Mariano’s, there’s a section labeled “Oops! We baked too much,” which houses overstock bread and &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/10/14/fig-jam-hand-pies-for-the-hesitant-host/"&gt;pastries&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also a section for imperfect produce, as well as a tiny corner of discounted meat, like a tiny treasure trove for those paying attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about snagging a deal; it’s about knowing where the value is and when. Some stores have unbeatable per-unit prices on pantry staples, while others shine with proteins or prepared items. The Vietnamese grocery down my street, for example, always has the best Jasmine rice and canned coconut milk, though the protein prices are steeper. Knowing this allows me to plan trips that actually make sense: sometimes it’s worth a detour for a specialty ingredient, other times it’s smarter to stick to one store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it like learning the rhythm of your own kitchen, except bigger, louder, and fluorescent-lit: once you understand it, your budget stretches in ways that feel almost effortless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Plan a little for Future You&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit it: I am a dork about pre-planning. I keep a household binder that I update quarterly, a habit that became strangely essential while recovering from lingering post-COVID brain fog. One section is devoted entirely to food, subdivided into tiny compartments of order: nutrition goals for the quarter, menus and budgets for holidays or birthdays, recipes I want to try (already printed and annotated with shopping lists), and finally, the pièce de résistance—my quarterly dinner queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dinner queue is a concept I first encountered in Kendra Adachi’s “&lt;a href="https://www.thelazygeniuscollective.com/kitchen"&gt;The Lazy Genius Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;.” It’s deceptively simple: a curated list of meals you intend to make for dinner. You might be thinking, “Isn’t the whole internet a list? Aren’t all my cookbooks lists?” Yes, but those lists are too big. Overwhelming. And overwhelm is the state in which I make most of my bad financial decisions. Adachi &lt;a href="https://www.thelazygeniuscollective.com/lazy/falldinners"&gt;puts it beautifully&lt;/a&gt;: “A dinner queue can be ten meals you repeat, thirty meals you do for an entire month and repeat, or maybe even more than that if you’re not a fan of repetition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need a binder or a full-blown quarterly system to reap the benefits. Even a little pre-planning—whether for a week, a month, or a cooking “season”—lets you approach dinner with confidence, reduces stress, and keeps your budget in mind without having to reinvent every meal from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But stay flexible (and realistic)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some nights, you come home late on a snowy evening and the last thing you want to do is make whatever dinner you had meticulously planned. That’s when a little self-compassion—and a small arsenal of freezer and pantry favorites—becomes your secret weapon. &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/11/26/let-trader-joes-help-you-plan-a-budget-thanksgiving-dinner-for-30/"&gt;Trader Joe’s &lt;/a&gt;orange chicken. A bag of dumplings. Stouffer’s lasagna. White cheddar shells. Even a frozen pizza that’s not quite artisanal but somehow perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These “easy wins” bridge the gap between exhaustion and sustenance without forcing you to spend $72 on a pair of sad burrito bowls from a takeout app. The trick is building a little wiggle room in your budget for them—so that a fallback meal feels like a relief, not a splurge. Flexibility isn’t about throwing plans out the window; it’s about giving Future You the kindness and tools needed to survive the week with dignity, warmth and, yes, occasional cheese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nerd out on technique&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a surprising joy to be found in coaxing the absolute most from humble ingredients—if you can be bothered to notice. Stewing a piece of meat until it transforms from leather into something tender and succulent. Turning the odds and ends of vegetables—peels, stems, bruised bits—into a fragrant stock that makes even weeknight soup feel luxurious. Toasting spices in oil until they bloom and scent the kitchen with something almost magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not about impressing anyone. It’s about seeing potential in the ordinary, finding pleasure in the small transformations and discovering that even the simplest ingredients can carry a richness you’d almost forgotten was possible. Technique is not a chore. It’s a quiet way to honor your food, your time and Future You.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Give everything a second life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite lessons came from a restaurant manager at a small, hip café: “Give everything a second life.” It sounds obvious, but it’s amazing how often we toss what could be treasure. Take carrots, for instance. Carrot peels became stock. Extra shredded carrots were saved for &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/10/28/a-better-pumpkin-bread-made-with-coffee-citrus-and-chocolate/"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt; or pickled for a salad. Carrot tops were transformed into pesto. Nothing went to waste and everything found a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carleigh Bodrug’s “&lt;a href="https://plantyou.com/category/scrappy-cooking/"&gt;Scrappy Cooking&lt;/a&gt;” and Tamar Adler’s “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Everlasting-Meal-Cookbook-Leftovers-Z/dp/1476799660"&gt;The Everlasting Meal Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;” are brilliant companions for this mindset, offering clever, unexpected ways to elevate what might otherwise be scraps. It turns the ordinary into something that feels thoughtful, deliberate, and yes—a little magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Build a solid pantry, bit by bit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to grow up in a household where basics were taken for granted, which made adulthood a bit of a shock: decent toilet paper, a shower curtain that doesn’t disintegrate in the wash, a rug that actually fits under the bed — all these small necessities suddenly had a cost. But the real challenge, and the real joy, was building a pantry beyond salt, pepper and oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the honest truth: the difference between a budget meal that tastes like one and one that doesn’t is often just time (a soup simmered for 90 minutes instead of 15 will taste richer) and decent spices. It’s worth investing slowly. International markets often have the best deals on spices, but your local supermarket can surprise you too — especially during holiday or New Year sales. For nonperishables, picking up an extra can or two of beans, a jar of tomato paste, or a staple oil can quietly change the trajectory of your weeknight cooking. Even dedicating a small portion of your grocery budget — $20 a month, say — to new spices, vinegars or oils can steadily bolster your collection, making your pantry a toolkit for meals that feel abundant, not scrappy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Master a few “fridge clean-out” meals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a different beast from your rent-week recipes, but just as essential. The idea is simple: have a few go-to templates for using up the bibs and bobs lurking in your kitchen, depending on your mood and what’s in the crisper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/06/05/the-frittata-that-bought-us-a_partner/"&gt;frittatas&lt;/a&gt; or egg bakes, perfect for dispatching vegetable scraps, wilting herbs, bits of cheese or that lone slice of bacon that’s been begging for a job. Or a &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/01/24/cozy-up-to-this-new-chicken-and-wild-mushroom-stew-with-schmaltzy-croutons/"&gt;sturdy stew&lt;/a&gt;: a can of tomatoes, an errant link of sausage, a handful of chickpeas, all brightened with greens that need a home. Stir-fries, &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/11/13/better-oatmeal-made-at-home/"&gt;savory oats&lt;/a&gt;, rice bowls, flatbreads, &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/08/19/i-rescued-a-panini-press-it-saved-dinner/"&gt;paninis,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/11/18/a-magical-maple-pumpkin-pasta-sauce/"&gt;pasta&lt;/a&gt;—whatever suits your style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The joy of these meals is in their freedom: they’re forgiving, flexible, and somehow deeply satisfying. Fridge clean-out cooking turns potential waste into dinner that feels intentional, resourceful and, above all, comforting.&lt;/p&gt;

Read on to discover why the timing of your coffee intake matters for how well you're aging and how many benefits you can get from your sip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://sph.tulane.edu/epid/lu-qi" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lu Qi, M.D., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lu Qi, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, professor at the Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Tulane University; &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/melissa-ann-prest" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Melissa Mroz-Planells, D.C.N., R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Melissa Mroz-Planells, D.C.N., R.D.N.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, national media spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and member of the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/about/g26577234/medical-review-board/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Prevention Medical Review Board;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt; Medical Review Board&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://baptisthealth.net/doctors/adedapo-adeyinka-iluyomade/2103193" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Adedapo Iluyomade, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adedapo Iluyomade, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, preventative cardiologist with Baptist Health Miami Cardiac &amp;amp; Vascular Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae871/7928425?login=false" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:European Heart Journal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; looked into the timing of drinking &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a69286619/is-coffee-actually-good-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:coffee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; and how it relates to longevity. The analysis involved 40,725 adults in the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1999 and 2018, in which participants were asked about all the food and drink they consumed on at least one day, including whether they drank coffee, how much, and when. It also included a sub-group of 1,463 people who were asked to complete a detailed food and drink diary for a full week. This information was then linked with records of deaths and causes of death over a period of nine to 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that compared with people who did not drink coffee, morning coffee drinkers were 16% less likely to die of any cause and 31% less likely to die of cardiovascular disease. However, there was no reduction in risk for all-day coffee drinkers compared to non-coffee drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morning coffee drinkers were found to have a lower risk of all-cause mortality and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a69277325/top-heart-disease-risk-factors/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, whether they had two to three cups per day or more than three cups. In comparison, those who had one cup or less in the morning benefitted from a smaller decrease in risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings indicate that it’s not just whether you drink coffee or how much you drink, but the time of day when you drink coffee that’s important,” senior study author &lt;a href="https://sph.tulane.edu/epid/lu-qi" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lu Qi, M.D., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lu Qi, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, professor at the Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Tulane University said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1069398" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:news release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;news release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We don’t typically give advice about timing in our dietary guidance,” Dr. Qi continued, “but perhaps we should be thinking about this in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how does coffee benefit health? In addition to making you feel upbeat and energized, coffee also contains phenolic acid and flavonoids—antioxidants that protect your body from the damage caused by free radicals, said &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/melissa-ann-prest" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Melissa Mroz-Planells, D.C.N., R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Melissa Mroz-Planells, D.C.N., R.D.N.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, national media spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and member of the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/about/g26577234/medical-review-board/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Prevention Medical Review Board;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt; Medical Review Board&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, this study suggests that morning coffee consumption, as opposed to an all-day pattern, may be linked to even lower risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. “This association may be due to coffee’s interaction with circadian rhythms," said &lt;a href="https://baptisthealth.net/doctors/adedapo-adeyinka-iluyomade/2103193" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Adedapo Iluyomade, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adedapo Iluyomade, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, preventative cardiologist with Baptist Health Miami Cardiac &amp;amp; Vascular Institute. "Consuming caffeine later in the day can &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/a69197866/melatonin-vs-magnesium-for-sleep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:disrupt sleep patterns;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;disrupt sleep patterns&lt;/a&gt; and melatonin secretion, potentially negating some of its health benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having coffee earlier in the day is usually recommended so as not to disrupt your circadian rhythm, agreed Mroz-Planells, as “poor sleep quality and lack of sleep can affect your health and wellbeing.” A study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38007301/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sleep Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sleep Health&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;even found that poor sleep quality was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality among middle-aged and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study highlights that both the timing and amount of coffee you drink matter when assessing its health benefits, said Dr. Iluyomade. “Regular, moderate coffee intake in the morning appears to confer a greater protective effect against cardiovascular and overall mortality compared to sporadic or late-day consumption, emphasizing the importance of aligning dietary habits with natural circadian rhythms,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee’s health benefits are not limited to cardiovascular protection, Dr. Iluyomade continued. “Moderate intake has also been linked to a reduced risk of several chronic conditions, including type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and neurodegenerative diseases.” However, these associations are based on observational data, so individuals should consider their own tolerance and response to caffeine, he pointed out. Either way, if you like to start your day with a cup or two of coffee, feel free to keep at it—just consider switching to other beverages like water later in the day to get the most health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 15:25:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE8wV2dOT3hYY3FRTjhpUFc5Uk9BRmNGaHFhd2hxYm5VQzBhWjJ6WE5VZHY4dUNNRWNiS0pRMnhEM1VhcjdTd1B5T3A2c29GdUFNX1kwTTdNUEtRcldHR0VDemFxTUxtOF9DaVF6dVg5bGxvazlmV015a1Fn</guid></item><item><title>医生揭示了可以帮助您长寿的早餐习惯- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/breakfast-habit-to-live-longer-11870650</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A doctor says eating a breakfast with protein, fiber and healthy fat may help you live longer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This formula helps manage blood sugar, fights inflammation and protects against weight gain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For more benefits, add berries, veggies and probiotic-containing foods to your breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Breakfast sets the stage for your day ahead, which is why doctors recommend eating a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7874786/best-healthy-breakfast-foods-to-eat/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy, satisfying morning meal&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, what does this look like? It starts with protein. “A protein-forward breakfast is one of the simplest ways to protect your metabolism and long-term health,” Dal Farra says. You can get that protein from eggs, strained (Greek-style) yogurt, beans, tofu, smoked salmon or even tuna fish or turkey. For healthy fats, we have olive oil, avocado, nuts, nut butter and seeds. And for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11775341" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber, focus on whole grains, fruits and veggies&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Going on a blood sugar roller coaster first thing in the morning doesn’t feel great—and it doesn’t do your body good in the long term either. “A cornerstone of longevity is stable blood sugar, which will protect your heart and brain health over time,” says Dal Farra.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As she explains, repeated glucose spikes will push insulin levels higher, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7902105/stress-causing-inflammation-what-you-can-do-about-it/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increasing inflammation and oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; that can cause vascular damage and accelerate cellular aging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Breakfast is a key meal that sets the tone for your blood sugar patterns throughout the day,” she says. That’s where protein and healthy fats come in. Both these nutrients are digested gradually, helping to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8066203/habit-to-break-insulin-resistance/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;slow the absorption of carbs&lt;/a&gt; from your meal and keeping blood sugar on an even keel throughout the morning.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein, fat and fiber are a powerful hunger-quashing trio that work together to help you feel full, says Dal Farra.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And feeling satiated and satisfied after a meal can help you &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2056824/16-weight-loss-tips-and-tricks-that-actually-work-according-to-dietitians/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;maintain a healthy weight&lt;/a&gt;. Gaining weight with age, on the other hand, has been linked to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7898812/how-food-can-help-you-look-and-feel-more-youthful-heres-what-the-science-says/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;faster biological aging in women&lt;/a&gt;—speeding up cellular aging by several years.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Fiber Supports Healthy Aging &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; White toast, granola bars, sweetened cereal, pancakes and waffles are go-to breakfast foods for many of us. Although all foods can have their place in a healthy eating pattern, a heavy intake of these kinds of refined carbohydrates (or “naked carbs,” as Dal Farra likes to call them) has been linked to a lower odds of healthy aging. On the other hand, research has shown that focusing on fiber-rich carbohydrates from foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains is associated with a greater likelihood of healthy aging.&lt;span data-cite="10" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the easiest ways to work some fiber into your morning is with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/our-best-high-fiber-overnight-oats-recipes-11744812" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bowl of oatmeal, overnight oats or unsweetened whole-grain cereal&lt;/a&gt;. But when you don’t have time for a sit-down breakfast at home, grab an apple, an orange or a pear to eat with your breakfast later. They’re &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/our-best-high-fiber-snack-recipes-11727352" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high in fiber and easy to take on the go&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fat may help keep you full. However, the type you choose matters—a lot. Research suggests that saturated fat, in foods like butter, cream cheese, pastries, sausage and bacon, may speed up cellular aging. On the flip side, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/swap-to-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-diabetes-8679543" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt; may help slow down the aging process in our cells, possibly by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-inflammation-ages-you-8744048" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reducing damaging inflammation and oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span data-cite="11" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You can get these healthy fats from avocados, olive oil, nuts, nut butter, seeds, smoked salmon and herring and even eggs. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat breakfast in the first place: &lt;/strong&gt;One meta-analysis of more than 2 million people found that those who &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-skip-breakfast-8417958" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;skipped breakfast&lt;/a&gt; were 17% more likely to develop cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease and stroke, than those who ate a morning meal regularly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;So, try to eat something, even if it’s just a container of yogurt with a handful of nuts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serve up a side of berries: &lt;/strong&gt;Whether it’s strawberries, blueberries, raspberries or blackberries, people who eat berries are 21% less likely to die from any cause than people who don’t eat these fruits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; Experts suspect this is due to berries’ &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-antioxidant-packed-foods-11813913" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;ample antioxidant compounds called flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;. Berries are also a tasty way to score extra fiber.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add a source of probiotics: &lt;/strong&gt;Foods that contain probiotics (live microbes), like yogurt and kefir, may help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290445/3-foods-to-ditch-for-a-healthy-gut/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;improve the microbial environment in your gut&lt;/a&gt;. This improved gut health may reduce inflammation, which is one reason why consuming these probiotic-rich foods may help slow biological aging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a serving of vegetables: &lt;/strong&gt;Getting your five-a-day really &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;important. This magic number is associated with a lower risk of death from any cause, especially cardiovascular disease, cancer and respiratory disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, if you really want to get granular, researchers say the best way to break it down is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290393/what-does-a-day-of-fruits-and-vegetables-look-like/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;three daily servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit&lt;/a&gt;. Given that most of us eat three meals daily, aim to get one serving of veggies at breakfast, and you’ll be well on your way to shoring up your body’s natural disease-fighting defenses. &lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM (VINnews) — Prof. Yifat Merbl, a researcher from the Department of Systems Immunology at the Weizmann Institute of Science, is summing up an almost unimaginable year, as reported by Israel’s Channel 12. At the age of 48, at the height of a complex and turbulent period in Israel, she was selected by the prestigious journal Nature as one of the ten people who shaped the face of science in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong class="whatsapp-promotion-mobile"&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery that brought her to the forefront of global attention concerns a new immune mechanism hidden within the process of protein degradation in the body. Prof. Merbl chose to study what she calls the cell’s “trash cans” — the place where proteins are broken down and shredded. She discovered that some of the fragments produced in this process are capable of directly fighting bacteria, a finding described as a “gold mine” for the development of potential antibiotics and innovative cancer therapies. Speaking about her persistence in pursuing the research despite skepticism around her, she said: “In the end, what determines everything is natural curiosity and passion — and I wasn’t willing to give that up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Prof. Merbl’s path to the top of academia was far from conventional. Numerous certificates hang in her office, but one is conspicuously missing: a high school matriculation certificate. In her youth, the education system failed to accommodate her. In 10th grade, she was told she was unfit for the framework, and in 11th grade it was decided not to allow her to take the matriculation exams, including in chemistry, a field in which she is now deeply engaged. She left school with a deep sense of failure and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, she was considered “wasted potential,” as she describes it, and worked in temporary jobs. The turning point came when she scored 752 on the psychometric exam (out of a maximum 800 points), a result that surprised even herself. From there began an impressive academic journey: from studies in computational biology at Bar-Ilan University to a PhD at the prestigious Harvard University. Despite her success, feelings of not belonging and fear of failure accompanied her throughout the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only at the age of 43 was Prof. Merbl formally diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). She said that had she been diagnosed earlier, she might have spared herself much suffering, but today she understands that her different way of perceiving reality may have enabled her to find scientific solutions in places where others did not think to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past year posed both physical and political challenges for Prof. Merbl’s laboratory. Last summer, an Iranian missile struck the laboratory building at the Weizmann Institute directly, completely destroying the equipment on which her research depended. She did not give up: she ran to the ruined building in flip-flops to salvage whatever she could, and within less than two months, she had reestablished a fully functioning laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside the physical destruction, Prof. Merbl is also contending with the academic boycott of Israel. She described cases in which Israeli researchers were excluded from research grants and invitations to conferences were made conditional on future approval of Israeli participation. Nevertheless, as a Zionist and a former military officer, she is determined to continue her work in Israel. For her, the goal is clear: “The question is not whether we will leave, but how we will make it happen here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Merbl’s vision for the future is especially ambitious. She aims to establish an international center that will leverage research into protein quality-control mechanisms to treat severe diseases such as Alzheimer’s and cancer. She is no longer afraid to set lofty goals and hopes to achieve breakthroughs that will have a tangible impact on humanity. When asked about the possibility of winning a Nobel Prize in the future, she admitted it would be an immense source of pride for the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her story has become a source of inspiration for many parents and children struggling with similar difficulties in the education system. After Nature published its list, she received moving messages from parents thanking her for the hope she gave their children. She emphasized that “it’s allowed not to succeed, but it’s forbidden not to try,” and encouraged the younger generation to hold fast to their curiosity and passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, when asked what she would say to 16-year-old Yifat Merbl who had been expelled from school, she answered simply: “Well done. I’m proud of you.”&lt;/p&gt;

Prescribing information for losartan, a popular medication for high blood pressure, does not warn of tremor as a side effect. We found one case report in the medical literature, but that man developed the problem early in treatment (Cureus, Dec. 13, 2019). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="N2HB7XHCABEHLMC6HRVUYA7AX4"&gt;The most prescribed blood pressure medicine in the U.S. is lisinopril. Like losartan, it acts on the Renin-Angiotensin system to relax blood vessels and lower blood pressure. We have received a number of reports from people who have experienced hand tremor associated with lisinopril.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VQMTVPP6SFBQBGB5LFPVZQNJOE"&gt;One reader wrote: “I have been taking lisinopril for the last six months and started having hand tremors.

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, sugar substitutes have gained broad acceptance in public health circles, widely used in low-calorie diets and diabetes management. One compound in particular has become a mainstay of the growing market for “sugar-free” and “keto-friendly” products, appearing in everything from soft drinks to protein bars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It offers the sweetness of sugar without the calories, spikes in blood glucose, or digestive discomfort associated with other sugar alcohols. Approved by major food safety agencies, it has become one of the most common artificial sweeteners on the global market.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet behind this nutritional convenience lies a set of biological questions that have not been fully resolved. A series of recent studies suggests that the compound may not be entirely passive in the body’s vascular system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New research now adds detailed insight into how this sweetener may interact with the cells lining the blood vessels of the brain, raising further interest from the scientific community and health authorities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Early Signs of Cellular Stress&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A research team at the &lt;strong&gt;University of Colorado Boulder&lt;/strong&gt; investigated the effects of &lt;strong&gt;erythritol&lt;/strong&gt;, a low-calorie sugar alcohol, on &lt;strong&gt;human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hCMECs)&lt;/strong&gt;. These specialised cells form the inner lining of blood vessels in the brain and are essential for regulating blood flow, inflammation, and clotting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, exposed the cells to a level of erythritol equivalent to a single 30-gram serving, similar to what would be found in a standard artificially sweetened drink.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Within three hours, the cells exhibited a sharp increase in &lt;strong&gt;reactive oxygen species (ROS)&lt;/strong&gt;, a form of oxidative stress linked to cellular damage. The ROS level rose by 204 percent compared to untreated cells. To counter this, the cells elevated levels of &lt;strong&gt;superoxide dismutase-1&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;catalase&lt;/strong&gt;, enzymes that serve as antioxidant defences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite this response, the oxidative stress remained high. The research team identified it as a possible trigger for subsequent changes in cell function, indicating that erythritol exposure could initiate biochemical strain even in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Vascular Signalling Imbalances&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond oxidative stress, the study observed changes in the cells’ ability to regulate &lt;strong&gt;nitric oxide (NO)&lt;/strong&gt;, a gas molecule that supports blood vessel dilation. Although the total amount of the enzyme &lt;strong&gt;endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)&lt;/strong&gt; remained unchanged, its function was altered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Phosphorylation of the enzyme at two regulatory sites was disrupted. This shift resulted in a 20 percent decrease in nitric oxide output, reducing the cells’ capacity to signal for vessel relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;

These findings support a shift toward blood vessel constriction&lt;em&gt;. Credit: Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At the same time, production of &lt;strong&gt;endothelin-1 (ET-1)&lt;/strong&gt;, a peptide that prompts blood vessels to contract, increased by approximately 30 percent. Levels of &lt;strong&gt;Big ET-1&lt;/strong&gt;, a precursor form of the molecule, were also elevated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the findings show that erythritol exposure changed the balance of vasodilation and vasoconstriction signals in the brain’s microvascular system. These effects may reduce the brain’s ability to maintain consistent blood flow, particularly in contexts where vascular stability is already compromised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Altered Clot Response Under Lab Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test the sweetener’s effect on clot regulation, the researchers added &lt;strong&gt;thrombin&lt;/strong&gt;, a clotting signal, to both treated and untreated cell cultures. In normal cells, this stimulus produced a 25 percent increase in &lt;strong&gt;tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA)&lt;/strong&gt;, a protein involved in dissolving clots.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the erythritol-treated cells, however, there was no measurable increase in t-PA. The failure to release additional t-PA under stimulation suggested a blunted clot-dissolving response, a pattern associated with heightened risk of &lt;strong&gt;thrombotic events&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though the study was conducted entirely in vitro, the results closely match vascular patterns often seen in the early stages of &lt;strong&gt;stroke&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;cerebrovascular dysfunction&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Supported by Population-Level Associations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These cellular-level findings align with earlier epidemiological work. A 2023 study involving more than 4,000 participants, published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02223-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, found that individuals with elevated blood levels of erythritol were more likely to experience &lt;strong&gt;heart attacks&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;strokes&lt;/strong&gt; over a three-year period. This association was independent of age, sex, and traditional cardiovascular risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same study included a controlled intervention in which volunteers ingested erythritol. Subsequent blood testing showed increased &lt;strong&gt;platelet reactivity&lt;/strong&gt;, a known precursor to clot formation. The results suggested a possible physiological pathway linking erythritol intake to cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In combination with the new cellular evidence, these population-based findings are fuelling further research into the vascular effects of non-nutritive sweeteners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Regulation, Exposure, and Unanswered Questions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Erythritol is classified as&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/overview-food-ingredients-additives-colors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; “Generally Recognised as Safe” (GRAS)&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;strong&gt;US Food and Drug Administration&lt;/strong&gt;, and is authorised for use in food and drinks by the &lt;strong&gt;European Food Safety Authority&lt;/strong&gt;. It occurs naturally in small quantities in fruits and fermented foods, but is typically consumed in much larger volumes as an additive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The compound is known to &lt;strong&gt;cross the blood-brain barrier&lt;/strong&gt;, making it capable of reaching the cells studied. Its metabolic profile also includes &lt;strong&gt;endogenous production&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning the body can generate erythritol internally via glucose metabolism, especially in the liver and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because erythritol is found in a wide range of sugar-free products, many consumers may ingest multiple servings per day. No official intake thresholds are currently in place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that their study did not investigate long-term or cumulative effects, nor did it assess health outcomes in living organisms. The data reflect immediate cellular responses to a single dose. Still, the biological mechanisms identified are consistent with processes involved in cerebrovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="189181d7-60c4-4480-b2d5-e81a672fcd0f"&gt;Jeffing has really had its moment this year. Not only do people seem to be obsessed with the run-walk technique, but it’s also versatile and can be turned into Jeffing-inspired workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-swapped-running-for-jeffing-for-a-week-and-now-im-hooked" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-swapped-running-for-jeffing-for-a-week-and-now-im-hooked"&gt;Jeffing technique &lt;/a&gt;was developed by US Olympian Jeff Galloway and involves running, then walking, then running again; the idea is that you can go further for longer using intervals. For runners, Galloway says it can keep you strong and encourages faster recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="189181d7-60c4-4480-b2d5-e81a672fcd0f-2"&gt;Taking inspiration from Jeffing, I created a workout you can do that involves absolutely no gym equipment — just you and your bodyweight. It takes just 25 minutes, so even if you find yourself locked into the family fun during the holiday season, you can take a slice of time back for yourself to get outdoors, feel the fresh air on your skin and move your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-what-is-the-25-minute-jeffing-workout" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-the-25-minute-jeffing-workout"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is the 25-minute Jeffing workout?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="08e02e9c-e700-41f6-b451-01e1864c2603"&gt;I did a similar &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/workouts/i-did-this-walking-workout-twice-a-week-when-i-couldnt-lift-weights-heres-what-happened" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/workouts/i-did-this-walking-workout-twice-a-week-when-i-couldnt-lift-weights-heres-what-happened"&gt;walking workout twice a week when I couldn’t lift weights &lt;/a&gt;and found it both motivating and challenging. You can decide on the intervals for yourself, but my colleague reported on Jeffing earlier this year and stated the typical routine involves 10-60 seconds of running, then 30 seconds of walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever you choose to do, just make sure you include intervals and change your pace noticeably so that the running efforts feel challenging and the recovery slows everything down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only will you build endurance, but shifting between intensities also shifts between your energy systems. For those who prefer more of a challenge, see if you can &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/heres-what-30-minutes-of-power-walking-can-do-to-your-body" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/heres-what-30-minutes-of-power-walking-can-do-to-your-body"&gt;power walk&lt;/a&gt; your intervals, which requires a pace of between 4 and 5.5 mph.

As per the physiotherapist, the muscle and connective tissues during cold temperatures have a tendency to tighten, making the stiffness much worse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;During winter, people also tend to become inactive. Dr Khuranna advised, “Moving the body gently and routinely can keep the joints fluid and eventually eliminate the discomfort.&lt;/span&gt; This is always done by emphasising consistency and not intensity.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How to manage?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/08/23/original/yogaa_1755958628258.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Gentle yoga helps to keep joints agile.

(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The psychotherapist suggested simple indoor activities that help keep your joints flexible and maintain mobility throughout the winter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Khuranna shared, “Do activities such as stretching, slow joint rotations, or short walks around the house.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Along with this, he also advised gentle yoga and guided mobility exercises, as they don't exert too much strain on the body while keeping the joints active.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But preparing your body before the activity is just as essential as the exercise itself. For this, Dr Khuranna recommended a hot shower, heating pad, or warm compress to relieve stiff muscles and ready the joints for movements. Along with this, wearing warm clothes, especially around vulnerable areas such as the knees, hands, and shoulders, can also help minimise stiffness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

The researchers noted, “The dietary portfolio group had a mean decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 28.6% (P&amp;lt;.001).” This is the original portfolio diet metabolic study and is often cited as evidence that specific diet combinations can lower LDL ~30% without statins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Heart UK also noted that even in “free-living” conditions (outside labs), LDL reductions are meaningful, around 17%–20%, depending on adherence. In other words, this major heart-health charity explicitly states that under metabolic study conditions, reductions of up to ~35% are possible with diet alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Another &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33762150/" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;major review on cholesterol-lowering foods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found solid evidence that soluble fiber-rich foods (like oats, barley, psyllium), plant sterols/stanols and &lt;keyword id="40735" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="healthy" source="Orion"&gt;healthy&lt;/keyword&gt; unsaturated fats (e.g., from nuts and olive oil), each contribute to moderate reductions in LDL cholesterol. Increasing your intake of soluble fiber is one of the best-studied ways to lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol without medication. Soluble fiber binds to cholesterol in the digestive system and helps remove it before it enters the bloodstream. A British Journal of Nutrition meta-analysis found that beta-glucan (the soluble fiber in oats) causes consistent reductions in LDL when consumed regularly. Health authorities like the US Food and Drug Administration and Healthline’s LDL guidelines recommend soluble-fiber-rich foods such as oats, legumes, fruits and vegetables to help reduce LDL levels. Soluble fiber is not just a trend, it is a dietary corner-stone in heart disease prevention and is recommended by heart health authorities around the world. Choose healthy fats and plant sterols to improve your lipid profile. Not all fats are equal. Replacing saturated and trans fats with unsaturated, plant-focused fats can improve cholesterol levels. The American Heart Association (AHA) advises reducing saturated fat intake (e.g., butter, processed meats) and replacing it with healthier fats from olive oil, nuts and avocados. Harvard Health Publishing notes that eating nuts (like almonds and walnuts), about 2 ounces a day, can help slightly lower LDL Plant sterols and stanols (found naturally in vegetables, nuts and fortified foods) can reduce LDL absorption in the gut. About 2g a day may lower LDL by up to ~10 %.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle Overhaul With Diet and Exercise Works, Sometimes Dramatically - &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Researchers in a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/615295" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine (Arch Intern Med) study&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; noted, “Most adults can significantly reduce serum lipid values and the risk for atherosclerosis… through lifestyle modification consisting of diet and exercise.” In this large study of more than 4,500 adults, a 3-week program that combined a high-fiber, high-complex-carbohydrate, low-fat diet with daily aerobic exercise produced a 23% drop in total cholesterol and LDL. That is comparable to what many medications achieve, just with food and movement. Move more as even moderate activity improves cholesterol. Physical activity does not have to mean gym marathons. Regular movement itself supports better cholesterol numbers. The Mayo Clinic and AHA recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity per week, which can help raise HDL (“good”) and lower LDL cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise, Weight and Smoking &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cessation Are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Than Just Good Habits - &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21291669/" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;review in Clinics in Chest Medicine (review on HDL)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found, “Regular physical activity, attaining a healthy weight, and cessation of cigarette smoking are associated with beneficial HDL cholesterol changes.” This systematic review pulls together evidence showing that exercise can increase protective HDL (“good”) cholesterol, weight loss enhances favourable lipid changes and smoking cessation improves both HDL and overall heart risk. Together, these lifestyle changes do not just shift numbers, they influence whole-system cardiovascular risk. Lose extra weight and manage body composition. Even small changes in body weight can make meaningful differences in cholesterol. The Mayo Clinic notes that weight loss, even just 5–10 lbs, is linked to lower LDL and total cholesterol. Maintaining a healthy weight improves HDL and lowers LDL. Quit smoking and limit alcohol. Two everyday habits that influence cholesterol are smoking and alcohol use. Quitting smoking is linked with improved HDL levels and lower heart disease risk, with benefits appearing quickly after cessation. Alcohol can raise triglycerides and potentially worsen lipid profiles when consumed in excess. Even beyond cholesterol, quitting smoking and moderating alcohol helps overall cardiovascular health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress, Sleep and Cholesterol Have a Hidden Connection - &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Not all lifestyle factors are dietary or physical. Your body’s stress levels and sleep patterns influence metabolism and appetite, both of which affect cholesterol. Evidence from clinical guidance reveals that stress can trigger hormonal changes that alter fat metabolism. Good sleep helps regulate hunger hormones, reducing cravings for high-fat foods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Actionable swaps to boost heart health without statins, as per studies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start your day with oatmeal or oat bran.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add beans, lentils, apples and pears to meals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sprinkle ground flaxseed on yogurt or salads.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use olive, canola or sunflower oil instead of butter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Snack on a small handful of nuts daily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add avocado and other plant sterol-rich produce to salads.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go for brisk walking, cycling or swimming.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exercise for 30 minutes, most days of the week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strength train for additional metabolic benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Track what you eat using a journal or app.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combine regular movement with mindful eating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce sugary beverages and excess refined carbs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aim for 7–9 hours of quality sleep per night.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce stress with mindfulness, yoga or breathing exercises.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prioritise routines that support regular circadian rhythms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These swaps work in addition to, not instead of, an overall balanced diet. Sustained movement helps the body remove LDL while boosting protective HDL, improving cardiovascular risk across the board. While less direct than diet and exercise, managing stress and sleep amplifies other cholesterol-lowering efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bottom line&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/TLC-Therapeutic-Lifestyle-Changes-Lower-Cholesterol" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of the US National Institutes of Health, has long recommended the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; as an evidence-based strategy to help lower LDL cholesterol and suggest, “Increase soluble fiber… add plant stanols and sterols… and reduce saturated fat and cholesterol to lower LDL.” This official guidance reflects decades of clinical evidence, including the studies above, supporting lifestyle approaches that complement or sometimes reduce the need for medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soluble fiber and plant sterols bind cholesterol in the gut and reduce absorption into the bloodstream. Healthy fats and nuts help replace saturated fats and support better lipid profiles. Exercise and weight loss help the body shuttle cholesterol more effectively and improve heart health. Smoking cessation reduces harmful processes that heighten cardiovascular risk and lowers bad fats indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major peer-reviewed journals and national health guidelines agree that you can make meaningful changes to your cholesterol profile through lifestyle, sometimes comparable to medical therapy, especially when done consistently.

This suggests that when the body is immediately exposed to cold after being in a warm place, it can stress the cardiovascular system. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The cardiologist also alerted that the morning hours tend to have higher pollution levels and lower oxygen density, which can place additional stress on the heart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Waning signs you should know&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/14/550x309/chest_pain_1763147301311_1763147305890.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Chest pain is one of the warning signs.

(Adobe Stock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The cardiologist highlighted that while the risks are not uniform and healthy individuals generally adapt well, people with existing cardiovascular conditions may find it harder to adjust.&lt;/span&gt; He added that certain warning signs indicate the need to stop exercising immediately:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest discomfort&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unusual breathlessness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dizziness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Palpitations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How to keep morning walks safe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;So, while the cold itself is not inherently dangerous, factors such as higher pollution levels and reduced oxygen density can make winter mornings very risky, particularly for people with pre-existing health issues, to go for a walk.&lt;/span&gt; But this does not mean you should give up morning walks. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Ghose recommended this safer method for enjoying morning walks: “To safely enjoy winter morning walks, consider a gradual warm-up indoors before heading outside, dress in layers to maintain body heat, and avoid very early outings when temperatures are at their lowest.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have the option to adjust your walking time, it is better to do so. The cardiologist suggested that mid-morning walks are far safer, as they provide a balance between fresh air and milder temperatures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

		&lt;figcaption&gt;I felt relief – as well as confusion (Picture: Steve Ullathorne)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Have you tried being less stressed?’ the doctor suggested. I did my best to hide my frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the better part of four weeks, I’d been dealing with a&lt;a data-ico="hyperlink-article" href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/05/10/woman-allergic-to-her-unborn-baby-had-huge-rash-across-her-body-6627017/" data-type="link" data-id="https://metro.co.uk/2017/05/10/woman-allergic-to-her-unborn-baby-had-huge-rash-across-her-body-6627017/"&gt; full-body rash&lt;/a&gt;, which had suddenly become red and increasingly sore. Then one morning in May 2024, taking a shower felt like acid &lt;a data-ico="hyperlink-article" href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rain/" data-track="inline-tag-auto-link_article"&gt;rain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon my GP’s advice, my boyfriend, Adam, and I went to A&amp;amp;E, and this was the response I received. I felt like I wasn’t being heard, my experience invalidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Adam spoke up. ‘She’s in a lot of pain and needs help,’ he said calmly and clearly. ‘The advice so far hasn’t improved things and it’s getting worse.’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctor listened and prescribed a &lt;a data-ico="hyperlink-article" href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/12/26/didnt-realise-giving-builder-painkillers-land-jail-2-22222739/" data-type="link" data-id="https://metro.co.uk/2024/12/26/didnt-realise-giving-builder-painkillers-land-jail-2-22222739/"&gt;strong painkiller&lt;/a&gt;. I felt relief – as well as confusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My medical history is complex (at best) and I have grown up feeling dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I developed symptoms of &lt;a data-ico="hyperlink-article" href="https://metro.co.uk/2023/03/13/i-was-diagnosed-with-ocd-at-9-by-13-i-couldnt-leave-the-house-18408169/" data-type="link" data-id="https://metro.co.uk/2023/03/13/i-was-diagnosed-with-ocd-at-9-by-13-i-couldnt-leave-the-house-18408169/"&gt;obsessive-compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt; (OCD), anxiety and depression around the age of nine, all of which were disregarded as a ‘phase’. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last 30 years I’ve experienced a number of mental health conditions – bulimia, anorexia, binge eating disorder and depression – as well as ongoing physical concerns, and I have frequently been told that my mental health is the &lt;a data-ico="hyperlink-article" href="https://metro.co.uk/2021/11/06/the-physical-symptoms-you-might-not-realise-can-be-caused-by-stress-15551386/" data-type="link" data-id="https://metro.co.uk/2021/11/06/the-physical-symptoms-you-might-not-realise-can-be-caused-by-stress-15551386/"&gt;cause of my physical symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until anorexia took hold when I was 14 that medical professionals took things seriously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had multiple life-saving hospitalisations but&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;was subsequently given many new diagnoses, including&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder and &lt;a data-ico="hyperlink-article" href="https://metro.co.uk/2020/05/14/constant-zoom-calls-are-worsening-peoples-body-dysmorphia-12697948/" data-type="link" data-id="https://metro.co.uk/2020/05/14/constant-zoom-calls-are-worsening-peoples-body-dysmorphia-12697948/"&gt;body dysmorphic disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="img-container shareable-item wp-caption"&gt;
	
		&lt;figcaption&gt;I felt as though I was viewed as an attention seeker – in reality, I was crying out for help (Picture: Juliette Burton)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, these interventions came too late. I developed further complications, including psychosis and hallucinations, paranoia and agoraphobia, with complex PTSD (cPTSD) suggested eventually in my 30s as being at the root of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt as though I was viewed as an attention seeker – in reality, I was crying out for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I entered my thirties, physical issues including musculoskeletal pain and digestive problems came to the fore. Again, doctors dismissed these as psychological in origin, as though my pain was an extension of my depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="img-container shareable-item wp-caption"&gt;
	
		&lt;figcaption&gt;I internalised that misogyny not to ‘be a burden’ and to stop ‘making a fuss over nothing’ (Picture: Juliette Burton)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, I stopped trusting my own body and started believing their dismissals. I went along with whatever was said because I didn’t have the energy to keep fighting. And I internalised that misogyny not to ‘be a burden’ and to stop ‘making a fuss over nothing’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;stopped visiting my GP, which, unsurprisingly, impacted my health further, and any treatment I did receive seemed to be massively&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;delayed&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;At times, I felt utterly lost, alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until that A&amp;amp;E experience in 2024 that I finally wondered: Why had it taken Adam’s advocacy for doctors to respond? Why had they responded far faster to his voice than mine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="img-container shareable-item wp-caption"&gt;
	
		&lt;figcaption&gt;Meanwhile, women are still suffering (Picture: Juliette Burton)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I realised: It was the clearest case I’d ever experienced &lt;a data-ico="hyperlink-article" href="https://metro.co.uk/video/vanessa-feltz-blames-medical-misogyny-mothers-death-2991967/" data-type="link" data-id="https://metro.co.uk/video/vanessa-feltz-blames-medical-misogyny-mothers-death-2991967/"&gt;of medical misogyny.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I’m not the only woman to experience it. According to one study, the UK has the highest gender health gap out of all the G20 countries and medical misogyny contributes&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to misdiagnoses, inadequate pain management and delayed treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same research found that 60% of women in the UK believe their &lt;a data-ico="hyperlink-article" href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/03/22/sarah-hyland-lets-rip-doctors-not-taking-chronic-illness-seriously-7407723/" data-type="link" data-id="https://metro.co.uk/2018/03/22/sarah-hyland-lets-rip-doctors-not-taking-chronic-illness-seriously-7407723/"&gt;health issues are not taken seriously&lt;/a&gt;, and 57% of women have had a negative experience with a healthcare professional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those figures are devastating yet there is little being done to eradicate them. Meanwhile, women are still suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="img-container shareable-item wp-caption"&gt;
	
		&lt;figcaption&gt;The rash covered every inch of my body from neck to toe (Picture: Juliette Burton)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had Adam not driven me to A&amp;amp;E, convinced me to endure the six-hour-long wait to be seen then spoken to the doctor himself, I suspect I would have been cast aside &lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that week, when we collected &lt;a data-ico="hyperlink-article" href="https://metro.co.uk/2023/01/21/excruciating-rashes-from-steroid-cream-withdrawal-left-mum-suicidal-18142200/" data-type="link" data-id="https://metro.co.uk/2023/01/21/excruciating-rashes-from-steroid-cream-withdrawal-left-mum-suicidal-18142200/"&gt;steroid cream&lt;/a&gt; prescribed for my rash, it was only thanks to Adam&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;pushing back against the pharmacy staff&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that I received the correct amount instead of a bottle no bigger than the size of a travel toothpaste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve no idea why I was initially issued such a small tube, I think it might have been the correct dosage that had been prescribed but too small a dosage to cover my entire body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rash covered every inch of my body from neck to toe, but we were given a tube that would’ve dealt with a rash on the back of your hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="img-container shareable-item wp-caption"&gt;
	
		&lt;figcaption&gt;No woman should have to feel like they need to bring a man to an appointment just to get the doctor’s attention (Picture: Juliette Burton)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s infuriating and unjust that a man’s voice seems to still command more authority than a woman’s in this day and age. Whether I’m getting my car fixed or calling for a plumber, people often defer to my male partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of dismissal in healthcare is especially dangerous. It jeopardises women’s wellbeing. I wonder how many of my medical problems could’ve been prevented had I not had my complaints ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No woman should have to feel like they need to bring a man to an appointment just to get the doctor’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical training must stamp out medical misogyny at the source and culturally, we&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;need to encourage people to stand up for themselves when they aren’t getting the care they need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to get better at that. I’ve spent enough of my life waiting to be heard, but no more.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;I’m starting by calling myself and my internalised misogyny out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every single person, of any gender, should be listened to when it comes to their health. We will not stand for being dismissed anymore.  &lt;/p&gt;

However, when she looked down at her feet, she saw that the white sandy beach was covered with &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/plastic"&gt;plastic&lt;/a&gt; debris, most of which was from plastic bottles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;After many years in the business world as the cofounder of an environmental software company, the experience inspired Sajedi to become a researcher. She had always had a passion for waste reduction, but she realized that the problem was consumption itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Thus, as a doctoral student at Concordia University in Canada, Sajedi &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2025.138948" target="_blank"&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; over 140 &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2025.138948" target="_blank"&gt;scientific papers&lt;/a&gt; to determine the effects of plastic bottles on the human body. She found that people ingest an average of 39,000 to 52,000 &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-microplastic-crisis-is-getting-exponentially-worse/"&gt;microplastic particles&lt;/a&gt; per year from food and drinking water, and those who use bottled water on a daily basis ingest nearly 90,000 more microplastic particles into their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Drinking water from plastic bottles is fine in an emergency, but it is not something that should be used in daily life,” Sajedi &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2025/09/09/the-chronic-risks-from-single-use-plastic-water-bottles-are-dangerously-understudied-new-concordia-research-shows.html?c=/news/media-relations/releases" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2025/09/09/the-chronic-risks-from-single-use-plastic-water-bottles-are-dangerously-understudied-new-concordia-research-shows.html?c=/news/media-relations/releases"}' href="https://www.concordia.ca/news/stories/2025/09/09/the-chronic-risks-from-single-use-plastic-water-bottles-are-dangerously-understudied-new-concordia-research-shows.html?c=/news/media-relations/releases" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;. “Even if there are no immediate effects on the human body, we need to understand the potential for chronic harm.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Long-Term Effects Remain a Mystery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Microplastics are plastic particles ranging in size from 1 micrometer (1/1,000 of a millimeter) to 5 mm. Nanoplastics are even smaller, less than one micrometer. These particles are invisible to the naked eye, but are constantly being generated during the manufacturing, storage, transportation, and decomposition of bottles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Low-quality plastics, in particular, are prone to release microscopic debris due to sunlight, temperature changes, and physical manipulation. Unlike other plastic particles that enter the body through the food chain, those derived from plastic bottles are of concern because they are ingested directly with drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Once in the body, microscopic plastics can enter the bloodstream and reach vital organs. This triggers a chronic inflammatory response and exposes cells to oxidative stress, which can lead to hormone system disturbances, impaired reproductive function, and damage to the nervous system. It has also been linked to various types of cancer. On the other hand, the long-term effects on health remain unclear, due to the lack of extensive testing and standardized measurement methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Several analytical methods exist for detecting micro- and nanoplastics, but each has its own advantages and weaknesses. Some methods can detect extremely small particles but cannot determine their chemical composition, while others can analyze composition but miss the smallest particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQVWpyd0FzTmhwRVRWZklfMjdWZExaNGJtM3d0eld4clpBcmZKRy13YkdmQTRLODUtQlVJcHZqb1luWE1UZUJ0eW9FdExOWVF5dVRVbHYzZUdQRUZZUWNNajNpVlpaS1R5ang2MENnM1k4R2JDcEhUWVlJSkNlak40LUpHNUlEMUlTVWdSTWZVenh5TGZ0Z0NSOFYtcWJwQXBKRTlwVEtzMWxMMWIxUVJIdlhOaVN3bW1M</guid></item><item><title>人体有多少个洞？ - Live Science</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/mathematics/how-many-holes-does-the-human-body-have</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto paywall-locker"&gt;

&lt;p id="f8106e8b-534d-4126-a62c-6e4a5c8efaea"&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/37009-human-body.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/37009-human-body.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;human body&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is extraordinarily complex, with several openings and a few exits. But exactly how many holes does each person have?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like a simple enough question to answer — list the openings and add them up. But it's not quite that easy once you start considering questions like: "What exactly is a hole?" "Does any opening count?" And "why don't mathematicians know the difference between a straw and a doughnut?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="f8106e8b-534d-4126-a62c-6e4a5c8efaea-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Before we start counting, we need to agree on what constitutes a "hole." &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.katiesteckles.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.katiesteckles.co.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Katie Steckles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a lecturer in mathematics at Manchester Metropolitan University in the U.K. and a freelance mathematics communicator, told Live Science that mathematicians "use the term 'hole' to mean one like the hole in a donut: one that goes all the way through a shape and out the other side."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1c8f1268-9769-48d8-b34b-ac0991cba467"&gt;But if you dig a "hole" at the beach, your aim is probably not to dig right through to the other side of the world. Many people would think of a hole as a depression in a solid object. But "this isn't a true hole, as it has an end," Steckles said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, mathematical communicator &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamesa.xyz/" target="_blank" data-url="https://jamesa.xyz/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;James Arthur&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who is based in the U.K., told Live Science that "in topology, a 'hole' is a through hole, that is you can put your finger through the object."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When digging a tunnel under the sea, like the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/technology/engineering/could-we-ever-build-a-transatlantic-tunnel" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/technology/engineering/could-we-ever-build-a-transatlantic-tunnel"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Channel Tunnel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that connects the U.K. and France, engineers started off by digging two openings. But as soon as those two digging projects joined up, the Channel Tunnel became a fundamentally different object (what Arthur and engineers would call a "through hole") — like a straw, or a tube with an opening at either end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/08/11/50da6/3" target="_blank" data-url="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/08/11/50da6/3" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt; &lt;u&gt;if you ask people how many holes a straw has&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; you will get a range of different answers:&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Kit_Yates_Maths/status/1558015146844471296?s=20&amp;amp;t=3YZgsRL02devfyqoRNbsxA" target="_blank" data-url="https://x.com/Kit_Yates_Maths/status/1558015146844471296?s=20&amp;amp;t=3YZgsRL02devfyqoRNbsxA" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt; &lt;u&gt;one, two and even zero&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This is a result of our colloquial understanding of what constitutes a hole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find a consistent answer, we can turn to&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/mathematics" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/physics-mathematics/mathematics"&gt; &lt;u&gt;mathematics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And the problem of classifying how many holes there are in an object falls squarely within the realm of topology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="a9edf537-ed45-4711-b3c8-ca4279d414c6"&gt;To a topologist, the actual shapes of objects are not important. Instead, "topology is more concerned with the fundamental properties of shapes and how things connect together in space," Steckles said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In topology, objects can be grouped together by the number of holes they possess. For example, a topologist sees no difference between a golf ball, a baseball or even a Frisbee. If they were all made of plasticine, or putty, they could theoretically be squashed, stretched or otherwise manipulated to look like each other without making or closing any holes in the plasticine or sticking different parts together, Steckles argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, to a topologist, these objects are fundamentally different to a bagel, a doughnut or a basketball hoop, which each have a hole through the middle of them. A figure of eight with two holes and a pretzel with three are different topological objects again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="d3d0d883-d899-40e5-98b6-5ab6f0fc43bf"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;This delicious pretzel has three holes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="789b8ce9-3c8a-4915-8151-b925d409909a"&gt;A useful way to get into the mathematicians' way of thinking about the straw problem is to "imagine our straw is made of play dough," Arthur said. "Let's take this straw and slowly squish the top down and down and down towards the bottom, making sure the hole in the middle stays open. We will squish it until we are in a shape that looks like a doughnut." Mathematicians, Arthur said, would say that "the straw is homeomorphic to a doughnut."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long, thin aspect ratio of the straw, and the fact that the two openings are relatively far apart, are perhaps what gives rise to the suggestion of two holes. But to a topologist, bagels, basketball hoops and doughnuts are all topologically equivalent to a straw with a single hole. "The hole in a straw goes all the way through it, and the opening at the other end is just the back of that same hole," Steckles said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-b5cc1ea5-00ed-4969-8f77-0396988e0e5b" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="back-to-the-human-body-3"&gt;Back to the human body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="70468600-b6e4-48ce-ad0c-77057eae822c"&gt;Armed with the topologists' definition of a hole, we can tackle the original question: How many holes does the human body have? Let's first try to list all the openings we have. The obvious ones are probably our mouths, our urethras (the ones we pee out of) and our &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/why-does-pooping-feel-so-good" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/why-does-pooping-feel-so-good"&gt;&lt;u&gt;anuses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the openings in our &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/breathing-nose-sides" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/breathing-nose-sides"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nostrils&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/52287-ear-anatomy.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/52287-ear-anatomy.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ears&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For some of us, there are also milk ducts in nipples and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/36516-facts-women-vagina-health-myths.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/36516-facts-women-vagina-health-myths.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;vaginas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also four less-obvious openings that we all have in the corners of eyelids closest to our nose — the four&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/lacrimal-punctum" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/lacrimal-punctum" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt; &lt;u&gt;lacrimal puncta&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which drain tears from our eyes into our nasal cavities. At an even smaller scale there are the pores that enable sweat to escape our bodies and sebum to lubricate our skin. In total there are potentially millions of these openings in our bodies, but do they all count as holes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="94f6e41f-09b8-4a8c-9a83-b5cdf8ff698a"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;The two lacrimal puncta drain tears from the eye down the lacrimal canals and through to the nasolacrimal duct which connects to the nasal cavity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="464a9889-ccde-4bd2-8ae0-ca9957dc99c2"&gt;To make the question interesting, think about whether we could pass a very thin string into one hole and out of another. If we set the size of this string to be about 60 microns (60 millionths of a meter) then it's possible that the string could enter an opening as small as a pore. However — and this is key — it wouldn't be able to leave. It wouldn't be able to come out the other end. It would be blocked by the cells at the bottom of the pore — too thick to pass through into the vasculature that supplies the pore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're not actually holes in the topological sense, as they don't go all the way through," Steckles said. "They're just blind pits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By this definition we can rule out all the pores, milk ducts and urethras. We couldn't thread a string in one of these openings and out of another. Even the ears canals have to go as they are separated from the rest of the sinuses by the ear drums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have our mouth, our anus, and then our nostrils. They are four of the … openings that form a hole," Arthur said. "But we actually have eight. The remaining four come from the tear ducts, we each have two in each eye, an upper and a lower."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this doesn't mean eight holes. Steckles pointed out ."When the holes that pass through a shape connect together inside the shape, it makes it harder to count how many there are."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-8184ab61-6fb6-4b74-be84-22f7c8a186b3" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="looking-at-underwear-3"&gt;Looking at underwear&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="3c5b7774-e8ba-4718-80d2-101a830baf8b"&gt;A pair of underwear, for example, has three openings (one for the waist and one for each of the two legs), but it's not immediately clear how many holes a topologist would say it has. "A useful trick is to think about flattening it out," Steckles said. — "If we were to stretch the waistband of the pants out onto a big hula hoop, we'd see the two trouser legs sticking down, each being one hole."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="f1136cf4-b448-4f24-b651-1dbc98269fc6"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Underwear has three openings but only two holes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="faf4a078-5ca6-43e5-9623-6accbb316cb9"&gt;So despite having three openings, the pair of underwear has only two holes. "So when the holes connect together in the middle, there's one fewer hole than there are openings," Steckles argued. Correspondingly, topology tells us that, despite eight interconnected openings, the human body has seven different holes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there might be one more. Although often counted as a blind hole, the vagina leads to the uterus, which then leads to one of two fallopian tubes. These tubes are open at the far end and lead to the peritoneal cavity near the ovary. It is the job of the finger-like projections of the funnel-shaped infundibulum at the end of the fallopian tube to catch the egg when it is released from the nearest ovary. However, it has been demonstrated that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23381619/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23381619/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eggs released from one ovary can be captured by the fallopian tube on the other side&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so that passage between the two open ends of the fallopian tubes is possible. Our tiny string could therefore be threaded all the way through the female reproductive tract and back out, counting as one more hole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="903b39fd-1a7e-4ee3-b261-d8a0c23dd5bb"&gt;So the mathematician's answer is that humans have either seven or eight holes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, the question is not just about counting openings but about understanding connections. Topologically speaking, our bodies are less like Swiss cheese and more like a carefully constructed onesie for an octopus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr id="07bb39e1-c0e3-4a5a-a785-58954b45f4fd"&gt;&lt;a id="elk-0f35b3b4-f37c-4228-9b8f-c0e9c9678dd4" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="human-skeleton-quiz-what-do-you-know-about-the-bones-in-your-body-3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/anatomy/human-skeleton-quiz-what-do-you-know-about-the-bones-in-your-body" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/anatomy/human-skeleton-quiz-what-do-you-know-about-the-bones-in-your-body"&gt;Human skeleton quiz&lt;/a&gt;: What do you know about the bones in your body?&lt;/h2&gt;

Yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most classic sign of liver distress is a yellow tint, known as Jaundice. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Mallikarjun Sakpal, consultant, HPB and transplant physician, Aster CMI Hospital, Bengaluru, explained that this occurs when the liver fails to process bilirubin — a waste product from red blood cell breakdown.&lt;/span&gt; “When the liver struggles, bilirubin levels rise, causing a &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/doctor-gastroenterologist-shares-7-early-signs-of-liver-cirrhosis-know-5-tips-to-prevent-liver-damage-101747305290844.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="mild yellowing"&gt;mild yellowing&lt;/a&gt; of the whites of the eyes or facial skin that should never be ignored,” he told HT Lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Facial puffiness and under-eye swelling&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you wake up with a consistently bloated look around your cheeks and eyes, it may not just be a lack of sleep. Dr Sudeep Khanna, senior consultant, gastroenterology, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, pointed to fluid retention as the culprit. “When the liver is overloaded with fat, it produces less of the proteins needed to keep fluids inside blood vessels. This leads to leakage into facial tissues, causing&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/suffering-from-swollen-puffy-eyes-dermatologist-shares-why-this-may-happen-and-how-to-reduce-puffiness-101756377953013.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="persistent puffiness,"&gt; persistent puffiness,&lt;/a&gt;” he explained in an interview to HT Lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Adult acne and oily breakouts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sudden breakouts, particularly around the jawline, cheeks, and forehead, can be a sign of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). According to Dr Sakpal, a fatty liver cannot remove toxins or balance hormones like androgens efficiently. This imbalance triggers overactive oil glands and stubborn pimples that resist standard topical treatments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Red 'spider' veins and rosacea-like flushing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny red lines branching out like a spider’s web — known as spider angiomas — are frequent markers of severe liver scarring or cirrhosis. Dr Raut explained these are caused by dilated capillaries. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Khanna added that 'rosacea-like flushing' often arises from poor estrogen breakdown, which increases blood flow to the facial skin and triggers visible vascular networks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Dullness, itching, and patchy skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liver disease can rob the skin of its natural glow. Dr Sakpal shared that a fatty liver often reduces the absorption of vitamins A and E, leading to dry, flaky, and itchy skin. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Furthermore, Dr Raut added that patients may experience a 'grey-brown' darkening or patchy appearance on the face due to hormonal imbalances and the accumulation of bile salts in the bloodstream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A silent epidemic: can it be reversed?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these signs are alarming, the medical consensus is hopeful. Dr Khanna shared that fatty liver is often asymptomatic in its early stages, usually only detectable via ultrasound. However, once facial signs appear, it is a clear signal to act. “Weight loss of just 5 to 10 percent can significantly shrink liver fat and even reverse disease progression,” Dr Khanna said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Recommended lifestyle swaps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;⦿ Diet: Switch to greens-rich meals and cut out sugary sodas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⦿ Activity: Incorporate at least 30 minutes of &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/walking-just-7k-steps-daily-can-reduce-risk-of-death-47-lower-cardiovascular-disease-incidence-25-lancet-study-10k-101753334398446.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="daily walking"&gt;daily walking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⦿ Supplementation: Adding anti-inflammatory spices like turmeric can aid recovery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⦿ Screening: If you have risk factors like obesity or diabetes, consult a doctor for a FibroScan or ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

But growing research suggests that the effects of weight loss may change with age. During midlife, losing weight may not always produce the same health benefits seen in younger adults and in some cases, it may also influence brain health.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a new study from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU), researchers examined how diet-induced obesity and later weight loss affected young adult mice compared with mid-aged mice. In both groups, weight loss successfully restored healthy blood glucose control, showing that key metabolic improvements occur regardless of age. However, the scientists also observed an unexpected difference. In mid-aged mice, weight loss led to increased inflammation in the hypothalamus, a part of the brain involved in regulating appetite, energy use, and other essential functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Inflammation Raises New Questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This increase in brain inflammation was detected at the molecular level and through detailed microscopic imaging of microglia (the brain's immune cells). The inflammatory response lasted for several weeks before gradually declining. While the long-term effects of this response are still unclear and may even play a role in achieving metabolic improvements, the findings raise important concerns. Persistent or poorly regulated inflammation in the brain has been linked to memory problems and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's. As a result, the study highlights new questions about how weight loss during midlife may interact with brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers Urge a More Nuanced View of Midlife Weight Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings show that losing weight in midlife is not a simple copy-and-paste of what works in young adulthood," said Alon Zemer, an M.D.-Ph.D. candidate and the first author of this paper. "Weight loss remains essential for restoring metabolic health in obesity, but we need to understand the impact of weight loss on the mid-age brain and ensure brain health is not compromised."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Alexandra Tsitrina added: "Our study characterizes the body's adaptive response to weight loss through two complementary dimensions -- molecular and structural. This high-end imaging by advanced microscopy and image analysis with advanced computational analysis enable detection of sensitive changes with potential health ramifications."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps for Protecting Brain Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team stresses the importance of additional studies to better understand why this temporary but concerning brain inflammation occurs during midlife weight loss. Future work could help scientists develop approaches that maintain the metabolic advantages of weight loss while also protecting brain health as people age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, titled, "Weight loss aggravates obesity-induced hypothalamic inflammation in mid-aged mice" was published in &lt;em&gt;GeroScience&lt;/em&gt; and supported by an internal grant at BGU (with the Ilse Katz Institute of Nanoscale Science and Technology), and grants from theUS-Israel Binational Science Foundation (Grant no. 2021083) and the Israel Science Foundation (Grant No. 194/24).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
