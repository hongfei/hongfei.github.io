This area contains a lot of blood vessels – little capillaries that keep the nostrils well supplied with blood, to warm the air you inhale. These can break open, creating a bleed that mostly pours from the nostril, though some blood may trickle into the mouth or throat, especially if you lean your head back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="38f6c6ba-dc34-4082-a870-9e78838a62af" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘Let them’, creatine and fibermaxxing: the biggest wellness trends of 2025","elementId":"38f6c6ba-dc34-4082-a870-9e78838a62af","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jul/31/creatine-fibermaxxing-biggest-wellness-trends"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Posterior nosebleeds are rarer and bigger. These are triggered when larger blood vessels deeper in the nasal passage burst. If there is significantly more blood flowing down the back of your throat, potentially causing you to choke, that’s a posterior nosebleed, explains Dr Amin Javer, an ENT surgeon and research director at the University of British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Posterior nosebleeds are more serious than anterior ones, and require prompt medical attention. They’re most often seen in older adults, especially those taking anticoagulants, which increase the risk of hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-should-you-do-when-your-nose-is-bleeding" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should you do when your nose is bleeding?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When a nosebleed starts, many people instinctively tip their head back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“That’s the worst thing you could do,” says Javer. “You’re going to just start drinking the blood.” Blood in the stomach causes nausea, so it’s best to avoid this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, you should put your head forward and very gently pinch your nose, he says. A cold compress on the neck or nose can help constrict blood vessels and slow the bleed, as can a spritz of a nasal decongestant like oxymetazoline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you see thick clots come out of your nose, it can be unsettling. But it’s not necessarily a bad sign, nor is it uncommon. “It’s actually just showing that your blood is clotting effectively,” says Dr Peter Manes, an ENT surgeon and residency director at Yale School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If your nosebleeds are occurring multiple times a week, interfering with your daily life, and/or lasting longer than &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-nosebleeds/basics/art-20056683" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;30 minutes&lt;/a&gt;, they warrant seeing a doctor for a clinical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-causes-nosebleeds" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What causes nosebleeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“One of the most common reasons for [anterior] nosebleeds is when the area dries out,” explains Loftus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dry air is especially to blame in winter. “It doesn’t matter how much rain there is outside – our heaters turn on, the humidity in our bedrooms goes down,” says Javer. He recommends cracking a window while you sleep or getting a humidifier to keep humidity levels between 40% and 50%. You can also moisturize your nasal lining with saline spray or a very thin layer of Vaseline just inside the nostrils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Another common reason for nosebleeds is “digital manipulation, which is a nice way of saying nose picking or scratching your nose”, says Loftus. The nose is delicate, and even a light bump or scratch can pop a capillary and cause bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Ginseng, garlic, ginkgo – some of those herbal medications can thin your blood&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Inflammation from &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/13/how-to-treat-manage-seasonal-allergies" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;allergies&lt;/a&gt; or viral infections can make the lining more fragile and prone to cracking. Physical exertion sometimes plays a role too. Exercises, especially those that combine effort with positions where your head dips below your heart, like downward dog pose, can increase pressure in the face and prompt a bleed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Medications and supplements add another layer of risk. Prescription blood thinners and aspirin make bleeding more likely, and some herbal supplements have similar effects. “Ginseng, garlic, ginkgo – some of those herbal medications can thin your blood,” says Manes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"index":22,"listId":6039,"identityName":"well-actually","description":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life","name":"Well Actually","frequency":"Weekly","successDescription":"You are subscribed","theme":"lifestyle","idApiUrl":"https://idapi.theguardian.com","hideNewsletterSignupComponentForSubscribers":true}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-am-i-having-frequent-nosebleeds" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why am I having frequent nosebleeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If you’re having a nosebleed every day and you don’t know what’s causing it, you need evaluation,” says Loftus. “Even if it’s not bothering you that much, that’s alarming enough to come see a doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Manes agrees that nosebleeds can become “normalized”, and easy to dismiss as minor, but they do occasionally signal more serious issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Abundant nosebleeds can indicate that your blood is not clotting correctly, Loftus says. A doctor may ask about alcohol use or other factors to discern if a liver issue is involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hormonal changes in pregnancy can play a role. Loftus says pregnancy-induced surges in hormones like estrogen and progesterone are linked to a higher likelihood of lobular capillary hemangioma, a “usually pretty small lesion in the nose” that can cause nosebleeds. These growths are not inherently dangerous, but should be evaluated by a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you’re in your 20s and suddenly having frequent, heavy nosebleeds, you could be among the roughly one in 5,000 people with “hereditary hemorrhagic telangectasia” (HHT), a genetic vascular abnormality that often presents in young adulthood and requires treatment. Without medical attention, patients with HHT may “succumb to death from nosebleed,” says Javer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ ","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"8123c371-b43f-4f74-b9b7-7faefc0f5289","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="8123c371-b43f-4f74-b9b7-7faefc0f5289" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ " data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99%C2%A0" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Frequent unilateral nosebleeds – bleeding from only one nostril – are a significant red flag for doctors. That pattern can signal a tumor or polyp, especially if accompanied by symptoms on the same side of the face, like not being able to breathe through the nose; facial pain or pressure; or unilateral ear pain, numbness or vision changes, says Loftus. “That should get checked out,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-do-doctors-treat-a-nosebleed" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do doctors treat a nosebleed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many nosebleeds can be taken care of at home. But if you have persistent, frequent or high-volume nosebleeds that disrupt your daily life, or if you think you’re having a posterior bleed, seek medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you arrive in the emergency room or a doctor’s office with an active nosebleed, there are a few things you can expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;First is “a thorough examination of your nasal cavity, trying to identify a source of the bleed,” says Manes. Most bleeds can be controlled with packing – the insertion of a nasal tampon (which is different to the menstrual product).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A doctor may cauterize the area that is bleeding, says Manes. The procedure stings, but a numbing cream can ease the pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;You may have your vitals checked and blood drawn to look for issues such as anemia or clotting abnormalities. If symptoms suggest a mass in the sinuses, a CT scan or MRI may be recommended. And if you’ve lost a significant amount of blood, you could require a transfusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 17:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTFA0N2xKdE9XSkhSS3B5RGdKMVgzVDB2MUFhLVJpREFDM2lFclBJZmdOMWtjcC02ZXotVFVEQ0JxVTJOZnBNRFVrTW9sLXRVTXNPUU9lT2NlNTRlaW5FWkY3WXRqampHbGJZREFaZEF1TzE0TllobTdDRlIwVGg</guid></item><item><title>富兰克林县的后院羊群禽流感检测呈阳性- WRAL</title><link>https://www.wral.com/news/local/avian-flu-franklin-county-january-2026/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;The state reports a case of bird flu has been discovered in Franklin County.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Department of Agriculture &amp;amp; Consumer Services said a 'backyard flock' tested positive for High Path Avian Influenza (HPAI) in a release distributed on Tuesday. The strain of virus is considered low-risk, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. The virus is considered highly contagious to other birds.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;A backyard flock generally refers to animals not intended for commercial use.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The development is the first confirmed positive case in Franklin County and the ninth confirmed positive case in North Carolina since Oct. 1, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“HPAI has been found in wild birds throughout the state so
reports of positive backyard flocks will likely happen on occasion,” said state veterinarian Dr.
Mike Martin. “I encourage our commercial and backyard flock
owners to continue to follow strict biosecurity measures and if your flock is
experiencing a sudden higher-than-normal mortality rate, report it right away
to your local veterinarian or to the NCDA&amp;amp;CS’ Veterinary Division at
919-707-3250.” &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;A list of domestic bird cases of HPAI is &lt;a href="https://www.ncagr.gov/divisions/veterinary/AvianInfluenza"&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Flu cases are continuing to spike in the United States. New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that at least 5,000 people have died of the illness this year and that doctor's visits for flu have reached their highest level in decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC estimated there have been at least 11 million flu cases &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;as of December 27&lt;/a&gt;, as well as at least 120,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths. There have been nine flu-related pediatric deaths, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, 8.2% of outpatient doctor's visits nationwide were for flu-like illnesses, the CDC said. That's the highest level recorded since 1997, &lt;a href="https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty-eight jurisdictions are showing "high" or "very high" levels of flu, the agency said. Last week, 32 jurisdictions met that description. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only four jurisdictions had low or minimal flu levels. Nevada has "insufficient data," the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;A new subtype of influenza A called H3N2 is spreading quickly and fueling this year's cases, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flu-season-2025-experts-pretty-worried/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;experts told CBS News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The CDC reported that of the 994 influenza viruses that tested positive for flu between Dec. 20 and Dec. 27, 971 of them had influenza A. When 600 of those specimens were subtyped, 91.2% of them were found to be H3N2. The strain is known to cause tough flu seasons, especially for seniors, and is harder for the immune system to recognize. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, fewer people have received the flu vaccine. The CDC estimated that about 130 million doses of the flu vaccine had been given this year. On Monday, the CDC announced updates to its &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-announces-new-childhood-vaccine-recommendations/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;recommended childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The changes included saying that children who are not high-risk should engage in "shared clinical decision-making" with their doctor about whether to get the flu vaccine. The American Academy of Pediatrics called the changes "dangerous" and said they would continue to share their own recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Making these changes amid ongoing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases shows a disregard for the real confusion families already face," said Dr. Ronald G. Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                
                
                &lt;p&gt;What if the healthiest vegetable on the planet isn't kale, spinach, or &lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/broccoli-is-america-s-favorite-vegetable-1847101896/" target="_blank"&gt;broccoli (America's favorite vegetable)&lt;/a&gt;, but something you've probably walked past in the grocery store without a second glance? It's tiny, peppery, and misused and abused as garnish — it's watercress! Most people aren't familiar with watercress — maybe because for some absurd reason grocery stores tend to stock it in obscure places or because it never got the same PR push as kale or cauliflower. Unfortunately, watercress is barely making headlines six years after it topped the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2014/13_0390.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's list of Powerhouse Fruits and Vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, with a perfect nutrient density score of 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many fruits and vegetables are known for their nutrients, the CDC used a stricter standard in the study. To qualify as a "powerhouse" food, an item had to deliver at least 10% of the daily value of 17 key nutrients per 100 calories. The nutrient amounts were pulled from USDA data measured per 100 grams of raw food, then converted into nutrients per calorie to determine the score (now that's some pretty particular criteria!). Those 17 nutrients were chosen for their public health importance: potassium, protein, calcium, iron, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin A, plus nutrients linked to chronic-disease protection, including fiber, folate, zinc, and vitamins B6, B12, C, D, E, and K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although watercress may not have the vitamin A of sweet potatoes, the potassium of beet greens, or the protein of Brussels sprouts, what makes it special is that it still delivers at least 10% of every qualifying nutrient — all while staying vastly below 100 calories.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Watercress is also one of the richest sources of phytochemicals — natural compounds found in plant foods that not only give them their color, but also help protect the body from inflammation and cell damage linked to chronic illnesses, especially cancer. When watercress is cut or chewed, it releases compounds called isothiocyanates, which help neutralize carcinogens and stop tumors from spreading. Studies show the isothiocyanates in watercress may help prevent colon cancer as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some phytochemicals within watercress contain a high amount of antioxidants called carotenoids, which protect cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of a heart attack and stroke. Watercress also contains dietary nitrates — plant compounds known to improve blood flow, support healthy blood vessels, reduce blood pressure, and may even enhance athletic performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the list of benefits goes on. Next time you're at the grocery store, add watercress to your cart — and if you can't find it, ask a grocer where it's hiding. Watercress is most nutrient-dense when it's raw since many of its vitamins are heat-sensitive, so you'll want to add it as a peppery bite to salads, replace &lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/1880682/salad-green-iceberg-lettuce-lack-nutrients/" target="_blank"&gt;the classic greens that are lacking in the nutrient department&lt;/a&gt; on cold sandwiches, top on eggs and roasted meats, or blend into pesto, green goddess dressing, or even &lt;a href="https://www.thetakeout.com/1897648/easy-green-sauce-pasta-blender/" target="_blank"&gt;a quick green pasta sauce&lt;/a&gt;. Your body — and your taste buds — will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    
&lt;/article&gt;

But the past 12 months have been different. Nearly 2,100 people across 44 states were impacted by measles in 2025, according to data shared by the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC).

Here, infectious disease doctors break down some of the most pressing questions people have about measles, plus what to do if you are exposed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-is-measles-so-contagious" data-node-id="8" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="8.0"&gt;Why is measles so contagious?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;While there are outbreaks across the country each year, most people aren’t overly familiar with measles. Also known as rubeola, measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="CDC" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. It may cause symptoms like a cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, high fever, and spots inside the mouth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But measles may also cause serious health complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation in the brain), per the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Measles is considered one of the most contagious diseases in the world, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-node-id="11.1" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="World Health Organization" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO). The virus can stay active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces for up to two hours. The WHO also notes that one person who is infected with measles may infect up to 18 other people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The virus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes, Dr. Russo explains. From there, people breathe in infectious particles or touch surfaces that those particles land on and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth, which may lead to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The infectious period with measles is long—people who are infected may spread the virus to others four days before they develop the classic measles rash and four days after it appears, per the WHO. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="the-vaccine-is-very-effective-at-preventing-measles" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-1udqo6z emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="14.0"&gt;How can I prevent getting measles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;There is a vaccine to prevent measles, called the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. It’s part of the childhood vaccination series and is given in two doses. One dose is 93% effective at preventing measles, while two doses is 97% effective, per the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="CDC" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.

It’s still possible to get the MMR vaccine as an adult or beyond that age range, but the doses need to be spread out by 28 days, per the AAP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The MMR vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine, which means that it contains a weakened form of the measles virus, explains &lt;a href="http://medicine.buffalo.edu/content/medicine/faculty/profile.html?ubit=jsellick" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://medicine.buffalo.edu/content/medicine/faculty/profile.html?ubit=jsellick" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Sellick, D.O." data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;John Sellick, D.O.&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease expert and professor of medicine at the State University of New York at Buffalo.

If you were born before 1957, doctors consider you to have “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="presumptive immunity" data-node-id="22.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;presumptive immunity&lt;/a&gt;,” which means that you were likely exposed to the virus as a child and therefore should have immunity to it, Dr. Russo says. “If you have presumptive immunity or if you’ve been vaccinated, you don’t have to worry about a measles exposure,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/3528/amesh-adalja" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/3528/amesh-adalja" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amesh A.

Adalja, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, agrees. “There is no action to take,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you were born after 1957 and you haven’t been vaccinated or are partially vaccinated, you still have options. While there is no treatment for measles, you can get vaccinated after an exposure or receive an injection of antibodies called immune serum globulin to help provide protection against severe disease, Dr. Adalja says. (The immune serum globulin treatment is the only option for pregnant women, infants, and people who are immunocompromised because the vaccine is a live virus and not recommended for those groups, Dr. Russo explains.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But if you know you’ve been exposed and you’re not sure if you have immunity, “the safest thing is to get vaccinated,” Dr. Russo says. Dr. Sellick agrees. “It’s safe to get another dose, even if you were fully vaccinated or already immune to the virus,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-to-do-if-you-get-measles" data-node-id="26" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;What to do if you get measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you develop symptoms of measles, call your doctor (don’t go into the office—you’ll risk exposing others). Again, there is no treatment for measles, but your doctor may suggest immune serum globulin and supportive care, like acetaminophen for fever and plenty of fluids, along with monitoring yourself for serious complications of the virus. Ultimately, it’s best to contact a healthcare provider. They can provide the next steps from there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:34:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOUDRpUzVWMV9rTlBHU0d0LWxWeU1kMHJhTnZDX0E4aGtON0xmVWYydEJoTEt5YXJ0SjdaUU9ZN1N0TzI1RUpmbTA5Tk1pZmZTa1Q5RGVfQ0ZHZ1N4TTZnR1FTWmdURkt5NF90bzdpNXZ1Z00yZUsxUVI4SWpyaExwUGh6eEFXM3BqVjlTQm9qbWlWTDJsUEhBbV90OFVpQzNub2c</guid></item><item><title>如果您因为走上楼梯而被缠住，这意味着什么- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/winded-walking-up-stairs-normal-health_l_695bd707e4b0c1bd90c46bc7</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ascended a flight or two of stairs, you likely know the feeling of being out of breath once you reach the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a common occurrence among folks of all ages and fitness abilities.

Here’s what to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be perfectly normal — going up stairs is harder on your body than walking on a flat surface.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling out of breath after walking up a flight of stairs is “what we call a normal physiological response,” said &lt;a href="https://uoflhealth.org/provider/katherine-pohlgeers/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Katherine Pohlgeers" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695bd707e4b0c1bd90c46bc7" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://uoflhealth.org/provider/katherine-pohlgeers/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;Dr. Katherine Pohlgeers&lt;/a&gt;, a family medicine and sports medicine doctor at University of Louisville Health. “Because you’ve got this increased demand on your body, you’ve got increased work — you’ve got increased oxygen demand and ventilatory requirements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re winded for a minute or so but can easily catch your breath, it’s no cause for concern, said &lt;a href="https://sportsmedicine.mayoclinic.org/expert/karl-erickson/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Karl Erickson" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695bd707e4b0c1bd90c46bc7" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://sportsmedicine.mayoclinic.org/expert/karl-erickson/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Karl Erickson&lt;/a&gt;, a performance specialist at Mayo Clinic Sports Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s quite normal ... you’re essentially lifting your body. You’re doing a squat or a lunge when you go up the stairs,” said Erickson, “so, definitely more effortful than just walking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just how winded you are will vary; you’ll be more out of breath if you run up the stairs or walk up with a heavy suitcase than if you leisurely walked up the stairs. Some folks may not even notice the breathlessness as much as others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’ve got an elite athlete ― like, I doubt Caitlin Clark gets winded going up a flight of stairs ― but for the average middle-aged person, and, unfortunately, especially here in the United States, we tend to live a little bit more sedentary lifestyle, so it can be very normal to get winded just going up one flight of stairs,” Pohlgeers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If it’s a new change or you’re noticing prolonged breathlessness, you should let your doctor know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it can be perfectly normal to feel winded after climbing the stairs, there are a few red flags that may signal a concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is your breathlessness a new issue that’s never happened before? Or is it getting worse? If the answer to either of those questions is yes, you should talk to a doctor about potential underlying issues, according to Pohlgeers. “The biggest thing is for people not to necessarily think, ‘Oh, my gosh, I’m dying,’ but also, don’t always just simply dismiss it as, ‘Well, I’m out of shape.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those are things that we really take seriously,” Pohlgeers added. “If there is a change in the exercise capacity, just making sure that we as doctors are able to do our due diligence and rule out any underlying conditions, so that we can maximize people’s lifestyles and help them be as healthy as they possibly can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underlying conditions such as heart failure, obesity, chronic lung disease, being a smoker, COPD and even being &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/iron-deficiency-anemia-fatigue-brain-fog_l_68b1a883e4b07a70c7bc5b14" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="anemic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695bd707e4b0c1bd90c46bc7" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="68b1a883e4b07a70c7bc5b14" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;anemic&lt;/a&gt; can all make the breathlessness you feel after &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/walking" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="walking" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695bd707e4b0c1bd90c46bc7" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/walking" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; up stairs worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How long it takes you to recover is always a good indicator, too,” Erickson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s normal for your breathing to be faster for a minute or two after walking up a bunch of stairs, Erickson explained. “But if it’s staying elevated past three minutes or a prolonged period of time, that’s when it becomes more concerning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice chest pain, headache or vision changes along with the breathlessness, that’s worrisome and worth chatting with your doctor about too, Pohlgeers added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;"If you get up three or four flights of stairs as an average person carrying groceries, you're good. That's a very good sign."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how you can build your stair-climbing endurance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to be less winded after climbing the stairs, start doing it more often (as long as you don’t have any underlying conditions that can put your health at risk). If you have issues such as heart failure or COPD that make climbing stairs a challenge, get those treated first, Pohlgeers stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your body adapts to imposed demands on it. So, if you’re practicing going up the stairs, you become more efficient,” Erickson said. The muscles needed to climb the stairs will strengthen the more you use them, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ll ask patients, actually, that are getting ready to go into surgery, it’s like a pre-op clearance: ‘Could you carry groceries up three to four flights of stairs?’” Pohlgeers explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s OK if you’re out of breath by the top of the three or four flights of stairs. The concern is can you physically do it without having symptoms like chest pain, vision changes or a headache, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you get up three or four flights of stairs as an average person carrying groceries, you’re good. That’s a very good sign,” Pohlgeers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Developing your base strength levels — doing &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/multimedia/lunge/vid-20084662" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="lunges" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695bd707e4b0c1bd90c46bc7" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/multimedia/lunge/vid-20084662" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;lunges&lt;/a&gt;, doing &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/multimedia/squat/vid-20084663" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="squats" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695bd707e4b0c1bd90c46bc7" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/multimedia/squat/vid-20084663" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;, that’s going to give you more power, more strength to go up [stairs],” Erickson added. Improving your cardiovascular fitness can also help decrease the fatigue you feel at the top of the stairs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When working on building up your endurance, do so gradually, Pohlgeers suggested. You don’t need to go up and down the stairs five times in a row. Instead, slowly build up your fitness ability in a sustainable and even enjoyable way, whether that’s by doing more yard work, going on walks with your neighbor or taking up gardening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you work on your strength and cardiovascular fitness, your stair-climbing endurance should also improve, according to Erickson. You’ll be easily climbing back-to-back flights of stairs in no time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 12:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQNml0UUNmQmFUTGE3Rm94ZmZabHlETDVjcnB2bExrTlpnZ211RDJ4WmNicmUxd2hoenNSTGZVUF81VHJjZXFVYUJqWnA3NWxHUng3M0RCSEt1NEZld1hNT3BLQnpzLVJuYjFId1pKZXkyYXJRa0xwRXMxbmNMSjNxc1g0X1R0djVBSXp6bHFpdE1nSU9uYXVlLXIzX2fSAaIBQVVfeXFMUEpBdEhqQUw5bXpJcHJpeGVGYmF2WnVQTmh3ejV6VkNoR0xjVGRsQVVNSkFRSWZVcXhpcU5YR1lEVENDbEI2TElKcHl0RmJ3NGJQXzVwN19TdlNSOVlQRnRQQ1FmZXRoYmNqWWRvN0tjQVA1TEZrNHVIbGhxckNDY3Ytb3dVbDFVVkU2MXZpYTNkY0FOanQ3UUFzZTNIb0NVWDJ3</guid></item><item><title>多动症药物起作用，但不是专家认为的那样-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2026/01/06/adhd-ritalin-sleep-children/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LUIFNLOHENCR7KGR7QXN2SAHCE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The stimulants Ritalin and Adderall have been used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) for decades, but research shows they don’t act on the brain’s attention circuitry as had long been assumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNTGNwSU5MakYwNzZyVDd1bVI3WWJVZTNaVGg2Ui1NaGxPRjN1RVVUOFVyczQtTnNJYkx5NUJOSTRvajdZdnQxNDRFZVZLNEpRaERaRjlOR0FwM3I2WEo2c3RiczZyWUxJa1hQMG9yOE9uT2U3N3lJY3FmNjVnbnlzVENIMA</guid></item><item><title>特朗普政府引发中期疫苗战争- Axios</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2026/01/06/trump-administration-rfk-midterms-vaccines-kids</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:07:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxQQnJfYWphZzY2YkJfUTUzNzlYTmNaZVB0NE5sLWUtSTY0QVA0Vms5Z05wTGpWWnpTOVBuR0pnTnZiX1JyaFFOQS12VDlWVDdWU1F3WThiLTFJd1ZIUFRsWGhHOUV6eGFLOEtCVDhQbWEtTjZGa28yZnhuRm5IcDROd0RRcnBCcVU</guid></item><item><title>为什么癌症可以在几年后复发—以及如何阻止它-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04149-3</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Lisa Dutton was declared free of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00265-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00265-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, she took a moment to celebrate with family and friends, even though she knew her cancer journey might not be over. As many as one-third of people whose breast tumours are cleared see &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01717-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01717-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;the disease come back&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes decades later. Many other cancers are known to recur in the years following an initial treatment, some at much higher rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s always in the back of your mind, and that can be stressful,” says Dutton, a retired health-care management consultant living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01570-6" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04149-3/d41586-025-04149-3_51849280.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Cancer-fighting immune cells could soon be engineered inside our bodies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of her treatment, Dutton had enrolled in a clinical trial called SURMOUNT. This would monitor her for sleeping cancer cells, which many researchers now think might explain at least some cancer recurrence&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These dormant tumour cells evade initial treatment and move to other parts of the body. Instead of multiplying to form tumours right away — as is typical for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02555-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02555-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;metastatic cancer&lt;/a&gt;, in which cells spread from the main tumour — the dormant cells remain asleep. They are hidden from &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00126-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00126-y" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;the immune system&lt;/a&gt; and not actively dividing. But later, they can reawaken and give rise to tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though Dutton understood that her treatment might not have removed all signs of cancer, she says she was floored in 2020 when dormant cells were found in her bone marrow for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are discovering dormant tumour cells, also known as disseminated cancer cells, in association with breast, prostate, lung, colon&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and other cancers, and these cells are increasingly implicated in some metastatic cancers. An estimated 30% of people who have been successfully treated for cancer might harbour these cells, although unpublished work suggests they could be even more common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, a flurry of efforts have attempted to identify and understand dormant cells, with the ultimate goal of treating them. A handful of clinical trials are now under way to test potential therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the first trial Dutton enrolled in only monitored the cells, she has since enrolled in a second, called CLEVER, that aims to eliminate them&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. As such trials move ahead, open questions about the sleeper cells, including what induces dormancy and how to fight it, are drawing more researchers into the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re starting to see multiple groups converging on some of the same ideas, which is always very affirming,” says Cyrus Ghajar, a cancer biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington. The trials under way are “a testament to just how much progress has been made”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A silent threat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The existence of dormant tumour cells was proposed as early as the 1930s, when Australian pathologist Rupert Willis attributed some secondary cancer growths to such cells&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. As people who had been treated for cancer began to live longer, he and others noticed that the disease sometimes returned much later, and was often even more aggressive. Despite this early proposal, the idea of dormancy didn’t catch on for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis Chodosh, a physician-scientist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, recalls facing resistance when he began discussing the idea with colleagues more than 20 years ago. No one wanted to believe that cancer-killing drugs might be leaving something behind, he says, and drug companies weren’t interested in developing therapies for people who seemed to have been cured. Many scientists at the time said that recurrent cancers must instead be new, not linked to any past diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s only when enough evidence accumulates that you get pushed out of this way of thinking,” says Chodosh, who is a co-investigator on the SURMOUNT and CLEVER studies alongside Angela DeMichele, a medical oncologist at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04149-3/d41586-025-04149-3_51843414.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04149-3/d41586-025-04149-3_51843414.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Researchers Angela DeMichele and Lewis Chodosh stand at the interior window of a large medical building." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04149-3/d41586-025-04149-3_51843414.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Angela DeMichele (left) and Lewis Chodosh are investigating ways to target dormant tumour cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Peggy Peterson for Penn Medicine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a handful of cellular markers, researchers have now identified dormant tumour cells in many parts of the body&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. These markers can tell scientists not only whether the cells are growing and dividing, but also where the cells originated and therefore &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01110-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01110-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;which type of cancer&lt;/a&gt; they’re associated with. The methods aren’t perfect, however, and researchers are still trying to determine whether certain cells are more likely to go dormant than others, and which features define these cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghajar and others have found that dormant cells leave the primary tumour early in a cancer’s progression, often before the disease has been diagnosed&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. How and why these cells break away isn’t entirely clear, but after spending just minutes in circulation, they exit the bloodstream and concentrate in certain parts of the body, such as the bone marrow and lymph nodes. Even in these niches, dormant cells are extremely rare, amounting to just a handful among millions of healthy cells, he says. Their state of suspended animation shields them from conventional treatments, such as chemotherapy, that target rapidly dividing cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petros Tsantoulis, a medical oncologist at the University of Geneva in Switzerland, says that dormancy differs from &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01370-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01370-4" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;other known states such as senescence&lt;/a&gt;, in which old cells stop dividing as they prepare to die. Given the right conditions, dormant cells can begin dividing anew. Once reawakened, dormant cells multiply into tumours that replicate the full complexity of the original tumour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has led some researchers to suggest that dormant tumour cells might be cancer stem cells, a type of cell that through renewal and differentiation might give rise to the tumour — or that, at least, they might be cancer cells with stem-like features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00216-3" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04149-3/d41586-025-04149-3_26701508.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Forget lung, breast or prostate cancer: why tumour naming needs to change&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dormant tumour cells have some characteristics that are commonly associated with stem cells, such as the overexpression of certain genes. Cancer biologist Joan Massagué, director of the Sloan Kettering Institute in New York City, says that stem cells spend most of their time dormant, waking only after an injury or illness — making them obvious candidates. Still, the existence of cancer stem cells is a contentious idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists seem poised to resolve some of these open questions soon. With advanced laboratory techniques that give researchers the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03768-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03768-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;study individual cells&lt;/a&gt; more closely, it’s now possible to identify, isolate and enrich dormant tumour cells for further study. Chodosh and DeMichele’s team, for example, is developing an assay to identify dormant cells. Chodosh says it is much more sensitive than existing approaches, and might ultimately improve estimates of how many people harbour dormant cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghajar, meanwhile, is settling on a different way of thinking about these cells. If a dormant cell from a breast tumour ends up in the bone marrow, for example, it might be expected to retain many features of a breast cancer cell that would enable its identification. “But what we’re finding is that these expectations don’t hold up,” Ghajar says, noting that once a cancer cell spreads, it often changes its shape, size and behaviour. “We’re going to have to go beyond a definition based on unifying features, and instead map the mutations in these cells to mutations in the originating tumour — to define a disseminated cell not by what we think it should look like, but what its genome tells us it is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep–wake signals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond defining dormancy, researchers want to understand how and why cells go dormant, and what sorts of triggers reawaken them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Judith Agudo, an immunologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts, cells probably enter dormancy as a protective measure. As part of a tumour, individual cells might be insulated from attack by the immune system, but once on their own, “they can easily be picked off without taking steps to hide themselves”, she says. In addition, the journey through the body to a new niche is a stressful one that kills the vast majority of cells that break away. Dormancy is one way of persisting in a harsh environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that while cells are asleep, they continue to engage in crosstalk with their microenvironment&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and modify themselves to actively maintain dormancy. For example, dormant cells seem to alter the expression patterns of genes involved in cell survival, including a central regulator of cell metabolism and growth called the mTOR pathway&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The cells also exploit a form of self-recycling called autophagy — literally ‘self-eating’ — that allows dormant cells to repurpose internal resources and survive with little input from their surroundings&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cells seem to have a complex relationship with their external environment, too, including the immune system. Julio Aguirre-Ghiso, founding director of the Cancer Dormancy Institute at the Montefiore Einstein Comprehensive Cancer Center in New York City, says that the immune response is implicated not only in inducing dormancy, but also in maintaining and ending it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his team have shown that macrophages in the lungs produce a particular protein that binds to dormant breast cancer cells and reinforces dormancy&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Other research has demonstrated how dormant cells can evade surveillance by immune-system cells, including T cells&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and natural killer cells&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR12" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the research suggests that cells most often remain dormant until the immune landscape is disrupted in some way, shifting the balance enough for cells to reawaken safely. These shifts might involve injury or illness, with studies in the past few years linking cellular damage&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR13" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and COVID-19 and influenza infections&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR14" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to an escape from dormancy.

Cells are constantly attempting to exit dormancy after small perturbations, only to be killed. “But in moments when the balance is disrupted, that’s when we often see metastasis taking off,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peyton’s work focuses on fibrosis, the build-up of fibrous connective tissue at a damaged site. This is often associated with cancer, because stiffness helps the tumour to grow and aids in signalling between cells. But the bone marrow, where dormant cells often reside, is soft, and Peyton is interested in whether that soft environment might be one feature reinforcing dormancy. She says it’s possible that natural, age-related loss of bone density (osteoporosis) or hormonal changes in women who previously had breast cancer could trigger fibrosis, and potentially a reawakening of their cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The notion behind &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/intermittent-fasting-does-work-for-weight-loss-but-only-if-you-follow-this-rule"&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt; is simple: eat less for a time, improve your metabolism. The reality is more complex, and a new study finds that some forms of intermittent fasting do not alter markers of metabolic or cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers, led by a team from the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbruecke (DIfE), put 31 women &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fat-cells-seem-to-cling-to-the-memory-of-being-obese-study-finds"&gt;who were overweight&lt;/a&gt; or obese on two different intermittent fasting schedules for two weeks each. The schedules were 8 am to 4 pm or 1 pm to 9 pm, a particular kind of intermittent fasting known as time-restricted eating (TRE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the timing of the schedules differed, the diet parameters were the same: participants could eat &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/high-fat-diets-may-break-the-brains-ability-to-regulate-calories"&gt;like they normally did&lt;/a&gt;, and therefore take in the same amount of total calories (making this what's known as an isocaloric study).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-fasting-style-diet-seems-to-result-in-dynamic-changes-to-human-brains"&gt;A Fasting-Style Diet Seems to Result in Dynamic Changes to Human Brains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the women lost some weight, other benefits that might be expected based on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2018.04.010"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; – including lower blood sugar levels, lower blood pressure, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experts-reveal-how-to-actually-lower-your-cholesterol"&gt;lower cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; – didn't show up in the data, raising questions about just how effective these timed fasting routines are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The beneficial cardiometabolic effects described previously might be induced by TRE-mediated calorie restriction and not by the shortening of the eating window itself," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adv6787"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this nearly isocaloric trial, no improvements in metabolic parameters were observed after two weeks of TRE."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_187651" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187651" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/GlucoseProfile.jpg" alt="Glucose level chart" class="wp-image-187651 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/GlucoseProfile.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/GlucoseProfile-600x393.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-187651" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at health indicators like glucose levels. (Peters et al., &lt;em&gt;Sci. Transl.

The timing of their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-explain-why-you-wake-up-minutes-before-your-alarm"&gt;circadian rhythms&lt;/a&gt;, including those that nudge the body towards sleep, was shifted based on the TRE schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's more evidence that our internal clocks can be partially controlled by when we drink and eat, as well as through other triggers (such as when &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stunning-sunset-images-on-the-moon-could-help-solve-enduring-mystery"&gt;the Sun goes down&lt;/a&gt;). This could play into health problems associated with eating late at night, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those who want to lose weight or improve their metabolism should pay attention not only to the clock, but also to their energy balance," &lt;a href="https://www.dzd-ev.de/en/article/intervallfasten-ohne-kalorienreduktion-verbessert-nicht-die-stoffwechselgesundheit-verschiebt-aber-die-innere-uhr"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biologist and nutritionist Olga Ramich, from the DIfE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improving metabolic health is particularly important when tackling insulin resistance and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="187648" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.

It's possible that in hypocaloric scenarios (when calories are restricted), timing may have some influence on biological markers of health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various types of intermittent fasting continue to be analyzed by researchers, but studies &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-intermittent-fasting-has-2-key-benefits-for-people-with-obesity"&gt;can differ substantially&lt;/a&gt; in terms of the diets that are allowed, the participants, study duration, and the health benefits measured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest the importance of calorie restriction for metabolic improvements in TRE," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adv6787"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whether the timing of eating under the hypocaloric conditions can additionally contribute to metabolic changes and whether the optimal eating timing differs between individuals warrants investigation in future studies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adv6787"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Local doctors say a perfect storm has developed, a rapidly spreading strain of influenza A compounded by a drop in vaccination rates and an increase in holiday travel, which could elongate the flu surge into spring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“This is one of those seasons where everything is lining up in the wrong direction,” said Dr. Vandana Madhavan, clinical director of infectious disease at Mass General Brigham for Children. “It’s hard to say when our peak is going to be, and in some years, we see a second peak.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At the end of December, the number of visits to health care providers for flu-like illness jumped to 11.8 percent, up from 7.6 percent the week before, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/influenza-reporting" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/influenza-reporting"&gt;Massachusetts Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. The share of emergency room visits that resulted in a hospitalization for influenza rose to 9 percent — nearly double from the previous week and triple the rate from the same time last year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Each day last week, there were nearly 9,000 emergency department visits statewide, with about one-quarter of those related to acute respiratory illness, including flu, COVID-19, and RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Last year, flu hospitalizations in Massachusetts peaked in early February, when about 10.5 percent of hospital admissions were attributed to influenza. This year’s trajectory suggests the state could meet or surpass that mark, said Dr. Larry Madoff, of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The flu season is likely to continue well into the spring. Typically, it doesn’t peak until late January or February,” said Madoff, medical director of the department’s Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Starting Tuesday, Brown University Health will require surgical masks or N95s for all patients, visitors, and staff at all times across its locations in Massachusetts and Rhode Island due to high rates of hospital infections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Nationally, the picture is similarly grim. Through Dec. 27, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; reported “very high” flu activity in more than half the states. The agency estimates there have been at least 11 million illnesses, 120,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths so far this season, including at least nine children nationwide. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In the state, 32 influenza-related deaths have been reported this season — 29 adults and three children, including &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/05/metro/massachusetts-pediatric-death-influenza/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/05/metro/massachusetts-pediatric-death-influenza/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link"&gt;one child who died during Christmas week&lt;/a&gt;. Last season, which ran from fall to summer, there were 470 influenza-related deaths. The state is also reviewing two possible COVID-19-associated deaths and one RSV-associated death in individuals younger than 18 years.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Influenza is a contagious viral illness that attacks the respiratory system, including the nose, throat, and lungs. Typical symptoms include high fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, and extreme fatigue, sometimes accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. This season, clinicians are reporting fevers as high as 104 or 105 degrees in some patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Doctors say the intensity of this year’s outbreak is driven by a dominant strain of influenza A H3N2 — specifically, a genetic variant known as &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/18/metro/new-flu-strain-massachusetts-subclade-k/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/18/metro/new-flu-strain-massachusetts-subclade-k/"&gt;subclade K&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Among influenza A H3N2 viruses that have undergone further genetic analysis at the CDC, about 90 percent belong to subclade K. While experts are still studying whether it causes more severe disease, early evidence suggests it spreads more quickly and may be better at evading existing community immunity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Internationally, subclade K has already raised alarms. Health leaders in the United Kingdom warned in November of a “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/14/flu-mutated-strain-uk-hospitals-winter-surge" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/14/flu-mutated-strain-uk-hospitals-winter-surge"&gt;once-in-a-decade&lt;/a&gt;” winter flu surge as infections rose sharply among young people. The strain has also been detected in Canada and Japan, where authorities declared a &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-general/japan-sees-early-flu-activity-school-closures#:~:text=Japan%20is%20seeing%20early%20and,Smederevac%20/%20iStock" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-general/japan-sees-early-flu-activity-school-closures#:~:text=Japan%20is%20seeing%20early%20and,Smederevac%20/%20iStock"&gt;flu epidemic as early as October&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It really did feel like a switch flipped,” said Dr. Zachary Binder, an associate professor of pediatrics at UMass Chan Medical School and a pediatric emergency medicine physician at UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester. “We went from seeing hardly any flu to over half the patients in the emergency department being flu positive.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Binder said more than half the patients he treated in recent weeks had influenza A, and many children experienced febrile seizures triggered by dangerously high fevers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We are seeing an absolute explosion in flu cases over the last few weeks,” Binder said. “When we see kind of severe cases, even death, it’s most often in children with underlying health conditions like asthma, other respiratory illnesses, or cardiac illnesses.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Another major factor is the lack of vaccination. Only about 34 percent of Massachusetts residents have received a flu shot so far this season, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/immunizations-for-respiratory-diseases" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/immunizations-for-respiratory-diseases"&gt;state’s tracker&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a drop from last year, when roughly 40 percent of residents were vaccinated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Complicating matters further, the &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/everything-you-need-know-about-subclade-k-flu-and-vaccine-protection-against-it" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;newly mutated strain&lt;/a&gt;, which was surging earlier in the UK, appears to be only a partial match to &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/09/03/metro/healey-covid-booster-massachusetts-trump-kennedy-vaccine-2/?p1=StaffPage&amp;amp;p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link&amp;amp;p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;this year’s vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. Each year, scientists must predict which flu strains are most likely to circulate months in advance, and this year’s prediction missed the mark.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Madoff, of the state’s Department of Public Health, said even though the circulating strain “is not a perfect match for the vaccine, a vaccine is far better than no vaccine.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He said it’s unfortunate that more people are choosing not to vaccinate in the state, and combats the federal health officials’ &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/05/nation/childhood-vaccine-cdc-schedule-overhaul/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/05/nation/childhood-vaccine-cdc-schedule-overhaul/"&gt;decision Monday&lt;/a&gt; to slash recommended childhood vaccinations under President Trump’s directive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I think it’s the wrong move at the wrong time,” Madoff said. “It flies in the face of what doctors recommend and what our professional organizations recommend. This guidance seems to backtrack on important protections for our children, and backing off on those recommendations, weakening those recommendations in any way, is exactly the wrong thing to be doing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The reasons for declining flu vaccination rates are complex. Some experts point to pandemic fatigue such as&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;reduced routine care visits, and lingering skepticism about vaccines following COVID-19. Others note that people may underestimate the severity of influenza compared with other respiratory viruses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Still, physicians in Massachusetts stress that the vaccine significantly reduces the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It does take a couple of weeks to get full protection from vaccination,” Madhavan said. “Now is the time, if you haven’t gotten vaccinated, to get vaccinated, to get some protection on board. And I would say that for COVID as well.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Pediatric specialists say they are seeing more &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/12/22/metro/super-flu-virus-children-kids/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/12/22/metro/super-flu-virus-children-kids/"&gt;severe complications in children&lt;/a&gt; than usual. Madhavan, with Mass General Brigham for Children, said she has treated patients with acute necrotizing encephalopathy, a rare but serious complication of influenza that can cause sudden changes in mental status, difficulty speaking or eating, problems with movement, and, in severe cases, trouble breathing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Severe flu cases are more common in children with underlying health conditions, but even otherwise healthy children can become critically ill, doctors warn. Parents are urged to watch for signs of dehydration, difficulty breathing, persistent high fever, or lethargy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For home care, Madhavan recommends aggressive hydration, including popsicles and electrolyte solutions like Pedialyte, along with controlling fever using ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Honey can help soothe coughs in children older than 1, she recommends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;COVID-19 activity in Massachusetts remains relatively low compared with influenza, though health officials caution that seasonal waves can overlap.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For now, doctors and public health officials are urging residents to get vaccinated, stay home when sick, wash hands frequently, and seek medical care early if symptoms worsen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Madoff recommends residents seek care as soon as symptoms onset.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“There are treatments available, and the earlier those treatments are started, the more beneficial they are,” he said. “For the vulnerable populations like young children, older adults, those with underlying medical conditions, those with respiratory issues or cardiovascular issues, Tamiflu and other treatments can be lifesaving.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

They’re known to play a significant role in putting us in a state of rest and digest (as opposed to fight or flight), and studies have shown that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can calm and regulate some bodily functions. (The potential cardiac side effects of stimulating the right means that VNS concentrates almost exclusively on the left.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="n-content-pullquote o3-editorial-typography-pullquote n-content-pullquote--no-image" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started to feel I had more energy just after the first week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most notably, VNS implants have long been used by doctors to treat epilepsy. But the vagus nerve can also be stimulated via the skin, usually in or around the left ear, using small electrical pulses that give a tingling sensation. A number of devices on the market claim to do this safely, and some have been shown to have positive effects for specific conditions. One, &lt;a href="https://gammacore.co.uk/" title="" data-trackable="link"&gt;GammaCore&lt;/a&gt;, is available on the NHS to treat cluster headaches via neck-based VNS. Another, made by German firm tVNS Technologies, is being used in a £2mn study (&lt;a href="https://sheffield.ac.uk/ctru/current-trials/triceps" title="" data-trackable="link"&gt;Triceps&lt;/a&gt;) at Sheffield University into treating arm weakness following a stroke, funded by the NIHR Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation board, the Association of British Neurologists and the Stroke Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="mdnrlywm" class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3Ad1c0c20a-1fc2-48c3-8b00-c094481fefc8?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x,https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3Ad1c0c20a-1fc2-48c3-8b00-c094481fefc8?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3Ad1c0c20a-1fc2-48c3-8b00-c094481fefc8?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fd1c0c20a-1fc2-48c3-8b00-c094481fefc8.jpg?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1" alt="Yōjō vagus stimulation device and subscription, £399 per year" data-image-type="image" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="n-content-picture__caption o3-editorial-typography-caption"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yōjō vagus stimulation device and subscription, £399 per year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manufacturers indicate that the nerve’s size means that stimulating it could have wider beneficial effects relating to fatigue, digestive disorders and more. Parasym, makers of a device called &lt;a href="https://nurosym.com/en-gb" title="" data-trackable="link"&gt;Nurosym&lt;/a&gt;, has published more than 50 clinical studies including one showing a 32 per cent improvement in memory. Anecdotal evidence, meanwhile, is rich. “My energy levels have been such an obvious difference,” says Andrea, COO of a medical education company, who uses a device called &lt;a href="https://www.yojo.health/" title="" data-trackable="link"&gt;Yōjō&lt;/a&gt; to treat chronic migraines. “I started to feel like I had more energy just after the first week.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="xwluzhqk" class="n-content-heading-2 o3-editorial-typography-chapter"&gt;No&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word “vague” comes from the same Latin word, and could be used to describe some of the feelgood claims made for VNS devices. While users have credited them with improving sleep patterns, symptoms of IBS and much else, the reasons are not properly understood. “It might improve someone’s mental health, and if it works for them then who am I to argue, but as a doctor I can’t prescribe it,” says Professor Arshad Majid, chief investigator of the Triceps trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout" data-layout-name="card" data-layout-width="full-width"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__container"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__slot"&gt;&lt;figure class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3A96e0d359-753a-4895-b618-fb4547ae8fa7?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x,https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3A96e0d359-753a-4895-b618-fb4547ae8fa7?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F96e0d359-753a-4895-b618-fb4547ae8fa7.png?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1" alt="TVNS E with Legacy Electrode, €3,500" data-image-type="image" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;TVNS E with Legacy Electrode&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; €3,500&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop.t-vns.com/en/" title="" data-trackable="link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__slot"&gt;&lt;figure class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3A29a79fe6-b45d-4e6c-bd3e-23617966c0ad?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x,https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3A29a79fe6-b45d-4e6c-bd3e-23617966c0ad?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F29a79fe6-b45d-4e6c-bd3e-23617966c0ad.png?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1" alt="Nurosym, €700" data-image-type="image" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nurosym&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;£599&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nurosym.com/en-gb/products/nurosym-v2" title="" data-trackable="link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To be able to understand which device is better, we would need some sort of signal of efficacy to measure,” he continues. For its part, Yōjō pairs with an app that does a face scan via your phone’s camera to estimate blood pressure, HRV and pulse, with the aim of building up a picture of said efficacy – but in my own tests its estimation of my blood pressure was rather different to readings from a cuff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Stimulating the vagus nerve pathway via the ear is biologically plausible, but there are many questions left to answer – which stimulation settings? When? For how long?” says Tiago da Silva Costa, senior research fellow in Psychiatry at Newcastle University. His colleague, Hamish McAllister-Williams, professor of affective disorders at the same institution, agrees. “I think that the main benefit that people get from some devices may be more of a placebo response. But they are probably safe, probably do not harm and may at least get people to relax for periods of the day.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Financial Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 11:00:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFByM2VFR3NoVk85WHVORW5leTZPYUxMMC1FN2dKVzljVHd3Z1lPQ2dVRi10UTRWVGlvclEwOFU1U19vMWs2NWVfX1dseWxfNk1iWUZnRV9mVG9KZHVoYWZtLVpzcy1XTkFFeDZZeVlJUVc</guid></item><item><title>如何帮助身体排毒- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20260105-how-to-help-your-body-detox-itself</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-85f9acf9-0 kfxpiP"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Fibre also helps &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5105045/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;protect the kidneys and liver&lt;/a&gt; – both crucial for removing toxins from the body – by protecting them from harmful bacteria and helping beneficial bacteria to grow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;To &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/food/articles/fibremaxxing" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;increase your fibre intake&lt;/a&gt;, plant-based foods are your best bet. Dried fruits like apricots, leafy vegetables like spinach and legumes like a chickpeas, lentils and beans are all high in fibre, as are porridge oats and wholewheat bread and pasta. Snack on &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/nutrition/high-fiber-foods" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;apples, berries, nuts, seeds, popcorn&lt;/a&gt; or roasted pulses. Lots of variety is key, since there are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963996925001802#b0645" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;lots of different fibres with different properties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;&lt;span id="drink-more-water" class="sc-d16436d-0 gCPVhV"&gt;&lt;b id="drink-more-water" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Drink more water&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 gCPVhV"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Water helps to remove toxins from the body by helping the kidneys and liver to excrete waste. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The kidneys, for instance, use water to flush out toxins such as &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.kidney.org.uk/kidneys-the-basics" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;sodium and urea&lt;/a&gt;.

Drinking enough water can also help protect your kidneys in the long run – one review of 18 randomised controlled trials found that drinking more water could &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2827021" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;help reduce the risk of kidney stones&lt;/a&gt;, among other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So how much water is enough to help your body perform these essential functions? The widespread advice of eight glasses of water (around two litres) is outdated, stemming from &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190403-how-much-water-should-you-drink-a-day" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;advice in 1945&lt;/a&gt; which included food as a source of water.

It was followed by quick jolts, like electric shocks. As each class came and went, the pain eased and then returned with greater intensity. Four times that day I left a teaching assistant with worksheets and ran to the school bathroom to douse my face with cold water. I took ibuprofen, paracetamol, aspirin, but the pain remained unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The headaches appeared repeatedly that autumn, and again in spring, and soon formed an annual pattern. September and October were the worst, then February and March. I could predict the routine: aura in the shower, early twinges on the train, full-blown agony in class by 9.30am. In late 2019, a GP finally referred me to a neurologist and I was diagnosed with cluster headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-v6upx6"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Cluster headaches typically begin with severe pain around one eye that lasts up to three hours &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;About one in 1,000 &lt;a href="https://www.brainresearchuk.org.uk/neurological-conditions/cluster-headache" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;people are affected&lt;/a&gt; by the condition, and men are more frequently diagnosed. Cluster headaches typically begin with sudden, severe pain around one eye that peaks within minutes and lasts up to three hours.

Her attacks began when she was two. “I would throw myself on the floor and bang my head. That was put down to being spoiled,” she says. Her symptoms worsened through childhood. Alcohol in her teens, &lt;a href="https://headachejournal.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-4610.2008.01317.x" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;like many triggers&lt;/a&gt;, made things worse. After drinking sherry at her school leaving party, she recalls barely being able to see on the bus home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Her family often interpreted her attacks as drunken episodes. Support eventually came from her father and then from her husband, Rod, who was diagnosed with epilepsy in early adulthood. “I was very lucky to find such an exceptional person,” she says. “We were meant to meet.” Hobbs took clerical work after moving to Wales in 1981, but often hid her condition. She was fired from one job, partly due to absences during attacks. Her breakthrough diagnosis came in 2002 at the &lt;a href="https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/our-services/our-hospitals/national-hospital-neurology-and-neurosurgery" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery&lt;/a&gt; in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Still, the inability to plan life around unpredictable attacks took its toll. She especially hated being unable to plan social events, being seen as unreliable as a colleague, and even having to be looked after by her children (at home and in public) in the midst of the paralysis caused by the worst episodes. “It robs you of the small freedoms we don’t appreciate until they’re gone,” she says. She remembers winning tickets for the queen’s golden jubilee concert, only to have an attack inside a portable toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;eadaches have been described throughout history. “The first description of headache comes by&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;way of the Mesopotamians in 4000BC,” write Seymour Diamond and Mary Franklin in their 2005 book, Headache Through the Ages. They attributed the disease to Tiu, an evil spirit who attacked his victims’ heads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/bhm.2018.0030" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Ebers Papyrus&lt;/a&gt;, a record of ancient Egyptian medical knowledge dating from 1550BC, suggests crocodiles should be wrapped around the head to combat what some modern-day observers would describe as a migraine. In the middle ages, migraine was recognised as a distinct disorder, with treatments ranging from bloodletting and herbal concoctions to other, more superstitious remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It was the Dutch physician Nicolaes Tulp who provided the first detailed description of a cluster headache. In his Observationes Medicae, published in 1641, Tulp speaks of a patient “afflicted with a very severe headache occurring and disappearing daily at fixed hours”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cluster headaches were only officially recognised by the Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society in 1988. From the 1960s to the late 1990s, they were thought to be caused by a problem with the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain, says Prof Peter Goadsby, a leading specialist in diagnosing and treating the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 1998, Goadsby and the neuroscientist Arne May published the results of a study for which they had triggered cluster headaches in patients and &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(98)02470-2/abstract" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;monitored the attacks in a brain scanner&lt;/a&gt;. The results, published in the Lancet, showed activation of the hypothalamus, which is responsible for human circadian rhythm, when patients were in pain, and a deactivation when they recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="39a021b3-9aca-491f-8889-de01d30b7492" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Jamie Charteris’s cluster headaches were misdiagnosed as sinus problems.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Handout&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Despite such advances, diagnosis remains slow. Jamie Charteris’s attacks began in 1986 and felt like “a modelling balloon being inflated behind my left eye”. GPs thought he had sinus problems; he underwent four surgeries before finally being diagnosed in 2014, after a doctor Googled his symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Nicholas Silver, a neurologist at the Walton Centre in Liverpool, says delays in diagnosis and treatment happen because patients are rarely seen mid-attack. “You’re tired and depressed, but not in agony,” he says. He proceeds by ruling out other primary headache disorders, such as migraine, tension-type, &lt;em&gt;hemicrania continua&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;paroxysmal hemicrania&lt;/em&gt; and SUNCT (short-lasting unilateral neuralgiformheadache), before diagnosing cluster headaches. A detailed history is essential: on which side do symptoms appear? For how long? What time of year? Are there triggers, such as alcohol? Do symptoms change with touch? Certain features such as redness, tearing, drooping eyelids and nasal congestion help confirm cluster headaches. Once diagnosed, patients may be referred to specialist centres including the Walton, or rapid-access clinics such as the one I attend at St Thomas’ hospital in London. But many first arrive in A&amp;amp;E or are given inadequate treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dorothy Chapman, 78, is a trustee of the UK charity Ouch (&lt;a href="https://ouchuk.org/home" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Organisation for the Understanding of Cluster Headache&lt;/a&gt;). She has experienced cluster headaches for most of her life, although she hasn’t had an attack since 2016. When she was in her 20s, she had her teeth pulled because dentists misinterpreted her pain. She believes dentists still need much more awareness. When Charteris sought help from Ouch, it was Chapman who replied to his email. I remember calling the Ouch helpline during an attack in early 2021; a calm volunteer talked me through oxygen treatment and medication until the episode eased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) &lt;a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg150/ifp/chapter/Treatments-for-cluster-headache" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;guidance on treatment&lt;/a&gt; recommends sufferers are offered high-flow oxygen and/or the anti-migraine drug triptan delivered by injection or nasal spray. No tablets, painkillers or opioids should be used. Preventive options include verapamil, a blood pressure medication, which apparently soothes &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/aug/17/-sp-daniel-radcliffe-speculating-sexuality-harry-potter" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe’s&lt;/a&gt; bouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But Dr Giorgio Lambru, the consultant neurologist who diagnosed me, believes the Nice guidance needs updating to reflect a clearer treatment pathway and help GPs avoid misprescribing. For episodic patients, he says, timing is everything: “The duration of the bout dictates the treatment.” Short bouts with infrequent attacks are handled with abortive therapy alone: triptan injections or nasal sprays, plus oxygen. Longer or more intense bouts require preventives such as verapamil, sometimes paired with steroids, which act quickly before wearing off. Many patients also receive a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24313966/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;greater occipital nerve block&lt;/a&gt; during a bout – an injection into the side of the head where the pain is that reduces nerve activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-v6upx6"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;The Nice guidance needs updating to reflect a clearer treatment pathway and help GPs avoid misprescribing&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If these fail, Lambru may consider topiramate, an anti-epilepsy medication, or vagus nerve stimulation devices. Chronic patients sometimes require multiple nerve blocks, radio-frequency treatment or, in rare cases, neuromodulation through occipital nerve stimulation, in which a battery-operated device is implanted and zaps the nerve to calm it down. Lambru stresses that, unlike in migraines, frequent use of triptans to treat cluster headache rarely causes medication-overuse headaches – an important point missing from many GP guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Patients also experiment with other approaches: cold air, cold showers, intense exercise, caffeine, vitamin D and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/ng-interactive/2025/apr/23/cluster-headaches-magic-mushrooms-psilocybin" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in some cases psychedelics&lt;/a&gt;, though evidence remains largely anecdotal, according to Lambru. One promising emerging option is CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) targeting medication, used in migraine. Injectables such as galcanezumab, which aim to slow the potent inflammatory protein, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1813440" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;show potential for episodic&lt;/a&gt; cluster headache treatment &lt;a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/discontinued/gid-ta10425#:~:text=16%20November%202022-,Following%20on%20from%20information%20provided%20to%20NICE%20by%20the%20company,appraisal%20on%20its%20work%20programme." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;but are unavailable&lt;/a&gt; on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;My own treatment journey has involved preventives and acute options when bouts strike. I briefly tried verapamil, but Covid restrictions made the required ECG monitoring (because of risks to the conduction of the heart) difficult. Oral steroids helped me temporarily but couldn’t be used long-term because of the increased risk of harm, such as weakened bones, eyesight problems and diabetes. Greater occipital nerve blocks became my main preventive tool. The moment I sense patterns emerging, I call the headache clinic at St Thomas’, and the nurses fit me in as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="684642a1-00ea-47a6-bf79-d716bf41661e" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘Oxygen therapy constricts dilated blood vessels, reducing the pressure and pain’ … Morgan Ofori.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Ethan Parker/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When attacks hit, I use high-flow medical oxygen delivered to my home in tall industrial cylinders. The relief is extraordinary. Prof Goadsby and Dr Anna Cohen’s 2009 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19996400/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study showed oxygen&lt;/a&gt; could make patients pain-free within 15 minutes, leading to its approval by Nice. During a cluster attack, blood flow in the brain increases. Oxygen therapy constricts the dilated blood vessels, reducing the pressure and pain while calming down overactive nerves. The drug sumatriptan, which reduces the release of pain-causing chemicals and blocks pain signals from being transmitted to the brain, never worked for me, despite trying several forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hobbs also relies heavily on oxygen, though she believes demand-valve masks, which deliver big bursts of oxygen quickly, could improve outcomes. Ouch has campaigned for wider access to these masks, though Lambru notes evidence is still emerging. The challenge is that only about one in 10 UK patients use or have access to oxygen – a stark shortfall, considering its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;t Ouch’s annual conference in Newcastle last summer, about 100 sufferers gathered with neurologists. There were quiet rooms, oxygen stations and sessions on new research and coping strategies. A recurring theme was the need for better data. Headache diaries help clinicians recognise patterns, but until recently most were kept by hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Inspired by his own struggles, 37-year-old web developer Darshan Ramanagoudra created MyClusters, a free app for tracking attacks, triggers and treatment effectiveness. Within its first month, users from more than a dozen countries logged thousands of attacks. Ramanagoudra hopes better data will reduce misdiagnosis and strengthen research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“By the summer of 2023, I was getting multiple daily attacks. By the winter, it was about six a day, and that’s when I started reading a lot of medical papers,” says Ramanagoudra, who is based in the Netherlands. He consulted doctors and researchers to see what the online community in the Netherlands was saying, then started tracking it all on a spreadsheet. “It got a bit complicated, and I realised I could do pivot tables and things, but I figured someone else would want additional information. How were they going to do it?” The idea for MyClusters was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="469ffe48-c9f8-4f90-9ce5-4532f557ec09" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":32,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Cluster headaches are ‘the most painful condition on the planet’.

However, in terms of funding and research, “cluster headaches are given short shrift compared with the impact it has on our economies and on people’s individual lives”, he says. He believes this is a mistake. “It’s not a terminal disease, it’s a lifelong disease. But if you add up all the time a person spends being disabled by these bouts of head pain and other neurological symptoms, it adds up to a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I’ve just emerged from my latest autumn bout. This time the pain struck on the left side, a first for me, and I received my first multi-cranial block to treat it. I was injected four times in the side of my head, plus another shot at the back. I’m not needle-phobic; I imagine I’m giving blood from my skull. The approach seems to have worked. Using MyClusters to track patterns, I’ve been headache-free for nearly six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Winter brings respite, and is a time of calm. But sometime in this new year, I know the cycle will begin again. Cluster headaches are my own recurring, disabling season, never too far around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQaHMtcE9Ha09kMzBPY3lId0lGcEQ2cXIzU0FYZHRtd3pOOTE2Vjlya2hEOU1VVl9leDhpRUlhTWtxMXFEeFpIRy1UWGZDUXpWQk1kbkN6U1ZSb1FhOHlOTzItdFJxOW5OZ1ItMTk4cGR4amRDenk0Q0dCUGNiUU53LVhwUF9YQ2htdmh2NUk5VDlMbHZ2cW1FcVdxbjdoSlNtLUdpQ2llSHA</guid></item><item><title>特朗普， RFK大幅调整儿童疫苗接种时间表- Axios</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2026/01/05/trump-rfk-kennedy-vaccine-schedule-children</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 09:26:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxNcV9NZ2Q3NEdEWGVLdDlwbXhnWVJibGNNbUtiTkc4cGd3aU9TTmRGQzlzWUlzaDhxX1JmME1rMnRIQ1JnNWRNZWtfM2lCcElKdm1VRXdERXJ0cTZKT19GQnFFdkZkakVpcEV0Q2R6cnNtejg1MjZEQmV3bGk0ci1OeHRn</guid></item><item><title>我每周不做饭就吃30棵植物，养成4种节省时间的习惯- Business Insider</title><link>https://www.businessinsider.com/eat-30-plants-week-fiber-gut-health-time-saving-habits-2025-12</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="post-body-content post-story-body-content" data-component-type="post-body-content" data-load-strategy="exclude" data-track-content="" data-post-type="story" data-track-marfeel="post-body-content"&gt;

I looked at a raspberry and saw only unappealing little hairs. Even a slice of buttered whole wheat toast had me running for the door because it tasted too healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around five years ago, I realized that I needed to expand my culinary horizons, if not for the enjoyment then for my health. Fruits, vegetables, as well as wholegrains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, not only contain micronutrients and vitamins crucial for bodily processes and general health, they're also high in gut-friendly fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00031-18" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt; called The American Gut Project found that people who ate 30 plant foods a week had more "good" bacteria and less "bad" bacteria in their guts than those who ate 10.

            &lt;p&gt;I always keep a bag of spinach and a bag of kale in my freezer and add them to any meal lacking veggies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-salad-greens-are-good-for-brain-health-aging-2024-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Dark leafy greens&lt;/a&gt; not only contain fiber, but are high in chlorophyll, the molecule that gives them their rich color. Chlorophyll is densely packed with essential nutrients, including iron, magnesium, and nitrogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes seconds to reach for a handful of frozen leaves, and I can add them to almost anything I'm cooking, from pasta sauce or curry, to scrambled eggs. It involves no preparation or additional steps, and instantly makes any meal more nutritious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4200054b-7a25-4029-a183-d633283a6897" data-toc-id="4200054b-7a25-4029-a183-d633283a6897"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always have pre-cooked grains to hand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I set myself a goal of buying at least three types of vegetables a week, and making sure I eat them before they spoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they don't pair well with my meals, I eat them as a snack. For example, I recently chopped up a whole cabbage, cooked it down on the stovetop with garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and rice vinegar, and warmed up little portions throughout the week whenever I felt like it. It took about 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find this helpful little challenge gets me in the habit of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-eat-more-fiber-without-feeling-gassy-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;adding more plants&lt;/a&gt; to my diet because I get dopamine from "winning" the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that I've developed these habits, I don't worry too much about hitting my plant count because I know I'm consistently eating fiber-filled, nutritious foods.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Stanford neuroscientist Andrew Huberman says one &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/daily-routines-successful-business-people-share-power-hours-2026-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;morning habit&lt;/a&gt; plays a key role in his overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.gq.com/story/andrew-huberman-diet-advice" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;with GQ&lt;/a&gt; published on Monday, the host of the popular "Huberman Lab" podcast shared the routines he's relying on to stay healthy in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Getting your physical health right — which puts your mental health in the best possible place — is all about intentionally high cortisol in the morning and intentionally low cortisol at night," Huberman told GQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although cortisol has a bad reputation as a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reference/how-to-lower-cortisol" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;stress hormone&lt;/a&gt;, Huberman says it plays an important role in how the body transitions from sleep to wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, you wake up in the morning because of a rise in cortisol. You want a big, massive spike of cortisol in the morning. If you don't spike your morning cortisol, your cortisol spikes in the afternoon or evening, and then everything goes awry, OK? You want your morning cortisol at least 30x higher than your nighttime cortisol," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;One way to keep that rhythm on track would be to send the body a signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The best way to spike your morning cortisol is to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kate-hudson-morning-routine-phone-free-sunlight-outdoors-meditation-2025-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;get bright light&lt;/a&gt; — ideally from sunlight — in your eyes in the first hour after waking. If you can't do that, maybe invest in a 10,000 Lux artificial light," Huberman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that's not possible, he suggests flipping on "as many artificial lights as you can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've made a mistake in the past — a tactical mistake, a strategic mistake — by calling it sunlight&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; People say, 'It's overcast.' What we should say is, 'Get daylight in your eyes,'" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having dim mornings and bright nights is "the worst way to go," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light exposure isn't the only thing Huberman says matters in the morning. He also encourages people to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/helen-mirren-aging-wellness-fitness-routine-exercise-military-workout-longevity-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;fit in a workout&lt;/a&gt; if they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you don't have time to exercise first thing in the morning, you need bodily movement. Even some knee bends, some arm swings, some jumping jacks. Movement generates cortisol and adrenaline," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to winding down at night, people should take the opposite approach, Huberman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you want to wear BluBlockers, you can. But dim the lights down, avoid caffeine. If you're going to exercise, don't make it terribly intense," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of getting light in the mornings are supported by broader research in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mariana Figueiro, professor and director of the Light and Health Research Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, told Business Insider in 2023 that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-huberman-swears-by-morning-sunlight-healthy-circadian-clock-2023-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;getting daylight&lt;/a&gt; is "just as important as diet and exercise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Light in the built environment is not always strong enough to synchronize the biological clock," Figueiro said. "The beauty of daylight is that daylight is the right amount, it's the right color, it's on at the right time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, getting enough darkness at night is just as crucial, since circadian disruption has been linked to poor cognitive performance and a weakened immune system, Figueiro said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="photo-by"&gt;Elena Leya&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As 2025 drew to a close, you were no doubt flooded with social media posts from your family, friends, work colleagues, and those randoms that somehow show up in your feed ‘cause the algorithm said so’. They were probably full of reflections on the year just gone, and full of hope for the year ahead. This time, they said, things will be different. A fresh start. A new them (funnily enough, that’s what last year’s posts said too). You may have made a similar post yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common of all new year’s resolutions is a commitment to improving physical and mental health. Working less. Sleeping more. Getting out on the bike more often. And of course, eating better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the thing with new year’s resolutions, like most overly optimistic plans, is that they rarely survive contact with the real world. Those couple of weeks of blue-sky thinking in late December quickly make way for the sad realities of February; realities that were so obvious in hindsight yet completely overlooked at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this piece, we’re going to take a different look at nutrition-related new year’s resolutions, and leave you with some ideas that might help make dietary changes that survive to see the start of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="https://escapecollective.com/content/images/2026/01/carson-arias-7zZLoemCauo-unsplash.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://escapecollective.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/carson-arias-7zZLoemCauo-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://escapecollective.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/carson-arias-7zZLoemCauo-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://escapecollective.com/content/images/size/w1600/2026/01/carson-arias-7zZLoemCauo-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://escapecollective.com/content/images/2026/01/carson-arias-7zZLoemCauo-unsplash.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;New year, new you? Best to make sure your goals are realistic, and worthwhile. (Image: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@carsonarias?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Carson Arias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; / Unsplash)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="what%E2%80%99s-the-goal"&gt;What’s the goal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is often where new year’s resolutions go to die. We’ve all set lofty, overly ambitious goals for our eating (or other lifestyle) habits, that in hindsight we never had a chance in hell of achieving. But it’s bigger than that. The number-one nutrition-related new year’s resolution that most people have, cyclist or not, is weight loss. Some people set modest, realistic expectations for what they might achieve. Others have goals of being leaner than they were in high school (20+ years ago, before kids and that sedentary desk job).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the level of ambition, I’m going to suggest that setting a weight loss goal is not the smartest approach to making dietary changes, for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being leaner, and becoming leaner, are two very different things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are those who are naturally on the leaner side, seemingly no matter what they do. Then there’s everyone else. And the concern here is not necessarily about being leaner, but about the process required for many of us to get there and stay there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being in a caloric deficit can have many physiological and psychological consequences and the more aggressive and prolonged the deficit, the more significant these become. They can range from poor performance on the bike due to inadequate fueling for the training you’re doing, through to health effects, in both male and female athletes, summarised by the term &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/57/17/1073?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (REDs)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This can include loss of bone density, loss of menstrual cycle in females, suppressed testosterone in males, and much more. There’s been plenty written on REDs and cyclists in recent years so I won’t rehash it all here, but if you’re not so familiar with the term then &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/goodweekendmag/reel/DQ8tgiziXua/?hl=id&amp;amp;ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;this short reel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; featuring &lt;em&gt;Escape Collective’s&lt;/em&gt; own Georgie Howe provides a bit of insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note though that this is not an issue unique to elite or professional athletes. Any large mismatch between training load and calorie intake can potentially have these consequences, and I’ve seen variations of this in riders of all ages, sexes, and abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

By comparison, the statewide average is 6.5 percent, and Hamilton County itself is at 6.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illness can cause symptoms like fever, body aches, coughing and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Harrison, a Hamilton County resident, told us those are the same symptoms he felt when he says he was diagnosed with the flu in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"I began to lose my ability to focus and continue engaged in the conversation," Harrison said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The fact that I got it at all, makes it seem worse than usual."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;State and federal health experts say the surge comes as influenza A(H3N2) continues to circulate widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chirag Patel, a pharmacist at Max Discount Pharmacy on Highway 58, told us local pharmacies and clinics are witnessing a surge in cases firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"We did not see that many flu cases last year and the previous year," said Patel. "This year, we already started early, around October, November, and now it's still going on. That's little bit red flag right there."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patel says detecting symptoms of the flu early can make a big difference in recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The first 48 hours after you having a first symptoms is really critical, Patel said."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC reports at least 11 million flu illnesses, 120,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths nationwide so far this season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One pediatric death was reported this week in Tennessee, bringing the season total to nine nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_imageEmbed__5mYLo"&gt;&lt;img alt="File photo: Getty Images." class="ImageEmbed_image__qZBo_" src="/resources/media2/16x9/612/986/0x32/90/07914280-83d3-4e02-8d02-9ee7be6c56ef-flushots2.jpg"&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_caption__gAtoE"&gt;&lt;p&gt;File photo: Getty Images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georgia officials are also reporting higher-than-average flu activity, signaling that the region is experiencing a particularly active season. Health authorities encourage residents six months and older to get vaccinated if they have not already and to take precautions such as frequent handwashing and staying home when sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu activity is expected to remain elevated in Tennessee and across the U.S. for several more weeks, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local hospitals and clinics are urging families to monitor symptoms and seek care early, especially for children, older adults, and those with chronic health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the latest guidance on influenza

class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The NHS has selected nine different conditions in total for the service which will be available through the NHS app in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The service, &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9317k58xkjo" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;which was first announced &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9317k58xkjo" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;, will allow patients to have assessments, check-ups and follow-up appointments online and will have its own dedicated team of doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The aim is to carry out 8.5 million appointments in the first three years – four times more than the average NHS trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But experts have questioned how it will be staffed and paid for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The nine conditions that will be prioritised initially are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;glaucoma&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;conditions affecting the retina at the back of the eye (including age-related macular

endometriosis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The expectation is more conditions will be added to this list in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;No patient will be forced down this route though, NHS England said, as they can still choose face-to-face appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Patients will have the option of using NHS Online when a GP makes a referral for specialist care. Instead of having a physical site, patients will be able to receive care from doctors around the country, directly through the NHS App.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Tests, scans or procedures that are needed will take place at healthcare sites close to patients' homes, while doctors review and assess their notes remotely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The government and NHS England believe the service will provide quicker access to care for patients and help relieve the pressure on in-person appointments, helping to cut waiting lists in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Health Secretary Wes Streeting insisted that "everyone will benefit" from using the online service, even if not using it directly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He told BBC Breakfast that those choosing to go online may be seen more quickly, freeing up space for those who want a face-to-face appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Professor Stella Vig, head of elective care at NHS England, said: "The NHS's new online hospital will see a huge shift in the way we deliver care, giving patients the option to have an online appointment with a specialist anywhere in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Regarding the nine conditions being prioritised, she said: "We know that these conditions can be painful and difficult to cope with so providing faster, more convenient access to diagnosis and treatments will have a real and positive impact on people's lives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Questions remain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Patients can already get test results on the NHS app and have online appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But this service builds on that by essentially offering a start-to-finish service digitally, building on some initiatives that have already been piloted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;For example, University Hospital Southampton developed a virtual follow-up service for low-risk inflammatory bowel disease, enabling patients to access care and support remotely when they had flare-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It meant the NHS trust could cut back on routine follow-up appointments. Three quarters of patients were managed virtually and the initiative was credited in reducing waiting times by 58%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Meanwhile, Moorfields Eye Hospital in London has introduced a virtual system for managing non-emergency eye referrals. More than half ended up being treated in routine clinics without the need for specialist treatment at Moorfields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Moorfields Eye Hospital consultant Peter Thomas said: "The impact is clear – patients are being seen more quickly in more appropriate settings, and the pressure on NHS services is being reduced."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Becks Fisher said, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said the service will be helpful for some and focussing on menopause and menstrual health "makes sense" given the long waits for gynaecology services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But she added "tricky questions remain", including how the service will be staffed and paid for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She also said: "NHS IT infrastructure could also pose a problem, as it will need to enable relevant information – like scan results – to be seen across different NHS organisations, something that is infamously difficult at the moment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/zhp28xs" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;Sign up here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 01:30:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFA1LVhvSHRDVlgwbDU1MzZ1Rlh0aG01cmtUWnY2QUh3MVpQbUFlNWtvMXFHUktqVVFwaGdvS245MUNLZTRTeHF3U0NkRjI5VTkzRXhfUVBOTk9DZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE92T2M1NUpTTUdKVlZvRE0zLXE1RWdlN2FwX2lPX0ZfeFFTQ1Fsem5LMmJ3bnBMTEN2WmdrU3FMNjZZSHRITUdERmk3TnJPdmJ2dzRKTzRYbm5TbE1QUHJN</guid></item><item><title>数以百万计的母亲细胞持续存在于您的体内，现在我们知道了方法- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/millions-of-your-mothers-cells-persist-inside-you-and-now-we-know-how</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Every human born on this planet is not entirely themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tiny fraction of our cells – around one in a million – is actually not our own, but comes from our mothers. That means each of us has millions of cells that our immune systems would normally recognize as foreign; yet somehow, in most of us, they hang around peacefully without causing any immune problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, immunologists have figured out why. A small number of maternal immune cells that cross the placenta during pregnancy actively train the fetus's immune system to tolerate the mother's cells for their entire life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-actually-have-secret-stripes-and-other-strange-markings"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Humans Actually Have Secret Stripes And Other Strange Markings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exchange of cells between a mother and a fetus is a well-documented phenomenon that scientists have known about for &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04102-4"&gt;more than 50 years&lt;/a&gt;. It's called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microchimerism"&gt;microchimerism&lt;/a&gt;, and it goes both ways: every human who has ever been pregnant retains cells from their fetus, and every human retains cells from their mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These lingering cells pose a puzzle for immunology, which is built around the idea that the immune system should mount an attack against foreign cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team led by pediatric infectious disease specialist Sing Sing Way of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center wanted to understand more about how these foreign maternal cells keep the immune system in check, and what role they play in shaping the fetus' immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out, the researchers studied maternal microchimerism in mice. Building on their &lt;a href="https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adf9325"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers bred mice with immune cells engineered to express specific cell surface markers. This allowed researchers to selectively deplete those cells and see whether or not immune tolerance was maintained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's where it got fascinating. A small subset of the maternal immune cells, with properties similar to bone marrow myeloid cells and dendritic cells, persisted long after birth. They were also strongly associated with both immune activity and the expansion of regulatory T cells – the cells that tell the immune system that everything is copacetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To confirm, the researchers next selectively edited out those specific maternal cells in offspring mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were dramatic. The regulatory T cells disappeared, and the immune tolerance of maternal cells disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implication is that lifelong tolerance to maternal microchimeric cells is probably dependent on just a tiny subset of maternal cells. Take those away, and immune chaos likely ensues. That also means that immune tolerance needs to be continuously and actively maintained; it's not a one-and-done process during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's interesting and exciting in its own right, but the research also offers a way to gain a greater understanding of the broad swath of diseases and conditions to which microchimerism may contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The new tools we developed to study these cells will help scientists pinpoint exactly what these cells do and how they work in a variety of contexts including autoimmune disease,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="187604" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and neurological disorders," &lt;a href="https://scienceblog.cincinnatichildrens.org/deeper-microchimerism-study-sheds-new-light-on-a-mothers-cellular-gift/"&gt;Way says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microchimerism is increasingly linked with so many health disorders. This study provides an adaptable platform for scientists to investigate whether these rare cells are the cause of disease, or alternatively, found in diseased tissue at increased levels as part of the natural healing process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2025.08.005"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Immunity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Today, we’re talking about food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-19s2qxj"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Your brain is an energy hog. Despite comprising about 2 percent of the average person’s body mass, it consumes roughly 20 percent of the body’s energy. In other words, what you use to fuel yourself matters for brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;So what foods are best for your brain?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4581900/"&gt;nine-year study&lt;/a&gt; of nearly 1,000 older adults, researchers at Rush University in Chicago found that people who ate more of nine particular types of food — berries, leafy greens, other vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, fish, poultry and olive oil — and who ate less red meat, butter and margarine, cheese, sweet treats and fried food had slower cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Based on these findings, the researchers developed the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/31/well/eat/mind-diet-dementia.html"&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Large studies encompassing thousands of people have since shown that following the MIND diet corresponds with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37105521/"&gt;better cognitive functioning&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37133875/"&gt;lower risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-17055-5"&gt;slower disease progression&lt;/a&gt; in people with Alzheimer’s. People benefit from the diet regardless of whether they start it &lt;a href="https://cdn.nutrition.org/article/S2475-2991(25)01953-5/fulltext"&gt;in midlife or late life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Experts think the foods included in the MIND diet are especially good for the brain because they contain certain macro and micronutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Berries and leafy greens, for example, are rich in polyphenols and other antioxidants, said Jennifer Ventrelle, a dietitian at Rush and a co-author of “The Official Mind Diet.” Many of these compounds can cross the blood-brain barrier and help to fight inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which can damage cells and are linked to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Nuts and fatty fishes, like salmon and sardines, contain omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for building the insulating sheaths that surround the nerve fibers that carry information from one brain cell to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Whole grains and beans both contain a hefty dose of fiber, which feeds the good microbes in the gut. Those microbes produce byproducts called short-chain fatty acids that experts think can influence brain health via the gut-brain axis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;You don’t have to revamp your whole diet to get these nutrients. Instead, think about “MIND-ifying” whatever you already tend to eat, said Dr. Joel Salinas, a neurologist at NYU Langone Health and the founder and chief medical officer of the telehealth platform Isaac Health. For instance, add a handful of nuts or berries to your breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Today’s activity will help you MIND-ify your own meals.

It is not clear when the other two children died and no other information about the children is publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="indent-medium"&gt;"These viruses are serious, dangerous, and life-threatening," said Massachusetts Public Health Commissioner Dr. Robbie Goldstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The percent of hospitalizations associated with the flu has spiked in the last couple of weeks — a full month before last year's surge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Hospitalizations during last winter's harsh flu season peaked at 10.5% at the beginning of February. In total, 470 people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Flourish_flourish__XgVxY  flourish-embed" data-src="visualisation/27077245"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;State data shows only about 34% of Massachusetts residents have been vaccinated against the flu so far this year. The vaccination rate was around 45% in the winter of 2022-2023, and has been decreasing in the years since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;On Monday, the state's public health commissioner encouraged residents to get vaccinated if they have not done so already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="indent-medium"&gt;“This is a moment for clarity, urgency, and action,” Goldstein said in a statement. "There is a simple, effective, and available way to address these concerns: vaccines. They can prevent serious illness and hospitalization. And they save lives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Boston Public Health Commissioner Dr. Bisola Ojikutu reminded residents it's not too late to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="indent-medium"&gt;"The flu vaccine actually takes about two weeks after getting the shot to be fully protected," she said. "And that's really the time that it takes your body to fully develop protective antibodies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;In Boston, she noted infection is increasing most rapidly in children. Children under 5 are seeing an 83% jump, and older children are seeing a 217% spike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Beth Israel Lahey Health and &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/health/2026/01/02/mass-general-brigham-strongly-encouraging-masking-for-visitors-respiratory-infections/"&gt;Mass General Brigham&lt;/a&gt; are requiring masks for health care providers.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW HAVEN, Conn — A fungus that grows as yeast, Candida Auris is popping up more in our state and across the nation. Health experts said the fungus can cause severe infections.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest problems with the fungus is that it's multi-drug resistant, which makes infections difficult to treat. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several strains of Candida, but what many medical centers are dealing with right now is a newer form. It was identified in 2009, the first case was found in 2016, and cases have been sharply increasing in recent years, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/candida-auris/tracking-c-auris/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Scott Roberts, the associate medical director for infection prevention at Yale-New Haven Health, said this strain being newer, complicates treatment. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A lot of labs don’t yet have the mechanisms or capability to actually identify it,” said Roberts.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although research and treatment methods are limited, he said the fungus is known to cause outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s been a handful of reports that there have been outbreaks in nursing homes and congregate care settings where a lot of people live in the same setting and there’s a lot of mixing between patients and between patients,” said Roberts.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people at highest risk for infection are those with weakened immune systems, people who use invasive medical devices like catheters or are in long term care facilities. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone infected by the fungus may experience symptoms like fevers, low blood pressure, or a high heart rate. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Roberts said proper hygiene is the best way to prevent spreading the fungus. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“ Hand washing is the biggest thing. So just washing your hands with soap and water is going to kill this. The other thing is disinfecting the environment so if somebody does have it you can disinfect it with bleach is what we recommend," explained Roberts.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wants to make it clear that not everyone who encounters the fungus will become sick or ever show symptoms, but it is certainly something to monitor for high risk patients. If you believe you’re infected, you’re encouraged to contact your primary care physician.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

At least 5,000 people have died this season, including nine children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d751d6" class="body-graf"&gt;For the week ending Dec. 27, the CDC reported that nearly 1 in 10 outpatient visits nationwide — 8.2% — were for flu-like illnesses. That’s the &lt;a href="https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html" target="_blank"&gt;highest logged since the CDC started tracking such visits&lt;/a&gt; in 1997. The flu has accounted for more than 11 million illnesses this season and 120,000 hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ca1016" class="body-graf"&gt;Forty-five states are experiencing high to very high levels of flu activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-edffd1" class="body-graf"&gt;Only Montana, South Dakota, Vermont and West Virginia are experiencing low to moderate flu spread. Data for Nevada was “insufficient,” the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-579063" class="body-graf"&gt;Because the latest data is from the week of Christmas, it doesn’t yet reflect illnesses caused by holiday travel and gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1fee0a" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s still too soon to know what the impact of the holiday season is going to be on flu activity,” said Krista Kniss, an epidemiologist in the CDC’s influenza division. “We’re not anywhere close to being done.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b659ff" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Nick Cozzi, emergency medical services director for Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, said the flu is keeping his team “incredibly busy.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-afe97e" class="body-graf"&gt;“I see a lot of patients coming in with cough, runny nose, shortness of breath, diarrhea and bone-chilling body aches,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2355e0" class="body-graf"&gt;Compounding the problem, many patients are dealing with other viruses, like Covid or &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rsv-dangerous-babies-not-others-rcna56551" target="_blank"&gt;RSV&lt;/a&gt;, on top of flu, Cozzi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4666ac" class="body-graf"&gt;A significant number of patients, he said, are also having trouble breathing. “We’re admitting patients at a higher rate than we normally do,” he said. “Their oxygen levels are lower than normal, creating a potential situation which can be life-threatening unless they receive supplemental oxygen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-60acb3" class="body-graf"&gt;At Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, flu hospitalizations more than doubled in the last two weeks compared with the previous two-week period, said Dr. Emily Boss, director of pediatric otolaryngology at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b8c66c" class="body-graf"&gt;“This rise is earlier than last year by about a month,” Boss said. “We don’t know yet what the peak will look like compared to prior seasons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-5962c9" class="body-heading"&gt;HHS no longer recommends flu shots for all kids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-37c63c" class="body-graf"&gt;The 2025-26 flu season, which is just getting started, follows the deadliest season for children since the CDC began tracking pediatric deaths. On Monday, the CDC reported an additional death of a child last season, bringing the total to 289, eclipsing even the number of pediatric deaths from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5ba2a7" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s too soon to know how harsh this season will be for children, although under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s guidance, the U.S. is no longer recommending that all children get annual flu shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-70e00a" class="body-graf"&gt;On Monday, the Department of Health and Human Services announced a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-vaccines-overhaul-kids-denmark-fewer-childhood-shots-rcna250055" target="_blank"&gt;major overhaul of the childhood vaccination schedule&lt;/a&gt;. Effective immediately, the administration said, the flu vaccine will be taken off of the official childhood vaccine schedule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8082f0" class="body-graf"&gt;“To back off on a flu recommendation in the midst of a pretty severe flu year seems to me to be pretty tone-deaf,” Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ committee on infectious diseases, said on a call with reporters. “And that’s coming off an influenza year where we had the most childhood deaths from influenza in many years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-423612" class="body-graf"&gt;As of Monday afternoon, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC’s website&lt;/a&gt; still stated: “Everyone 6 months and older, with rare exceptions, should get a flu vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 23:07:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxNQUd4cmcySHFQYi16R1VyRk51N2lFV0FQX0QtbFJpb1I3b2k1U3IyMGxtM0Y3VnQyTzFEXzdoT21JWkFiZk9FMTNKM1VvSHlheFVkR0Y1NzFpSXhaTzhoU2NDS2FWWEt6STduV29LejBMNjBvemhRckhsOTRKVEtoSTBNVDlGNGs0a0l2bmt3Y0hBcW00bVktWEowbVJoOXfSAVZBVV95cUxOa05oeUozRHBkRFlBMmNVbnhwWmc2N1g5WHhVUS1rdElWcXNkcjloUTFOSlhnMTJlaURYMzl4am82YS1weTVEc1dDRV9MV1JVUDdqUGdXdw</guid></item><item><title>Andrew Huberman正在优化土耳其辣椒-切割</title><link>https://www.thecut.com/article/andrew-huberman-goop-turkey-chili.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wwwthecut-zephr-anchor" class="article-content inline" data-editable="content"&gt;

Luckily, Goop Kitchen is here to help. To kick off the New Year, Gwyneth Paltrow’s &lt;a href="https://www.goopkitchen.com/our-mission"&gt;seed-oil-free food-delivery service&lt;/a&gt; is teaming up with Andrew Huberman to launch a groundbreaking dish packed with &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/fiber-life-changing-jeni-britton-floura-interview.html"&gt;everyone’s favorite macros&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.goopkitchen.com/winter-menu/hubermans-organic-turkey-chili"&gt;turkey chili&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmk1rk8gn00153b7bd4p2fpjh@published" data-word-count="162"&gt;Huberman — the Stanford University professor of neurology and ophthalmology &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/andrew-huberman-podcast-stanford-joe-rogan.html"&gt;turned longevity podcaster&lt;/a&gt; — has been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/27/business/david-protein-bars.html"&gt;one of the loudest voices&lt;/a&gt; convincing Americans they need to eat way more protein. While many &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/25/well/eat/protein-meal-guide.html"&gt;nutrition experts dispute this&lt;/a&gt;, Paltrow has been “praying” for him to do a collaboration. So what’s in Huberman’s “&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTIo2ZVj9aK/?hl=en"&gt;brain-supporting spin on chili&lt;/a&gt;”? It appears to be organic turkey, kidney beans, and a blend of spices. Not the most innovative recipe, but apparently the magic is in the proportions. “The meat-to-bean ratio in chili is crucial,” Huberman reflects in &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTIo2ZVj9aK/?hl=en"&gt;the promo video&lt;/a&gt; — you want enough to add some fiber but not so much that it’s “overly starchy,” Paltrow explains. Huberman adds that in the winter, he likes to eat hot foods. If you’re not sold yet, he also &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/andrew-huberman-diet-advice"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;GQ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that, in his opinion, “the turkey chili doesn’t taste like turkey. It tastes a bit more like beef to me.” He likes to garnish his with pickled onions to support his microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;

But before you click “order,” it may be worth considering that Huberman &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20"&gt;once said on his podcast&lt;/a&gt; that he “doesn’t go anywhere near the food production” in his home “for everyone’s benefit.” Then again, that’s what New Year’s resolutions are for, right?&lt;/p&gt;

Goldman, MD, president of the American College of Physicians. “The evidence is clear that vaccines prevent deaths, hospitalizations, and spread of disease.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New schedule recommends shots against 11 diseases, down from 17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The CDC will continue to recommend vaccines against 11 diseases for all children, including measles, mumps, rubella, polio, pertussis, tetanus, diphtheria, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; type B (Hib), pneumococcal disease, human papillomavirus (HPV), and varicella (chickenpox).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The CDC is recommending six shots for “high-risk groups,” including vaccines that protect against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, dengue and two vaccines targeting bacterial meningitis (MenACWY and MenB). Dengue vaccines have always been targeted only to a relatively small number of children in specific circumstances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The vaccines recommended for shared clinical decision-making are for rotavirus, COVID-19, influenza, meningococcal disease, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In another important change, the CDC is now recommending only one dose of HPV vaccine. Until today, the CDC recommended two or three HPV vaccines, depending on the age at which children receive their first shot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The new policy emphasizes that all vaccines recommended for any of the three categories will remain covered by insurance. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long claimed that US children receive “too many” vaccines. Today’s announcement addresses his long-held wish to reduce the number of immunizations that children receive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It also fulfills a directive issued by President Donald Trump last month calling for HHS to align the US vaccination schedule with that of Denmark and other countries that recommend fewer vaccines. The CDC said the changes followed an assessment of 20 developed nations, most of which have national health care systems that provide free health care to their citizens from birth to death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experts say changes are radical, dangerous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This is a very dark day for children and for their parents and for our country generally,” said Jesse Goodman, MD, MPH, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Georgetown University, who spoke at a press conference of vaccine experts following the announcement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Goodman compared the announcement to a “torpedo” blowing up vaccination policy. “There will be more diseases, more infection, more hospitalization,” said Goodman, a former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) chief scientist and former director of the agency’s center for biologics evaluation and research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Officials with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), which has not changed its childhood vaccination recommendations, also oppose the new schedule. Many pediatricians and family doctors tell CIDRAP News that they will continue to follow AAP’s guidance, rather than that of the CDC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a very dark day for children and for their parents and for our country generally....There will be more diseases, more infection, more hospitalization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’m not sure why they want to bring the diseases back but that’s their goal,” said Sean O’ Leary, MD, who chairs the AAP’s infectious disease committee, during a separate press conference held after the announcement. “With RSV we’ve already seen population-level impact. Why do they want more hospitalizations? Hepatitis A is a miserable disease, and it’s particularly bad as children age.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael Osterholm, MPH, PhD, of the Vaccine Integrity Project and the director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), which publishes CIDRAP News, called today’s announcement a radical move. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Eliminating vital US childhood vaccine recommendations without public discussion or transparent review of the data the decision was based on is a radical and dangerous decision,” Osterholm said. “This wildly irresponsible decision will put lives at risk.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eying a return of vaccine-preventable diseases&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The changes to the childhood immunization schedule come as more US children are dying from vaccine-preventable diseases, which have returned as immunization rates have declined.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two Texas children died from measles last year in an outbreak that has reached more than 2,000 cases and shows no sign of stopping. Thirteen people &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/whooping-cough-deaths-rise-in-u-s-as-surge-in-infections-continues/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;died from pertussis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, also known as whooping cough, which infected nearly 28,000 Americans last year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The United States also &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-general/cdc-reports-highlight-2024-25-flu-seasons-deadly-impact-us-kids#:~:text=Two%20new%20reports%20this%20week,a%20high%2Dseverity%20flu%20season."&gt;&lt;span&gt;recorded at least 288 flu deaths &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;in children last year, the highest number for a non-pandemic flu season. Several children already have died of flu this year, in what is predicted to be a severe influenza season.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Given the intensity of the current flu season and this guidance from the political appointees at HHS, it seems likely we will see even more deaths this year,” Kevin Ault, MD, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Western Michigan University Homer Stryker School of Medicine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Making these changes amid ongoing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases shows a disregard for the real confusion families already face,” Infectious Diseases Society of America President Ronald Nahass, MD, said in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2026/idsa-statement-on-childhood-vaccine-schedule/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;During the AAP press conference, O’Leary said the emphasis on shared clinical decision-making will only further confuse both parents and doctors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The fact is, pediatricians already do this all day, every day,” he said. “It just makes things more confusing for parents and clinicians. So when the evidence is clear that the benefits outweigh the risks, the guidance should be clear, not confusing as what has now happened today.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes likely to be challenged in court&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Trump administration has circumvented the usual process for updating vaccine schedules, which normally involves input from scientific experts, public health leaders, and other stakeholders, Ault said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;An 80-year-old law called the Administrative Procedures Act &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/nearly-80-year-old-law-could-hamper-rfk-jr-s-drive-remake-vaccine-schedule"&gt;&lt;span&gt;requires that federal officials follow an open, deliberative process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; when issuing rules and regulations. The law forbids federal officials from making decisions that are “arbitrary and capricious.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The AAP already &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/medical-groups-sue-hhs-kennedy-over-covid-vaccine-policy-changes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;filed a lawsuit against Kennedy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in July, claiming that he violated the APA when he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://litigationtracker.law.georgetown.edu/litigation/american-academy-of-pediatrics-et-al-v-robert-f-kennedy-jr-et-al/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;issued a directive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; removing the COVID-19 vaccine from the CDC immunization schedule for children and pregnant women. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eliminating vital US childhood vaccine recommendations without public discussion or transparent review of the data the decision was based on is a radical and dangerous decision.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;For vaccines, that process typically includes public meetings by ACIP, which makes vaccine recommendations which the CDC director can accept or reject. These meetings are announced in advance, with opportunity for written comments ahead of the meeting, as well as time for the public to speak during the meeting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“For decades, changes in the American vaccine have been discussed in public meetings at the CDC with expert review of the available evidence,” said Ault, a former member of ACIP. “The new guidelines are not supported by data, and there was no input from stakeholder groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians.”  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Default"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The goal of this administration is to make vaccines optional,” said Paul Offit, MD, an infectious disease specialist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “I think that’s where we’ve been moving.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The device detects and amplifies brain waves, and neurological activity appears as wavy lines on the EEG recording. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Approximately 20 minutes into the test, however, the patient unexpectedly suffered cardiac arrest and died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ongoing EEG captured what Zemmar later realized was the first-ever recording of a naturally occurring human death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The surgeon's discovery has made him rethink what he knows about death&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ajmal Zemmar and his team captured the first-ever recording of a dying human brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it recorded 900 seconds of the event, from before and after the main died, the most striking finding occurred 30 to 60 seconds after the man's heart stopped beating: the brain continued to produce gamma waves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gamma brainwaves are the fastest frequencies associated with peak mental performance, including intense focus, heightened awareness, learning, memory and integrating complex information. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zemmar, now based in&lt;span&gt; Louisville, &lt;/span&gt;Kentucky&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;explained that gamma waves are the same high-frequency brain oscillations also observed when living people recall or view highly memorable life events, such as the birth of a child, a wedding or a graduation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We need to rethink death,' said Zemmar, adding that we can find comfort in knowing that when a loved one dies, they are no longer in pain, but instead revisiting meaningful moments from their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zemmar also stressed that producing gamma waves requires high-level brain activity, not something that occurs accidentally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It suggests that there's some coordinated activity going on,' he noted, adding that the discovery was a 'paradigm shift' from the Hollywood depiction of instant brain silence when the heart stops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The newly discovered pattern, according to Zemmar, also provided the first neurophysiological evidence supporting reports from approximately 14,000 near-death experience survivors who consistently describe a life flashback during clinical death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Until this recording, no scientific mechanism had explained those accounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While it recorded 900 seconds of the event, from before and after the main died, the most striking finding occurred 30 to 60 seconds after the man's heart stopped beating: the brain continued to produce gamma waves&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although initially cautious because the finding came from a single case, Zemmar said two additional human cases identified by a separate research group at the University of Michigan have since confirmed the same gamma-wave surge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2023, Michigan researchers found that two patients who were thought to be brain-dead experienced sudden bursts of brain activity after being taken off life support, the same gamma waves as Zemmar had observed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There are three cases in humans now,' Zemmar said. 'It's not a lot, but it's something, better than none.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also suggested that the brain could be biologically programmed to manage the transition into death, potentially orchestrating a series of physiological and neurological events rather than simply shutting off instantly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zemmar, who once adhered strictly to provable science, now believes reducing uncertainty around death can comfort both the dying and the bereaved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drawing on teachings from Vietnamese Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh about the 'seven bodies,' he noted that only the physical body departs at death, while other dimensions - emotional influence, inspiration and guidance - remain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The person who leaves us doesn't stop interacting and influencing us,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultimately, Zemmar hopes the research helps humanity confront an inevitable experience with less fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Death affects every human,' he concluded. 'If we reimagine the way that death looks like and we try to find our comfort and our peace with that, I think those things may help humans to think about death in a different way.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A common theory suggests that you don't need to wash your sheets as frequently in the winter. There is certainly a logical explanation for this idea: colder weather might suggest less sweating at night and, therefore, less urgency to wash your sheets. However, according to industry experts, this idea is wholly inaccurate.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some sources suggest you can wash your sheets less frequently in the winter, based on the idea that people sweat less in the colder months. But laundry experts say this is only a myth. You should &lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-often-should-you-wash-sheets-11733618" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;wash your sheets just as often in winter as you do the rest of the year&lt;/a&gt;: every one to two weeks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block u-no-article-width-restriction"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "The 'wash less in winter' myth comes from people thinking they sweat less, but you're actually shedding dead skin cells at the same rate year-round," says Matt O'Connor, the co-founder and CEO at NoScrubs.com.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block u-no-article-width-restriction"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, thanks to more time spent indoors with closed windows, your bedding is likely harboring even more body oils, skin cells, and potential allergens than in other seasons.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Indoors in winter is a playground for allergens and irritants, especially dust mites and pet dander," says Tom Ceconi, president at Heritage Park Laundry. "If you do perspire, the warm, damp conditions are ideal for trapping musty smells and even growing mold."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "You should generally wash your sheets every two weeks throughout the year to keep them feeling fresh," Lewenhaupt says. "This remains true in the winter."

&lt;ol id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose the right detergent.&lt;/strong&gt; "One of the biggest problems we face in the winter is dry skin that is prone to irritation," says Ceconi, who recommends avoiding any detergent or product that contains dyes, synthetic fragrances, or harsh chemicals. You might also consider a hypoallergenic detergent to help minimize issues from dry skin and allergens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-temperature-water-for-sheets-11704771" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;right water temperature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; for your chosen detergent.&lt;/strong&gt; If you opt for a high-quality detergent, a cool or warm temperature is likely sufficient for washing your sheets. Otherwise, our experts recommend using half the detergent you think you need, paired with hot water (at least 130°F) to kill bacteria and dust mites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/top-uses-for-vinegar-in-laundry-2147286" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add white vinegar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to the rinse cycle.&lt;/strong&gt; Since many of us experience dry skin in the winter, this extra step can help reduce irritation from detergent-coated fabrics and dry skin. "It strips out detergent buildup better than fabric softener and won't leave that waxy coating that traps oils," says O'Connor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry thoroughly with a warm temperature and wool dryer balls.&lt;/strong&gt; Lewenhaupt suggests air drying whenever possible, but this can be challenging in winter, when temperatures are lower. Instead, &lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-wool-dryer-balls-4781065" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;add a set of wool dryer balls&lt;/a&gt; to your dryer. "Tumble dryer balls increase air circulation, which shortens drying time and reduces static buildup," says Lewenhaupt. "Be mindful of using too high a heat, as that can cause shrinkage and damage the fabric."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block u-no-article-width-restriction"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always &lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/international-laundry-care-symbols-2146487" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;check the care label&lt;/a&gt; on your sheets and other bedding to ensure you use the correct washing and drying methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporate a vinegar rinse into your winter washing routine to reduce detergent buildup and minimize skin irritation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use wool dryer balls instead of fabric softeners or dryer sheets. This method will remove detergent buildup, avoid unnecessary chemicals, and speed up the drying time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never use bleach, as it can agitate your skin and damage your sheets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/shake-method-for-laundry-8786710" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Shake your sheets well&lt;/a&gt; after the wash cycle to speed up drying time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever possible, skip the dryer and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-line-dry-clothes-indoors-1387951" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;air-dry&lt;/a&gt; your sheets instead. O'Connor recommends hanging them indoors near a heat vent or radiator (of course, abide by fire safety rules). Meanwhile, Ceconi suggests hanging them on a clothesline on a cold, sunny day (under a porch).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lewenhaupt recommends using a steamer in between or after washes to remove wrinkles, surface dirt, and bacteria.&lt;/li&gt;

As a paramedic, he’d seen the disastrous effects of other drugs and alcohol so, after years of fighting fires for the U.S Forest Service, he began to smoke marijuana to dull the pain from scoliosis and his torn-up knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He became more interested in the plant’s potential benefits after seeing family members suffer from cancer and opioid abuse. Panks and his wife founded &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/homegrownorx"&gt;HomeGrown ORegonicX&lt;/a&gt;, a small medical cannabis farm that serves the deaf community in Oregon, and started smoking pot frequently every day to test different strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was shocked in 2013 when he was struck by vicious bouts of vomiting. He would start vomiting in the morning and continue the rest of the day non-stop, sometimes for days at a time. He couldn’t eat or keep down fluids. Only a hot shower would offer some relief. The condition would fade, then reemerge after two or three months, often at times of stress..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panks lost 50 pounds as his body seemed to be trying to purge something. His abdomen and back ached from constant dry heaves. His throat was burned by the stomach acids, and a dentist told him his teeth were ruined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a doctor gave him his diagnosis, he initially refused to believe it: cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, or CHS. While Panks doesn’t scream from it, other people affected sometimes cry out in pain, leading to its other name: scromiting, for the combination of screaming and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes it goes 14 days, where my whole body starts to seize up,” Panks said. “I have to go to the ER and get fluids. It can be very, very brutal. You’re sliding down the stairs because you don’t have the strength to stand up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition is rare and the mechanism of its cause unexplained, prompting some cannabis advocates to refuse to believe it. But Panks is far from alone. A new study of hospital emergency departments nationwide by the University of Illinois Chicago found the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2841769?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=112425"&gt;number of diagnosed cases of CHS jumped sevenfold&lt;/a&gt; from 2016 to 2022.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase came at the same time as increased cannabis legalization and potency, and peaked at 33 cases per 100,000 ER visits during the COVID pandemic, when substance abuse increased sharply. The increase came primarily among young adults, 18 to 35, most of them men.				&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people with CHS are long-term users who smoke every day, often high potency weed or concentrates, research shows. Seventy-five percent of people diagnosed with CHS &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5330965/"&gt;consumed cannabis every day&lt;/a&gt;, a systematic review found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, cannabis is well-known for its ability improve appetite. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved synthetic THC for the treatment of nausea from conditions such as chemotherapy, though many patients prefer flowers from the plant itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like any drug, what can have mild effects in moderation may have toxic effects from over-consumption. It is known that cannabis acts on the endo-cannabinoid system, which helps regulate the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lead author of the UIC study, professor James Swartz, said he believes the increase in state legalization and higher potency were the main factors at work behind the increase. He hopes the study will encourage clinicians to consider CHS when treating patients.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;“There is still some skepticism,” Swartz said. “Proponents of cannabis say this is being alarmist, it hardly occurs. No, this is real, and it’s common enough that it’s of concern.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People should consider the condition when considering how much to use and what’s safe, and take “a long hard look” at very high potency products, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swartz has some unlikely allies in the cannabis world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Blake, founder of The Emerald Cup, the Oscars of the cannabis world, said he ran into a wall with hyperemesis years ago and had to cut way back on his consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blake is 68 and has been smoking since he was 14, with a few periods of abstinence. He has grown cannabis and used it to deal with three rounds of metastatic cancer, so he is an enthusiastic advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a little more than 10 years ago, he got very sick with cyclic vomiting. It only went away after he quit smoking for several months to eliminate the buildup of THC, the main component of pot that gets users high, and which accumulates in the body’s fatty tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, like drinkers who abstain from alcohol for “Dry January,” he starts every year by abstaining from cannabis for a month or two to clean out his system. When he stopped smoking, he would sweat profusely for five days to clean out his system. He stopped using concentrates, but still vapes once a day or so, and meditates daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He decries the high THC dabs and concentrates that have transformed the use of marijuana for some, and advocates a more moderate approach to consumption, comparing weed to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We shouldn’t be drinking 151 rum shots every day,” he said. “We should do more beer and wine. It is a real issue we want to address so people can safely and effectively use cannabis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panks, who with his wife started Deafining Cannabis to develop sign language related to the plant, said that instead of focusing on high THC, users should look more into the effects of cannabis terpenes, the compounds that help give cannabis and other plants their distinctive effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need to stop looking at THC percentages and more at the terpenes, so you can understand how your body reacts,” he said. “I hope to be part of a study that can further define the mechanism of CHS and a documentary on the process so that we all can have a better understanding of the science behind it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHS research remains in its infancy, but may be enhanced by recent federal efforts to reclassify cannabis as a less dangerous drug. The World Health Organization only recently recognized CHS as a medical condition. Everyone affected by CHS wants more research to explain its causes, cures, the potential roles of neem oil and other pesticides, and why it affects some people and not others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, abstinence remains the only known cure for CHS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prominent &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/javierhasse/2020/03/13/alice-moon-chs/"&gt;cannabis advocate Alice Moon&lt;/a&gt; said she wants more research so maybe she can use cannabis again someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I promote a substance I cannot consume,” she said. “I’m adamant about spreading awareness, because I don’t want anybody to be as sick as I was.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;As New Year’s resolutions kick into high gear, many are looking to lose weight with drugs like Ozempic and other GLP-1 medications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bariatric surgeon Dr. Katelin Mirkin is among the medical doctors who warn that these medications are not without risk, and relying on them for a quick fix to weight loss could come with significant consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ve noticed a lot of really impressive rebound weight gain after these drugs are stopped, particularly when they’re stopped abruptly,” Mirkin said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Medications like Wegovy and Ozempic were originally designed to treat diabetes, but they’ve become increasingly popular among people using them for weight loss. As more and more Americans turn to GLP-1s, doctors are learning more about what happens when patients discontinue use of the drugs, including weight regain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many people tolerate GLP-1 drugs well, but like any medication, they carry side effects. The most common include nausea, vomiting, constipation and slowed digestion. These effects occur because the drugs are working as intended by slowing gastrointestinal transit and suppressing appetite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are also concerns for more serious problems like pancreatitis, gallbladder disease, sarcopenia, which is a fancy word for muscle loss … and some rare thyroid cancer risks,” Mirkin said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, Mirkin said the medications are “pretty well tolerated” by most patients. But studies suggest that most people stop taking these drugs within a year and many quickly regain weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That negative feedback of that nausea that you felt from the medication isn’t there, and so you just kind of go back into old habits,” Mirkin said. “The drugs themselves slow how your GI system processes food, and so once that’s gone, you’re not going to feel a lot of those side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly why the weight returns after stopping GLP-1s is still being studied. Experts have said it’s likely a combination of factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I see patients that describe voracious hunger and appetite after stopping these medications. Or they try them for a while, have some success, but then can’t afford the financial burden of them or can’t tolerate the side effects,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctors agree that for many patients, especially those who are obese or have diabetes, GLP-1 drugs may need to be taken indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mirkin said the medications shouldn’t be considered a jump-start to lose weight or a quick fix that can be applied in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While patients are advised to pair the drugs with lifestyle changes like increased protein intake, strength training and mindful eating, some rely solely on the medication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Some of these weight regains is even in people that have made these lifestyle changes,” Mirkin said. “But certainly your overall health is going to be better if you can kind of commit to healthier habits in general.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Three children have died from the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flu-season-spike-new-cdc-data/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Massachusetts so far this season, the Department of Public Health said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deaths occurred in recent weeks as peak flu season gets underway. The department said it could not provide information about the patients' ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These viruses are serious, dangerous, and life-threatening. We are seeing children who are seriously ill, families grieving devastating losses, and hospitals under capacity strain," Public Health Commissioner Dr. Robbie Goldstein said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Would not be surprising to see more"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 10 pediatric flu deaths in the 2024-2025 season, the department said - a record-high. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's early in the season yet and it would not be surprising to see more, sadly," said Dr. Larry Madoff, the medical director of the department's bureau of infectious disease and laboratory sciences. "It's shaping up to be a severe early flu season."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Madoff said children under the age of 2 are most at risk of dying from the flu, but doctors are also seeing severe cases in children as old as 5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kids do get quite ill with the flu, they also spread it to their classmates and to their parents and family at home," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu activity is now "very high" in the state for the first time this season. Nine percent of all hospitalizations in the state are associated with the flu, compared to 5% the previous week.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been 29 adult deaths from the flu this season. The state is also investigating two possible COVID-associated deaths and one RSV-associated death in patients under 18 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Flu vaccination push&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials are stressing that it's not too late to get a flu or COVID vaccine. Flu and COVID vaccination rates in Massachusetts have been &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/flu-covid-vaccination-rate-massachusetts/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;"really lagging"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; this year," Dr. Madoff said, with just 1 out of every 9 residents vaccinated against COVID and 1 in 3 vaccinated against flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These deaths underscore the need for kids to be vaccinated," Dr. Madoff said. "Everyone should get a flu vaccine, everyone over the age of 6 months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials in the city of Boston warned in late December that it was seeing a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/flu-season-massachusetts-vaccine/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;114% increase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in flu cases. The biggest jump in cases was reported among children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boston is holding free flu and COVID vaccine clinics for children 6 months and older in January. &lt;a href="https://www.boston.gov/government/cabinets/boston-public-health-commission/free-vaccine-clinics-boston" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We spend a third of our lives asleep. And a quarter of our time asleep is spent dreaming. So, for the average person alive in 2022, with a life expectancy of around &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/ghe-life-expectancy-and-healthy-life-expectancy"&gt;73&lt;/a&gt;, that clocks in at just over six years of dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, given the central role that dreaming plays in our lives, we still know so little about why we dream, how the brain creates dreams, and importantly, what the significance of our dreams might be for our health – especially the health of our brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My 2022 study, published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet's&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00370-4/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/em&gt; journal&lt;/a&gt;, showed that our dreams can reveal a surprising amount of information about our brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-roots-of-dementia-trace-back-all-the-way-to-childhood-experts-find"&gt;The Roots of Dementia Trace Back All The Way to Childhood, Experts Find&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, it showed that having frequent bad dreams and nightmares (bad dreams that make you wake up) during middle or older age, may be linked with an increased risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dementia/symptoms/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143068" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands.jpg" alt="man in bed surrounded by hands" class="wp-image-143068 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands-600x325.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143068" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Frequent nightmares could be a sign of declining mental health. (Kirk Marsh/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, I analyzed data from three large US studies of health and aging. These included over 600 people aged between 35 and 64, and 2,600 people aged 79 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the participants were dementia-free at the start of the study and were followed for an average of nine years for the middle-aged group and five years for the older participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the study (2002-12), the participants completed a range of questionnaires, including one that asked about how often they experienced bad dreams and nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I analyzed the data to find out whether participants with a higher frequency of nightmares at the beginning of the study were more likely to go on to experience cognitive decline (a fast decline in memory and thinking skills over time) and be diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weekly nightmares&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found that middle-aged participants who experienced nightmares every week were four times more likely to experience cognitive decline (&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12704"&gt;a precursor to dementia)&lt;/a&gt; over the following decade, while the older participants were twice as likely to be diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the connection between nightmares and future dementia was much stronger for men than for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, older men who had nightmares every week were five times more likely to develop dementia compared with older men reporting no bad dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In women, however, the increase in risk was only 41 percent. I found a very similar pattern in the middle-aged group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these results suggest frequent nightmares may be one of the earliest signs of dementia, which can precede the development of memory and thinking problems by several years or even decades – especially in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, it is also possible that having regular bad dreams and nightmares might even be a cause of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-6-key-depression-symptoms-that-predict-dementia-risk"&gt;Scientists Identify 6 Key Depression Symptoms That Predict Dementia Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the nature of this study, it is not possible to be certain which of these theories is correct (though I suspect it is the former).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, regardless of which theory turns out to be true – the major implication of the study remains the same, that is, that having regular bad dreams and nightmares during middle and older age may be linked to an increased risk of developing dementia later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that recurring nightmares are &lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.7178"&gt;treatable&lt;/a&gt;.

                    &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. flu infections surged over the holidays, and health officials are calling it a severe season that is likely to get worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New government data posted Monday — for flu activity through the week of Christmas — showed that by some measures this season is already surpassing the flu epidemic of last winter, one of the harshest in recent history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data was released the same day that the Trump administration said it will no longer recommend flu shots and some other types of vaccines for all children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-the-flu-season-is-so-bad-and-how-you-can-protect-yourself"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; Why the flu season is so bad and how you can protect yourself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty-five states were reporting high or very high flu activity during the week of Christmas, up from 30 states the week before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The higher numbers appear to be driven by the type of flu that's been spreading, public health experts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One type of flu virus, called A H3N2, historically has caused the most hospitalizations and deaths in older people. So far this season, that's the type most frequently reported. Even more concerning, more than 90% of the H3N2 infections analyzed were a new version — known as the subclade K variant — that differs from the strain in this year's flu shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flu seasons often don't peak until January or February, so it's too early to know how big a problem that mismatch will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-vaccine-hesitancy-may-be-driving-a-spike-in-pediatric-flu-deaths"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; How vaccine hesitancy may be driving a spike in pediatric flu deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The fact that we've seen steady increases over the last several weeks without much of a decline or even a flattening would suggest to me that we've got the peak ahead of us," said Dr. Robert Hopkins, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The second bad flu season in a row&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last flu season was bad, with the overall flu hospitalization rate the highest since the H1N1 flu pandemic 15 years ago. Child flu deaths reached 288, the worst recorded for regular U.S. flu season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine pediatric flu deaths have been reported so far this season. For children, the percentage of emergency department visits due to flu has already surpassed the highest mark seen during the 2024-2025 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopkins said H3N2 typically hits older adults hardest, and rising rates among children and young adults suggest a severe flu season across all age groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/trump-administration-cuts-number-of-vaccines-it-recommends-for-every-child"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Trump administration cuts number of vaccines it recommends for every child&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another ominous sign: The percentage of doctor's office and medical clinic visits that were due to flu-like illness also was higher late last month than at any point during the previous flu season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deaths and hospitalizations have not reached last year's levels, but those are lagging indicators, Hopkins noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates at least 11 million illnesses, 120,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths from flu have already occurred this season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. government dials back vaccine recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health experts recommend that everyone 6 months and older get an annual influenza vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But federal health officials on Monday announced they will no longer recommend flu vaccinations for U.S. children, saying it's a decision parents and patients should make in consultation with their doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, flu vaccine will continue to be fully covered by private insurers and federal programs, including Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Vaccines for Children program, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 infections also have been rising, other federal data show, though so far this winter they remain less common than flu. The Trump administration stopped recommending COVID-19 shots for healthy children last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. will stop collecting Medicaid data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopkins voiced concern about a federal notice posted last week that said government Medicaid programs, which pay for medical services for low-income families, will no longer have to report on immunization rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC survey data suggests that U.S. flu vaccination rates are about the same as last year. But the Medicaid data — for flu as well as measles and other bugs — is a more comprehensive look at children who are at higher risk for many diseases, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal health officials framed the move as part of an effort to distance how Medicaid doctors are rated and paid from how often they provided childhood vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Government bureaucracies should never coerce doctors or families into accepting vaccines or penalize physicians for respecting patient choice," wrote Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was a leading voice in the anti-vaccine community before President Donald Trump put him in charge of federal health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That practice ends now," Kennedy wrote on social media last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Hopkins said the move will "eliminate a major source of data" that allows communities to assess efforts to protect children from vaccine-preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a disastrous plan," he added.&lt;/p&gt;

Wittmann at &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Microsoft Research&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He works as a senior applied scientist, focusing on tools that make DNA screening more reliable for laboratories and synthesis companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These projects rely on genome-language models, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/people-are-falling-in-love-with-ai-companions-and-it-could-be-dangerous/"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; tools that guess plausible stretches of DNA in a sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once trained on thousands of sequences, those models can suggest entirely new genomes that still resemble natural viral families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That creative reach makes it harder for experts to anticipate how a machine-designed virus or protein might behave in real experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent preprint, researchers used those models to design hundreds of candidate phage genomes and successfully grew 16 working viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because each phage infects only specific bacteria, doctors hope tailored cocktails can treat stubborn infections while sparing helpful microbes and human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30763536/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; describe patients with antibiotic-resistant infections who improved after receiving experimental phage therapy when standard drugs had failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dual-use-dilemma"&gt;Dual-use dilemma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists use the term dual-use research, work that can help or harm depending on intent, to describe such powerful technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same algorithm that optimizes drug droplets for asthma inhalers could also reveal recipes for more efficient aerosolized chemical or biological attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The models are considered capable, particularly when tested on real-world health data rather than controlled examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers argue that carefully limiting which &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/missing-parts-of-the-human-genome-have-finally-been-decoded/"&gt;genomes&lt;/a&gt; and toxins appear in training data is an essential first safety barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-ai-viruses-evade-screenings"&gt;How AI viruses evade screenings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many DNA synthesis firms screen nucleic acids, genetic molecules that carry hereditary information, and flag customer orders that match pathogens or toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wittmann’s team showed that advanced protein design tools can rewrite dangerous proteins into new sequences that still work yet evade standard screening filters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with several &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/oldest-human-genome-reveals-lrj-group-lived-europe-80-generation-then-vanished/"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; suppliers, they developed new algorithms that focus on protein structure and function, sharply improving detection of these disguised sequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-better-defenses"&gt;Building better defenses&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those patches are now being integrated into commercial screening pipelines, transforming a hidden weakness into a playbook for defending against AI-assisted design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective DNA synthesis screening, automated checks on gene orders and customers, gives authorities a chance to stop dangerous projects before material is produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Biosecurity and Biosafety Initiative for Science &lt;a href="https://ibbis.bio/our-work/international-screening-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;promotes&lt;/a&gt; screening standards so companies and regulators judge genetic orders with similar criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-federal-policies-for-safety"&gt;Federal policies for safety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal &lt;a href="https://genesynthesisscreening.centerforhealthsecurity.org/key-policies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;framework&lt;/a&gt; links research funding to nucleic-acid screening, encouraging agencies to favor labs that buy DNA from vetted providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under this policy, providers are expected to screen every order, assess customers, report suspicious requests, and keep records for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future administrations may revise or replace these expectations, but they demonstrate how governments can turn safety guidance into concrete purchasing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar requirements could eventually apply to high capability AI developers, tying access to public contracts to documented testing and clear internal safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-global-efforts-for-safety-standards"&gt;Global efforts for safety standards&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Biosecurity and Biosafety Initiative for Science brings together companies and regulators to update screening norms as AI and synthesis technologies change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One important partner is the International Gene Synthesis Consortium, whose members commit to screening sequences and customer identities using a harmonized protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom has created an &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-institute-overview/introducing-the-ai-safety-institute" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AI-Safety institute&lt;/a&gt; to test models, evaluate risks, and share methods for reducing misuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tessa Alexanian, a researcher involved in the study, described the approach as deliberately flexible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This managed-access program is an experiment and we’re very eager to evolve our approach,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-practical-limits-to-bioweapons"&gt;Practical limits to bioweapons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all the worry, there remains a wide gap between digital genome design and reliably engineering contagious viruses that can spread among humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent phage work targeted tiny bacterial viruses, far simpler than the complex pathogens responsible for diseases such as influenza or COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with good designs, scientists still need high-containment facilities, careful oversight, and months or years of experimentation to produce stable, predictable organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts worry because advances in automation, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/herpes-virus-reshapes-human-dna-to-multiply/"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; synthesis, and modeling are shrinking these obstacles, lowering the effort required to attempt dangerous projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-viruses-and-the-future"&gt;AI viruses and the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;More researchers now argue for biosecurity, policies that prevent misuse of biological tools, combining better training choices with simple screening of outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some proposals look further downstream, suggesting environmental surveillance that monitors sewage, air filters, or hospital samples for genetic traces of unauthorized production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, these &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/voters-can-be-rapidly-swayed-by-ai-chatbots/"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; tools could accelerate discovery of antibiotics, vaccines, and tailored phage therapies that rescue patients when drugs fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many experts see a shared responsibility for funders, journals, companies, and universities to require safety evaluations whenever powerful AI tools touch biological work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu8578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

And believe it or not, we've actually seen some patients die from influenza."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Across the country, there have been nine pediatric deaths due to influenza this season, IDPH said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;IDPH said, during the 2024-2025 season, Illinois reported 12 pediatric deaths from influenza, six from RSV and three from COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In Cook County, the percentage of emergency room visits due to influenza has surpassed the peak of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;And the number of flu-related intensive care unit admissions is double what it was last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This is usually the normal pattern of when we get flu, but it is obviously concerning this year just because of the high numbers that we're getting this time of year," said Dr. Trevor Lewis, Cook County Health assistant chair of Emergency Medicine. "It probably started the middle part of December. And with the holidays, lots of people gathering with family and friends, and kids going back to school, it's really spiked these last two weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/flu-like-illness-activity-now-highest-rate-record-linked-new-subclade-variant-cdc-data-shows/18356557/"&gt;Flu activity&lt;/a&gt; is continuing to climb across the U.S. as hospitalizations rise, according to newly released data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Making Broccoli-Cheddar Butter Beans helps follow a more Mediterranean-style diet.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beans have protein and fiber and are an inexpensive pantry staple. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The dish can be adapted to fit certain diets, and it’s made with ingredients you probably have on hand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are on regular rotation in our house, and that’s not just because I’m a dietitian (though that might also have something to do with it). If you’re like me and rising grocery prices are giving you sticker shock at the checkout, beans have your back. Compared to other proteins, beans remain a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7889149/cheap-healthy-foods-to-buy-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;budget-friendly staple&lt;/a&gt; that’s a real nutrition powerhouse too—so you’re getting your money’s worth. Not to mention, if one of your goals is to follow a Mediterranean-style eating pattern, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-protein-benefits-11712145" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;plant-based proteins&lt;/a&gt; like beans just happen to be a foundational food. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But I know that not everyone loves beans as much as I do. They have a reputation for being boring and bland, but that doesn’t have to be the case. They just need plenty of seasoning or a flavorful sauce to help them shine, like most proteins do. That’s one of the many reasons why I love these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/broccoli-cheddar-butter-beans-11785020" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;broccoli-Cheddar butter beans&lt;/a&gt;. Butter beans don’t have much flavor on their own, but their creamy and tender texture pairs perfectly with the flavors of a classic comfort food like broccoli-Cheddar soup. It’s guaranteed to convert even the biggest bean skeptic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Embodies the Mediterranean Diet &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you’re looking to apply some of the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/16372/8-ways-to-follow-the-mediterranean-diet-for-better-health/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;principles of the Mediterranean-style diet&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a smart move to put this butter bean skillet on the dinner menu. This research-backed healthful eating pattern puts a heavy emphasis on eating a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7878282/complete-plant-based-diet-grocery-list/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;variety of plants&lt;/a&gt;— including vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, seeds and whole grains—and this butter bean skillet fits right in. Beans offer a winning combo of both protein and fiber to help fill you up, while broccoli adds color and a host of antioxidants to this dish. When you’re building your meals around such &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290550/10-everyday-superfoods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;nutrient-dense foods&lt;/a&gt;, it’s no wonder that the Mediterranean-style diet is associated with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-habits-for-heart-health-11796620" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mediterranean-diet-diabetes-risk-study-8736965" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;reduced diabetes risk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mediterranean-diet-foods-to-help-you-live-longer-11849104" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt;longer lifespan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Helps Me Eat More Beans &amp;amp; Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not to mention, most of us could use more beans in our diet. Research shows that eating more beans is linked with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-diet-multimorbidity-study-11796092" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower risk of chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt; like heart disease and diabetes, as well as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-you-should-do-everyday-for-better-gut-health-11782347" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;better gut health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, there are so many positive health benefits to beans that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that everyone should be eating 1½ cups of beans per week—but most Americans fall short.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So why not up your bean intake (and reap all the benefits) while indulging in classic comfort food flavors? You’ll also score a bunch of fiber (thanks to the butter beans)—just one serving of this recipe provides 12 grams of fiber, more than 40% of your daily fiber intake!&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s a Weeknight Time-Saver &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another reason that this broccoli-Cheddar butter beans recipe has become a staple in our dinner rotation is that it can be whipped up in just 30 minutes. As I’m sure many parents to young kids know, there’s nothing like the post-school rush to get something on the table. That’s why I always keep my pantry stocked with a couple of varieties of canned beans, since they’re such a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290653/30-minute-dinner-solutions-the-ingredient-staples-you-should-always-have-on-hand/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;time-saving staple&lt;/a&gt;. And speaking of saving time, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitian-favorite-30-minute-one-pot-recipes-8386779" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;one-pot meals&lt;/a&gt; are always on my radar because the less time I have to spend doing dishes after dinner, the better. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Flexible &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although the recipe is delicious as written, I don’t always have all the ingredients on hand when the craving strikes. Luckily, this recipe can be easily adapted. The fresh broccoli can be switched out for frozen in a pinch—no need to even thaw it, just toss it in frozen. Plus, if you can’t find butter beans, you can swap them for white beans, lima beans or even chickpeas. For those with vegan or dairy-free eaters in the family, you can adjust the recipe to accommodate them too. Simply use &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290343/how-to-start-eating-dairy-free/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dairy-free versions&lt;/a&gt; of butter and Cheddar cheese and swap the half-and-half for coconut milk. (That’s one of my go-to plant-based swaps for creamy dishes!)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I happily eat this up with a slice of sourdough or two, while my husband likes pairing it with a simple salad to round out the meal.

None of the infected women had been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When infants were 2 weeks old, they underwent quantitative 3D volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Two years later, they were assessed with the Third Edition of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III) and the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA). Mothers were also evaluated with the Perceived Stress Scale to account for psychological distress that may have exacerbated the effects of SARS-CoV-2 exposure on the fetus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to December 2023, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped collecting data on SARS-CoV-2, 163,140 infants were born to mothers infected with the virus, the study authors noted.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In historical viral epidemics, such as the H1N1 influenza and Zika viruses, prenatal exposures were correlated with risk for neuropsychiatric conditions in offspring,” they wrote. “However, the long-term effects of prenatal COVID-19 viral exposure on offspring neurodevelopment are still being discovered.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;52% of exposed kids at high risk for delayed development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In utero SARS-CoV-2 exposure was tied to significantly larger cortical gray matter and left hippocampal volumes and significantly smaller subcortical gray matter and white matter volumes. In unadjusted analyses at 2 years, 14% of toddlers in the prepandemic group were at high risk for developmental delays on the BSID-III, in contrast to 51.6% in the COVID-19 group. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While there was no significant association between SARS-CoV-2 exposure and overall BSID-III composite language score, receptive language (ability to understand written and spoken language) scores dropped significantly with in utero viral exposure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the ITSEA, 11% of children in the prepandemic group were at high risk for internalizing behavioral difficulties, compared with 24.7% in the SARS-CoV-2 group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There was no significant link between viral exposure and the ITSEA externalizing, dysregulation, or competence domains. Likewise, no statistically significant difference was noted in reported maternal psychological distress between the prepandemic group (21.7%) and those who had COVID-19 (29.4%).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possible effects on a whole generation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers said the findings highlight the potential effects of in utero SARS-CoV-2 exposure on this generation of children, including the internalizing behaviors in toddlers, an independent risk factor for the development of mood disorders over time. While many mechanisms behind the elevated risks in this group have been proposed, none have been fully elucidated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These findings highlight the need for continued surveillance to best identify and provide early interventions for at-risk children and provide new insights regarding prenatal exposures on early fetal programming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“These findings highlight the need for continued surveillance to best identify and provide early interventions for at-risk children and provide new insights regarding prenatal exposures on early fetal programming,” they wrote. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Further studies into the longitudinal effects of this exposure are currently ongoing. Further work is required to see how children exposed to the virus potentially differ from their peers who grew up with similar societal and lifestyle constraints, and if these early differences persist or diminish over time,” they added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The review identified the main symptom patterns associated with long COVID, including neurologic, respiratory, olfactory and/or gustatory, cardiopulmonary, and fatigue. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A team led by Lanzhou University researchers in Gansu, China, analyzed 64 studies from 20 countries involving 2.4 million people. They classified long-COVID patients into subtypes, either according to the co-occurrence of symptoms (30 studies), affected organ systems (16), severity of symptoms (nine), clinical indicators (three), or other factors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fatigue the most frequently identified symptom &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Across the studies that used symptom co-occurrence as the main method of classification, fatigue was the most frequently identified symptom cluster, either on its own or together with other symptoms, such as muscle and joint pain, cognitive symptoms, or shortness of breath. Other frequently paired symptoms included loss of smell and taste, anxiety and depression, and musculoskeletal pain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In studies that used organ systems as the primary classification, respiratory symptoms were the most common symptom cluster, affecting an estimated 47% of patients. Neurologic symptoms followed, at 31%, and gastrointestinal symptoms affected 28%. The authors emphasized that these figures reflect the proportion of long-COVID patients experiencing each symptom cluster within the studies, not the prevalence within the general population. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A handful of studies used severity as a classification, ranking symptoms as mild, moderate, or severe based on symptom scores, symptom counts, or quality-of-life assessments. Three studies categorized patients based on clinical indicators such as abnormal triglyceride levels and restrictive lung function on imaging. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women more likely to report fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The review also suggests that long-COVID subtypes are influenced by demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical factors. Women were more likely to experience fatigue and neuropsychiatric symptoms, while men more frequently reported respiratory symptoms. Older people were more likely to experience respiratory, cardio-renal, and ear, nose, and throat (ENT) symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Black and Hispanic populations were more prone to respiratory/cardiac and neuropsychiatric symptoms, and White individuals had higher rates of fatigue and musculoskeletal symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;COVID variants also appeared to play a role in symptom clusters. “The Alpha variant was strongly associated with olfactory and respiratory symptoms, while the Delta variant increased the risk of ENT-related symptoms,” write the authors. Plus, “a high BMI [body mass index], socioeconomic deprivation, and comorbidities such as COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease] were significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiopulmonary symptom clusters and Long COVID symptom burden.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The findings underscore that long COVID rarely affects a single organ system in isolation and highlight common classification methods and symptom clusters that support personalized care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The authors urge future research to focus on standardizing classification methods, uncovering underlying mechanisms, and validating specific subtype interventions. “This will be crucial for advancing precision medicine and improving outcomes for Long COVID patients,” they conclude. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO — Flu-related hospital visits are rising to their highest levels in over three years across Chicago as health officials say there’s still time to get vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;The positivity rate of people testing for influenza is just over 24 percent, with emergency room visits spiking to “very high” levels, &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/supp_info/infectious/respiratory-illness/respiratory-illness-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;according to the latest data&lt;/a&gt; Saturday from the Chicago Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those levels are the highest since 2022. All age groups have seen increases, but most notably among children 17 years and younger, according to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rise is driven by a new variant of the flu, known as “subclade K,” that’s &lt;a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/national-international/flu-virus-new-variant-what-to-know/3869885/?amp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;led to outbreaks globally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Across the United States, there have been at least 81,000 hospitalizations and 3,100 deaths from the flu this season, including eight deaths of children, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-51.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The respiratory season is here,” the city’s health department said in a statement. “Vaccines are the best way to protect yourself and others from severe disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Free vaccinations are available at many pharmacies and the city’s standing Immunization Clinics, with locations and hours &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/supp_info/clinical_health/immunization_clinics.html#clinics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eileen Manojlovic, a family nurse practitioner with Rush University System for Health, said basic hygiene is one of the best ways to stop the flu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Keep yourself healthy, make sure to take all your medication, drink plenty of fluids, get your vaccines, stay home until you don’t have a fever, cover coughs and wash hands,” Manojlovic said. “We usually see more cases after the holidays, after everyone is around a lot of people, not eating properly.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;High stress levels and a lack of sleep can also raise your chances of catching the flu, Manojlovic said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rush offers vaccinations at its urgent care clinics, 1625 N. Harlem Ave. and 539 N. Dearborn St.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not too late to get them,” Manojlovic said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, activity is currently “moderate” and COVID activity “remains low,” according to the city health department.&lt;/p&gt;

"Vitamin B12 plays a key role in converting the food that you eat into energy and is also required for nerve function and red blood cell production," Rachael Ajmera, MS, RD, dietitian, writer, and founder of &lt;a href="https://nutrimental.co/author/rachaellink1gmail-com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Nutrimental&lt;/a&gt;, told &lt;em&gt;Health.&lt;/em&gt; While B12 is best known for being found in animal foods and fortified products, beverages can be a simple and convenient way to increase your intake. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Though plant-based milks don’t naturally contain vitamin B12, many are fortified to provide an amount comparable to cow’s milk," explained Ajmera.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for: &lt;/strong&gt;People following plant-based diets, such as vegans and vegetarians, as well as people with &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/lactose-intolerance-overview-7152514" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lactose intolerance&lt;/a&gt;, or anyone avoiding dairy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to use: &lt;/strong&gt;Use fortified plant milks in coffee, tea, cereal, oatmeal, and smoothies. Not all plant milks are fortified, so be sure to choose products that contain added B12 if you’re looking to increase your intake. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to B12, milk is an excellent source of calcium and is rich in protein, both of which are needed for bone and &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/what-to-eat-to-build-muscle-9552886" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;muscle health&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Smoothies are an excellent way to boost your intake of essential nutrients, like protein, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/food/healthy-fats" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;, vitamins, and minerals. Using yogurt as a base for smoothies is a helpful tip to increase their B12 content.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Yogurt contains naturally occurring B12, and blending it into smoothies makes it easy to consume daily," noted Ajmera. "Smoothies can be a smart way to squeeze extra vitamin B12 into your diet, especially for busy adults, teens, and picky eaters who have a hard time meeting their needs."

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for: &lt;/strong&gt;People who need an easy-to-consume source of B12, such as older adults and those with low appetite, and those looking for a nutritious, easy-to-make snack. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to use: &lt;/strong&gt;Blend yogurt with &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/frozen-fruit-vs-fresh-fruit-8749485" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;frozen or fresh berries&lt;/a&gt;, nut butter, protein powder, and milk of your choice for a balanced smoothie.  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Meal replacement drinks and &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/nutrition/best-vegan-protein-powder" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein powders&lt;/a&gt; often contain added vitamins and minerals, including B12. A single serving of fortified protein powder can cover over 100% of your daily B12 needs, depending on the brand.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides protein, these drinks provide an easy source of calories and other essential nutrients in a convenient, easy-to-prepare beverage.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-vitamin-powders"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike traditional capsules and tablets, vitamin powders offer a convenient, drinkable source of vitamins, such as vitamin B12. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ajmera recommends vitamin powders for those who have difficulty swallowing pills. "Vitamin powders typically contain highly absorbable forms of vitamin B12 that dissolve in water, making them gentle on digestion and easy to take consistently," she said. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keep in mind that vitamin powders are considered a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/supplements-7775481" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dietary supplement&lt;/a&gt; and often contain well over 1,000% of your daily needs. Because of this, they should be consumed only as recommended on the label. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"A 1-cup serving can provide nearly one-third of your daily needs for vitamin B12," said Ajmera.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kefir is also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/dairy-with-more-probiotics-than-yogurt-11760661" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;packed with probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, which are beneficial bacteria that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/foods-for-gut-health-11689997" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;support gut health&lt;/a&gt; and immune function. "This makes kefir a solid choice for anyone looking to support digestive health while also upping their intake of vitamin B12," said Ajmera.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Along with B12, kefir also delivers calcium, vitamin A, and protein, making it an all-around nutritious drink option.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When selecting drinks to boost your B12 intake, it’s important to consider the following factors:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at B12 content:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re trying to boost your B12 levels through beverages, choose products that contain at least 25% of the DV per serving. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair B12-rich drinks with B12-rich foods:&lt;/strong&gt; Drinks are one way to increase your B12 intake, but it’s also important to choose meals and snacks that contain B12.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid drinks high in added sugar:&lt;/strong&gt; Choose B12-rich drinks that are free from added sugar, as consuming &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/surprising-foods-with-sugar-11784593" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;too much added sugar&lt;/a&gt; can harm health. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drinks are not a replacement for supplementation:&lt;/strong&gt; If your B12 levels are low, drinks alone may not be enough to raise them. Talk with your healthcare provider about the best way to increase your intake and whether a supplement may be needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; B12 from supplements and fortified foods is considered safe and has no established upper limit, as excess amounts are generally excreted in your urine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, extremely high intakes are not typically necessary, as your body can only absorb small amounts of B12 at a time. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="7b5a15c4-0079-4deb-bec8-465cb32beb70"&gt;A 47-year-long Swedish study set out to provide new insights into when our bodies start to age by looking at how fitness, strength, and muscle endurance change during adulthood. The results? Our bodies begin to deteriorate as early as age 35, but there’s good news — you can slow your performance loss down by moving more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41243424/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41243424/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which was conducted at the Karolinska Institutet and published as part of the &lt;em&gt;Swedish Physical Activity and Fitness study&lt;/em&gt; (SPAF), followed several hundred randomly selected men and women, all of whom were born in 1958. Researchers assessed the participants’ maximal aerobic capacity, muscular endurance, muscle power, and physical performance using various athletic tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="7b5a15c4-0079-4deb-bec8-465cb32beb70-2"&gt;The scientists found that the general population showed similar changes in physical capacity to those previously demonstrated in elite athletes — peak physical performance is reached before age 35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;The good news is that researchers also found encouraging evidence that adults who became physically active improved their performance by 5-10%, demonstrating that physical activity can slow down the performance loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="93c6453f-b5ca-45b0-a736-522e5739a098"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="c11d2bd4-2f72-49d8-89da-07f8df9e9223"&gt;Maria Westerståhl, lecturer at the Department of Laboratory Medicine and lead author of the study, said, “It is never too late to start moving. Our study shows that physical activity can slow the decline in performance, even if it cannot completely stop it. Now we will look for the mechanisms behind why everyone reaches their peak performance at age 35 and why physical activity can slow performance loss but not completely halt it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study continues, and this year the participants will turn 68 and be examined again. The researchers hope to link the changes in physical capacity to lifestyle, health, and biological mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are you waiting for? If this isn’t motivation to keep moving in 2026, we don’t know what is!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-AmYZUTC3WNSS7EHcPkDAtB" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-AmYZUTC3WNSS7EHcPkDAtB slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr id="890bea93-d7ea-4688-b21f-d1855da3bb73"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE" rel="nofollow" id="be680a47-8de0-4365-abe0-a00d4aaf8537" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check=""&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="f60202a6-5103-43cb-8451-fd5e22306832"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE" target="_blank" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom's Guide on Google News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=tomsguide.com" target="_blank" data-url="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=tomsguide.com" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;add us as a preferred source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr id="bde7ec8a-19dd-421c-ae61-9e2fac742b9e"&gt;&lt;a id="elk-more-from-tom-s-guide" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom's Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;a id="elk-fee18381-7d87-4025-af9a-fd678d19f9bc" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
