'No kid should have to go through that.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Harper (left) and Luna Keown were both diagnosed with the rare genetic disorder Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), which leads to an insatiable appetite and uncontrolled weight gain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unable to explain the weight gain despite diet and exercise, the clinic suggested Harper undergo genetic testing last year, which revealed she had Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a rare condition affecting just under 5,000 Americans that causes weight gain and constant, insatiable hunger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition usually manifests early in childhood and progresses over time and affects nearly every major organ, eventually leading to vision loss, kidney failure and developmental delays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further testing showed Harper's younger sister, Luna, also had BBS, though she hadn't yet displayed symptoms, and both of their parents were carriers for the mutated genes that cause the condition.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Keown said: '[The doctor] was just mind-blown. She was like, "I've never heard of this before."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;BBS is caused by mutations in one of at least 24 different genes, most commonly BBS1 and BBS10, which provide instructions for the formation of cilia, hairlike structures on cells that help them relay sensory information like light, sound, smell and taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These mutations cause a dysfunction of the brain's melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) pathway, which controls hunger and satiety. If the receptor is mutated, it cannot communicate to the brain that the body is full, leading to uncontrolled eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like Harper, most patients start gaining excess weight around three to five years old, which continues into adulthood, often despite dietary changes and exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna also started to gain weight around age four, jumping from 30 to 80 pounds within a few months, more than double the weight of the average preschooler.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After their diagnosis, the girls were put on topiramate (known as Topamax), an anticonvulsant used off-label for weight loss, and Vyvanse, a stimulant used to treat ADHD and binge eating disorder, to help slow their ravenous hunger.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also take setmelanotide, a daily injection under the brand name Imcivree that targets the dysfunctional MC4R pathway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's a complete gamechanger,' Keown told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Harper, pictured here, weighed 108 pounds by the time she was seven years old, and she endured bullying so bad that her family was forced to pull her out of school&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Luna (left) and Harper are pictured earlier this year with their mother Ciara (right) after losing weight with medication and lifestyle changes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the help of the medications, as well as dietary swaps and exercise, Harper has lost 30 pounds so far and Luna has lost 10 in the last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since losing the weight, Harper has regained the confidence to return to school, where she most enjoys spending time with her friends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Keown said: 'She's braver now, like she'll stand up for herself now, whereas in kindergarten, she wouldn't stand up for herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She's not had any problems. She absolutely loves [school].'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the girls have lost weight, BBS still affects multiple major organ systems, leaving them with a team of about 10 specialists between the two of them. Luna is in the early stages of chronic kidney disease, while BBS has attacked Harper's liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In children, kidney disease can lead to growth issues, cognitive problems, anemia and incontinence. If it progresses, a kidney transplant may be necessary. And children who suffer from liver diseases may experience fatigue, nausea, a swollen abdomen, jaundice and itching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About half of children in liver failure will eventually need a transplant.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We live in and out of doctor's [offices],' Keown said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The girls both have accommodations at school for their condition, including extra time during tests due to dyslexia, which BBS raises the risk of, additional restroom breaks due to kidney issues and rest time from gym class. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Keown family is now working to spread awareness of BBS and connect with other families across the US. Harper has even helped other children with the condition work up the courage for their daily Imcivree shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Keown said: 'It's just one step at a time. I was scared at first, but it's not a death sentence, so when [other] moms reach out, I try to express that to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've heard stories of remission, so I really just want the girls to go into that. I want them to be able to to be able to manage all of this on on their own. I want them to be able just to handle this, be healthy, not have to have to have many doctors, just regular checkups every now and then in the future.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2025 16:07:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>女性正在研究她们的荷尔蒙并重新思考避孕药-华尔街日报</title><link>https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/birth-control-hormone-health-78f15942</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFB3Qlo3bHJTZG5vOFhnbm1HUEhUdWVsUnpFR1J6ZXNnZy1NMk1fRVBHRThUbzRPY2JRSDdZZngtNlMwZUJGcmNnTUltYUpyNEpERzBCa3hTeXJjcWhjQjluZ21hWEJKaWZhTDBCM2hZS2g2cGdLeE5TbUhkalpGdw</guid></item><item><title>也许您讨厌CPAP ，但不治疗睡眠呼吸暂停可能会导致微型脑出血- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/01/health/obstructive-sleep-apnea-microbleed-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;
                
    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapjmxg005x26qc7phk7fsz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Maybe you know you snore like a bear, but you don’t feel much urgency to look into it. Or maybe you have been told to wear a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machine for sleep apnea, but it is just so cumbersome.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt00083b6nfv8989o6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A new study shows that it is important to take obstructive sleep apnea seriously now –– it could impact your risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease later.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt00093b6ny2jfgi3i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea is associated with a greater risk for new microbleeds in the brain, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000a3b6n4i62pfag@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Cerebral microbleeds are a common finding in the aging brain,” said Dr. Jonathan Graff-Radford, professor of neurology at Mayo Clinic College of Medicine in Rochester, Minnesota. He was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000b3b6na3h7u7ye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Microbleeds increase with age, and people who have them have a slightly higher risk of future strokes and faster cognitive decline, Graff-Radford said. “Anything that increases microbleeds is relevant to brain aging,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000c3b6n3cbd3k5k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Obstructive sleep apnea is a condition in which a blockage of airways by weak, heavy or relaxed soft tissues disrupts breathing during sleep. The condition is different from central sleep apnea, in which the brain occasionally skips telling the body to breathe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000d3b6nq9cpmjuw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20377636" target="_blank"&gt;few ways to treat&lt;/a&gt; obstructive sleep apnea, including relying on oral devices that keep the throat open during sleep, regularly using a CPAP or similar machine, and having&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;surgeries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000e3b6n9bdsz7ou@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study has a strong methodology and should stress the importance of screening for sleep apnea to clinicians and treatment to patients, said Dr. Rudy Tanzi, professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and director of the Genetics and Aging Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000f3b6n36xvckwm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Don’t ignore it. Do something about it,” he said. “It’s not just the immediate risk for down the road for bleeds, but also later down the road for Alzheimer’s disease as well.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000g3b6njp28zsba@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not addressing obstructive sleep apnea is a double whammy, Tanzi said. Not getting enough good-quality sleep –– which can be hard to do when your breathing is impaired during the night –– has been associated with brain aging, but the microbleeds that could result may increase the risk for dementia down the line.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000h3b6ni2l13ef0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study, which was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2840617?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=102825" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday, is observational, which means that it can only establish that obstructive sleep apnea and microbleeds are associated, not that one definitively causes the other. Further studies will need to examine if treating sleep apnea can prevent microbleeds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000i3b6npivtsxwd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When is it time to ask your doctor about obstructive sleep apnea?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000j3b6ngiq9tqhg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Loud, frequent snoring is a good indicator, Tanzi said. If your partner notices pauses in your breathing while you sleep or gasping and choking, that’s another sign you should look into sleep apnea.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000k3b6nfkdupeza@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Problems during the day can be a good indicator, too. Sleepiness, trouble concentrating, irritability and increased hunger are signs you may not be getting quality sleep and that it may be time to get assessed for sleep apnea.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000l3b6na9i1gjvg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Night sweats might also be a sign of sleep apnea, as research has shown that &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/5/e002795" target="_blank"&gt;about 30% of people&lt;/a&gt; with obstructive sleep apnea have reported night sweats.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000m3b6nffaen3kt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14510-nocturia" target="_blank"&gt;Waking up at least two times&lt;/a&gt; in the night, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/27/health/weird-sleep-apnea-signs-wellness"&gt;teeth grinding&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1105630" target="_blank"&gt;morning headaches&lt;/a&gt; might also indicate a problem.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhapkzvt000n3b6nph3c83wy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The latest study “urges (people) to take it more seriously, because the damage that can come from obstructive sleep apnea can definitely be more severe than you think,” Tanzi said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

All three of the patients – two in Los Angeles and one in Long Beach – were hospitalized and are now recovering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;None of the patients had apparent links to each other and none had traveled internationally recently, indicating the virus is likely spreading undetected in some communities. There have been six cases of the new mpox variant found among travelers in the US, but this is the first sign of community spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The news comes as several European countries – Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal – also report apparent community transmission of the newer variant, and the older variant continues to circulate globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There have been more than 44,000 cases of mpox reported so far in 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/multi-country-outbreak-of-mpox--external-situation-report--59---30-october-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the World Health Organization. That’s more than the total reported in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The three cases in California appear may be linked genomically and may trace back to a travel case from August, &lt;a href="https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2025-10-29-cdc-says-3-cases-severe-mpox-california-may-be-linked-august-case" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the American Hospital Association. The industry group said this information was released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in an advisory on Wednesday, although that advisory does not appear to be available publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The US Department of Health and Human Services did not respond by press time to the Guardian’s media inquiry about potential genomic links between the cases and whether the virus appeared to be spreading in specific networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Given that the three cases in Los Angeles were all hospitalized, that lends a little bit more credence to the idea that maybe there is local transmission going on,” said Miguel Paredes, a genomic epidemiologist at the University of Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In Los Angeles, about one in 33 cases of the older mpox variant is currently being detected, according to an October &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.09.25333368v2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, co-authored by Paredes, which has not been peer-reviewed or published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If you’re thinking about a 3% case fatality rate, and we’re capturing the ones that are ‘more severe’, then we’re not really capturing the ones that are potentially less severe,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vaccination may also complicate the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Vaccines are doing a good job of sometimes preventing infection but also creating less severe disease, which is good on an individual’s side. But it also makes passive surveillance a little difficult, because if you have less severe disease, you’re less likely to seek treatment or actually think you have mpox,” Paredes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That means researchers and officials need to be more proactive about finding and monitoring cases, not just recording the cases of people who seek care, he said. Wastewater sampling would be one relatively inexpensive and unobtrusive way to monitor spread, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 2022, cases of the clade IIb mpox variant exploded internationally, infecting nearly 100,000 people around the world. About a third of the detected cases were in the US. The vast majority of those cases were among men who have sex with men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet the new variant, which appears to have emerged in mid-2023 and was first detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has not shown the same pattern. It has infected men and women, usually between the ages of 25 and 40, at roughly the same rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The outbreak in central and eastern Africa has spread through what Jason Kindrachuk calls “dense sexual networks”, or people with multiple sexual partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s a big piece of it,” said Kindrachuk, who is an international expert on mpox and vice president of the National Microbiology Laboratory branch of the Public Health Agency of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Dense sexual networks increased risk transmission generally. Regardless if you’re male or female, you had an increased probability or increased risk of getting infected if you were within those networks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But it’s difficult to know if the same pattern would continue in other countries, he said. “Trying to make assessments of what is going to happen in other regions of the world when you are looking at DRC or central Africa in general is very difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There have only been a few community cases of the new variant detected internationally, so it’s not possible yet to make broad statements about the kinds of networks where it is spreading, Kindrachuk said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;California has not released information about the gender or the sexuality of the patients. But the press release &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR25-015.aspx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;indicated&lt;/a&gt; the newer variant was “primarily impacting communities of gay and bisexual men, and other men who have sex with men, as well as their social networks”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People are at higher risk for mpox if they are gay, bisexual, or a man who has sex with men, or are transgender or nonbinary, and have had more than one partner in the past six months, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/vaccines/index.html#:~:text=CDC%20recommends%20vaccination%20if:%20%0A%20%20,months%20have%20had%20any%20of%20the%20following:" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People are also at risk if they have recently visited a sex venue, such as a sex club or bathhouse, or recently had sex at large events in places where mpox is spreading, the CDC notes. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/monkeypox" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Mpox&lt;/a&gt; spreads through close skin-to-skin contact, which makes sexual contact a major mode of transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Trump administration has gutted international aid and development work, making it much more difficult to monitor and contain outbreaks like these. Officials in the US are focusing on vaccinating people who are at risk – some of whom may only have received the first of a two-part vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I always want to encourage people to get vaccinated,” Paredes said. “It’s like a small thing that can go a long way in protecting you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vaccines are more accessible when they are provided by the government rather than through private insurance, especially among low-resource communities, Paredes said. It also helps to offer shots outside of working hours and at easy-to-reach locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It may be more challenging to employ the same techniques that worked before to curb mpox. The US government is largely shut down, and the CDC has lost about a third of its staff this year due to layoffs and resignations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many of the public health networks used during the 2022 outbreak – STI and HIV monitoring, for example – have been on the chopping block under the second Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Communities affected by mpox may once again take the lead fighting against this virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 2022, organizations and members of the queer community worked together with officials to offer testing and vaccines, including at gatherings where people may be having intimate contact like sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Really, we benefited from community-based organizations providing information and going out and trying to reduce that stigma,” Kindrachuk said. He also voiced appreciation for members of the affected communities for “empowering individuals to feel comfortable with moving forward for testing and to be able to identify risks and potential infections as well”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2025 13:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE1ySE5tWEgtSnhnWU1KYlNvR0dXeEhSNC02V1RUclMtcXlRMTNKc0xNb05VS0t1bkp3SGJuVl91TERfalU2VmNsSHJrRHdCdGQ5cEg1RFp5dWlsQUtPS0EzM2dpUVNpcVRneVZqcnhXV3ZRZFNNNGREbEhlR3phcEE</guid></item><item><title>Ozempic效应终于出现在肥胖数据中- vox.com</title><link>https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/467025/ozempic-glp-1-drugs-obesity-weight-loss</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="zephr-anchor" class="_1agbrix10"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For years, obesity rates in the US have gone in one direction: up. From the first year it was launched, &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/246200/gallup-national-health-index-work.aspx"&gt;Gallup’s National Health and Well-Being Index&lt;/a&gt; has found that the share of US adults reporting obesity has climbed and climbed, rising from 25.5 percent in 2008 to 39.9 percent in 2022. That survey caught the last leg of an epidemic that has been spreading for decades, with &lt;a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/obesity-rate-nearly-triples-united-states-over-last-50-years/"&gt;estimated obesity prevalence&lt;/a&gt; tripling over the past 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s not that the country hasn’t tried to fight weight gain. But from the $33 billion Americans &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/696599/obesity-rate-declining.aspx"&gt;spend each year on weight loss products&lt;/a&gt; and services to government efforts like first lady Michelle Obama’s &lt;a href="https://letsmove.obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/"&gt;Let’s Move campaign&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/life/459495/kids-food-maha-diet-culture-virginia-sole-smith"&gt;Make America Healthy Again&lt;/a&gt;, little has worked. Many doctors and patients came to believe the rise in obesity may be &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/25/717058877/the-biology-of-weight-loss#:~:text=That%27s%20because%20losing%20weight%20triggers,regain%20the%20weight%20you%20lost."&gt;all but biologically inescapable&lt;/a&gt;, despite the &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/adult-overweight-obesity/health-risks#:~:text=Metabolic%20syndrome%20is%20closely%20linked%20to%20overweight,help%20you%20prevent%20and%20reduce%20metabolic%20syndrome."&gt;grave health risks&lt;/a&gt; that accompany it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But maybe not. According to the latest results from Gallup’s survey, self-reported obesity has started to fall, &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/696599/obesity-rate-declining.aspx"&gt;declining by nearly 3 points&lt;/a&gt; to 37 percent in 2025. The self-reporting part is an important limitation — people’s reporting of their weight tends to be imprecise — and we’ll need more definitive proof from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be sure, but it’s some of the earliest evidence that the US may finally be turning a corner on one of the biggest health crises of the modern age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And the main reason it appears to be happening isn’t because weight-loss experts have stumbled upon a new diet that always works (we haven’t and probably never will) or because we’ve managed to ban all unhealthy junk food (we haven’t and almost certainly never will). It’s likely because of the growing use of &lt;a href="/the-gray-area/24158976/ozempic-drug-weight-loss-diabetes-risks"&gt;glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists&lt;/a&gt;, better known as GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What’s changed is we now have highly effective weight-loss medicines working at a scale that we’ve never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/2024/07/08/old-weight-loss-drugs-safety-effectiveness/#:~:text=Effective%2C%20but%20less%20so%20than,hunger%20so%20people%20eat%20less."&gt;Older weight-loss drugs&lt;/a&gt; tended to shave off only a few percentage points of body weight, and they came with tough trade-offs and quick weight rebound. The new drugs, which were originally developed to treat diabetes, are targeting the biology that makes weight so hard to lose and keep off: They &lt;a href="/science/24086968/glp-1-ozempic-semaglutide-craving-desire-science-wanting-liking-opioids-alcohol"&gt;dial down hunger in the brain&lt;/a&gt;, slow gastric emptying, and improve post-meal insulin signaling. In large randomized trials, semaglutide 2.4 mg — the active ingredient used in medicines like Ozempic — &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183?articleTools"&gt;produced&lt;/a&gt; about 15 percent average weight loss over 68 weeks when paired with basic lifestyle support. Other combinations &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2206038"&gt;have reached&lt;/a&gt; as much as 20 percent on higher doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Those effect sizes are big enough that, when even a modest share of adults use them, you can start to see movement in the population data. And as further data from Gallup shows, more and more Americans are trying these drugs, with the survey finding that more than 12 percent of adults reported taking them in the second and third quarters of 2025, up from less than 6 percent in early 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And while much of the media coverage around these drugs has &lt;a href="/science-and-health/23584679/ozempic-wegovy-semaglutide-weight-loss-obesity"&gt;focused on weight and appearance&lt;/a&gt;, the health benefits seem to go much further. In 2024 the Food and Drug Administration added &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2024/215256s011lbl.pdf"&gt;cardiovascular risk as a reason to be prescribed&lt;/a&gt; the GLP-1 drug Wegovy, grounded in &lt;a href="https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Clinical-Trials/2023/11/09/15/04/select"&gt;results from a major trial&lt;/a&gt; that showed fewer heart attacks, strokes, and cardiovascular deaths in adults with obesity or overweight and established heart disease. The FDA’s action also opened a door for &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/a-new-use-for-wegovy-opens-the-door-to-medicare-coverage-for-millions-of-people-with-obesity/"&gt;Medicare coverage in patients with cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; — an early sign that access for these expensive medicines could expand beyond the well-insured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-upside-of-downsizing-and-the-side-effects" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The upside of downsizing — and the side effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s still early days, but if the national obesity curve keeps bending down, the benefits would be enormous. &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/adult-overweight-obesity/health-risks"&gt;Obesity multiplies risk&lt;/a&gt; across nearly every major cause of death; even small, sustained declines in prevalence translate into millions fewer people living with diabetes, heart disease, sleep apnea, and painful joint disease — and billions saved in medical costs over time. The CDC pegs &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/php/about/index.html"&gt;direct medical spending&lt;/a&gt; tied to obesity at roughly $173 billion. Turning that curve even a little would represent significant relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But we’re a long way from solving this problem. For one thing, as effective as they are, these drugs behave more like statins than antibiotics: They work while you take them. When people stop, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUT8Zdb14zI"&gt;weight regain is common&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And GLP-1s do come with side effects that for some patients have been serious enough to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2829779"&gt;lead to discontinuation&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists also still aren’t sure about some of the longer-term effects of the drugs, which &lt;a href="https://www.highbarhealth.com/blog/glp1-drugs-muscle-loss-guide#:~:text=Muscle%20Loss%20and%20Musculoskeletal%20Health,on%20adequate%20surrounding%20muscle%20mass."&gt;can include muscle loss&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/classes/glp-1-agonists/glp-1-side-effects"&gt;changes to sex drives&lt;/a&gt;. And don’t forget the &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/cost-of-weight-loss-drugs"&gt;four-figure monthly side effect&lt;/a&gt; on the wallet if GLP-1s need to be paid for out of pocket. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7484407/#:~:text=Socioeconomic%20status%20(SES)%20is%20an,by%20psychosocial%20stress%20%5B14%5D."&gt;Obesity is already linked to&lt;/a&gt; lower socioeconomic status, and that disparity could worsen if GLP-1s remain out of reach for all but high-income people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Chances are, though, that the current generation of GLP-1s is the worst and most expensive we’ll ever have. Drug companies are already experimenting with &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41591-025-00060-6"&gt;pill forms of the medicine&lt;/a&gt;, which would make dosing more precise and lower the barrier to access: as much as 20 percent of the American public has some form of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8020217/#:~:text=Prevalence%20of%20Needle%20Phobia%20and,of%20population%20have%20needle%20phobia.&amp;amp;text=Hamilton%20found%20that%2010%25%20of%20the%20population%20suffered%20from%20needle%20phobia.&amp;amp;text=Taddio%20et%20al25%20and,population%20had%20a%20needle%20phobia.&amp;amp;text=These%20estimates%20suggest%20that%20between,studies%20on%20needle%20phobia%20exist.&amp;amp;text=Needle%20fear%20is%20an%20induced%20anxiety%20when%20needles%20or%20injections%20are%20used.&amp;amp;text=Diagnostic%20and%20Statistical%20Manual%20of,blood%2Dinjection%2Dinjury%20type.&amp;amp;text=Needle%20phobia%20is%20anxiety%20that,in%20the%20environment%20and%20event.&amp;amp;text=Estimating%20the%20number%20of%20patients,contact%20with%20the%20medical%20system."&gt;needle phobia&lt;/a&gt; (or trypanophobia, for those who want a great Scrabble word).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I’ll admit there’s something uncomfortable about the idea of solving obesity primarily through a drug. After all, as Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze391y17z7o"&gt;fond of saying&lt;/a&gt;, can’t we fix obesity through healthier food and more exercise? But while our food system &lt;a href="/future-perfect/370257/ultra-processed-food-obesity-disease-depression-anxiety"&gt;could surely be improved&lt;/a&gt; and most of us &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/exercise.htm"&gt;don’t get enough exercise&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not as if we haven’t tried, whether as individuals or as a country. The simple fact is that the contemporary environment is one that is &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(25)00049-0/fulltext"&gt;heavily weighted toward the obesogenic&lt;/a&gt;. GLP-1 drugs seem to offer the best chance to tilt the scales back in our favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter. &lt;a href="/pages/good-news-newsletter-signup"&gt;Sign up here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQTUxZV2c3SG9vVGx1emNtVjNuRU1XS2sxR09HVlF1eE1udERfb2NkcEtnNGVBXzJraF91WXhuNTdvZmNFWFhyUXlSUnNQSk80dEtsenNkb1NHZFpVeEpFdkxrNG0taDA1WE01SnU3cXFTbWFGMVNtVC1YRlR4blFwbGxFenVmNVNP</guid></item><item><title>“人们不了解它有多危险” - 19看似安全但实际上人们一直都在做的危险事情- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/alanavalko/seemingly-safe-but-dangerous-habits-fs</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

Researchers discovered that injecting these particles, called extracellular vesicles, from exercising mice into sedentary mice promoted the growth of new neurons in the hippocampus, a brain region important for learning and memory. The findings were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2025.150003" target="_blank"&gt;Brain Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aerobic exercise can enhance cognitive functions, in part by stimulating the birth of new neurons in the hippocampus. This process, known as adult neurogenesis, is linked to improved learning, memory, and mood regulation. Understanding the specific mechanisms connecting physical activity to brain health could lead to new therapies for age-related cognitive decline and other neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the exact biological conversation between active muscles and the distant brain has remained largely a mystery. A leading hypothesis suggests that exercise releases specific factors into the bloodstream that travel to the brain and initiate these changes. Previous work has shown that blood plasma from exercising animals can be transferred to sedentary ones, resulting in cognitive benefits. This observation has narrowed the search for the responsible agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among these potential messengers are extracellular vesicles, which are minuscule sacs released by cells that carry a diverse cargo of proteins, lipids, and genetic material. During exercise, tissues like muscle and liver release these vesicles into circulation at an increased rate. Because these particles are capable of crossing the protective blood-brain barrier, researchers proposed they might be a key vehicle for delivering exercise’s benefits directly to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The hippocampus is critical for learning and memory and atrophy of the hippocampus is associated with common mental health problems like depression, anxiety,, PTST, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease and normal aging. So figuring out ways of increasing the integrity of the hippocampus is an avenue to pursue for addressing these problems,” explained study author &lt;a href="https://rhodeslab.beckman.illinois.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Justin Rhodes&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is known that exercise increases the formation of new neurons in the hippocampus, and is a natural way to combat all the aforementioned mental health problems. It is further known that there are factors released into the blood that contribute to adult hippocampal neurogenesis. But most likely a mixture of factors rather than one magic chemical. The idea that extracellular vesicles containing lots of different kinds of molecules could communicate with complex chemical signatures from the blood to the brain and contribute to neurogenesis was not known until our study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine this, the researchers used two groups of mice. One group had unlimited access to running wheels for four weeks, while the other group was housed in cages with locked wheels, serving as a sedentary control. As expected, the running mice showed a significant increase in new brain cells in their own hippocampi, confirming the effectiveness of the exercise regimen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After four weeks, the team collected blood from both the exercising and sedentary donor mice. From this blood, they isolated the extracellular vesicles using a filtration method that separates particles by size. This process yielded two distinct batches of vesicles: one from the exercising mice and one from the sedentary mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then administered these vesicles to a new set of sedentary recipient mice over a four-week period. These recipients were divided into three groups. One group received injections of vesicles from the exercising donors, a second group received vesicles from the sedentary donors, and a third group received a simple phosphate-buffered saline solution as a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To track the creation of new cells in the recipients’ brains, the mice were given injections of a labeling compound known as BrdU. This substance is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells, effectively tagging them so they can be identified and counted later under a microscope. To ensure the reliability of their results, the entire experiment was conducted twice with two independent groups of mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that mice that received vesicles from the exercising donors exhibited an approximately 50 percent increase in the number of new, BrdU-labeled cells in the hippocampus compared to mice that received vesicles from sedentary donors or the placebo solution. The findings were consistent across both independent cohorts, strengthening the conclusion that something within the exercise-derived vesicles was promoting cell proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was surprised that the vesicles were sufficient to increase neurogenesis,” Rhodes told PsyPost. “That is because when you exercise, there is not only the contribution of blood factors, but things going on in the brain like large amounts of neuronal activity in the hippocampus that I thought would be necessary for neurogenesis to occur. The results suggest apparently not, the vesicles alone without the other physiological components of actual exercise, are sufficient to increase neurogenesis to a degree, not the full degree, but to a degree.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined the identity of these new cells to determine what they were becoming. Using fluorescent markers, they identified that, across all groups, about 89 percent of the new cells developed into neurons. A smaller fraction, about 6 percent, became a type of support cell called an astrocyte. This indicates that the vesicles from exercising mice increased the quantity of new neurons being formed, rather than changing what type of cells they became.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the team assessed whether the treatment affected the density of blood vessels in the hippocampus, as exercise is also known to promote changes in brain vasculature. By staining for a protein found in blood vessel walls, they measured the total vascular area. They found no significant differences in vascular coverage among the three groups, suggesting that the neurogenesis-promoting effect of the vesicles may be independent of vascular remodeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the reasons exercise improves mental health is that it stimulates new neurons to form in an area of your brain that is important for learning and memory and for inhibiting stress, and now we know a big piece of the puzzle as to how exercise does this,” Rhodes said. “Exercise causes tissues like muscle and liver to secrete vesicles (sacs that contain lots of different kinds of chemicals) that reach the brain and stimulate neurogenesis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those vesicles can be taken from an animal that exercises and placed into an animal that is not exercising, and it can increase neurogenesis, not to the full level of that exercise does, but significantly increase it. That strongly suggests the vesicles themselves are carrying critical information. One can imagine a therapy in the future where either vesicles are harvested from exercising humans from their blood and introduced into individuals or synthetic vesicles are made that carry the unique mixture of chemicals that are identified in the exercise vesicles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings point to extracellular vesicles as key players in exercise-induced brain plasticity, the study also highlights several areas for future inquiry. A primary question is whether the vesicles directly act on the brain or if their effects are mediated by peripheral organs. It is not yet known what fraction of the injected vesicles crossed the blood-brain barrier. The vesicles could potentially trigger signals in other parts of the body that then influence the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specific molecular cargo within the vesicles responsible for the neurogenic effect also needs to be identified. A companion study by the same research group found that vesicles from exercising mice were enriched with proteins related to brain plasticity, antioxidant defense, and cellular signaling. Future work will be needed to pinpoint which of these molecules, or combination of molecules, is responsible for the observed increase in new neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think there are a lot of ways this could go,” Rhodes told PsyPost. “First, it is a pretty big black box between injecting the animals with vesicles and neurogenesis happening in the hippocampus. How many of the extracellular vesicles make it to the brain? Are they acting in the brain or in the periphery, i.e., maybe via peripheral nerves, mesenteric nervous system, immune activation or other ways we didn’t think of yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If they are reaching the brain, how do they merge with brain cells, do they reach astrocytes first? How do the vesicles get taken up by the brain cells is it through phagocytosis? What do the chemical signals do to the brain cells that causes increased neurogenesis? Do they act directly on neural progenitor cells, or astrocytes or mature neurons? What are the signaling mechanisms involved in the communication from the extracellular vesicles to the neurons/astrocytes/progenitor cells that causes neurogenesis to occur?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2025.150003" target="_blank"&gt;Exercise-induced plasma-derived extracellular vesicles increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Meghan G.

There are far too many variables that cannot be accounted for, such as environmental factors, diet, geographic location.

The researchers then used &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3935" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;shotgun metagenomics sequencing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; on the stool samples to analyze the make-up of their gut microbiomes. A subsample of the cohort — 328 people — provided a second stool sample after a median follow-up period of 4.4 years, which the researchers also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They accessed details of participants’ current and historical prescription drug usage from their electronic health records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the first sample, participants were using a total of 433 different prescription drugs, and in the five years preceding it, they had used 507 different medications. Just over one-third of the participants (857 people) were taking no medications at the time of the first sample, and those taking medications were using, on average, three different types of medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers did not assess the effects of antibiotics at the first time point, so they excluded anyone who had taken antibiotics within 90 days of the first sample, but the second sample was assessed for the effects of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as antibiotics, beta-blockers, benzodiazepine derivatives, glucocorticoids, PPIs, biguanides, and antidepressants all had effects on the microbiome that were seen many years after previous drug intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The researchers found that the longer people took medications for, and the more medications they took, the greater the effect on the microbiome. Multiple medications appeared to interact and have a greater impact on the microbiome, but for individual drugs, it was benzodiazepines that seemed to have the greatest negative impact.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their paper, the authors warned:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given that human-targeted drugs are often taken continuously throughout life, not for short periods, which is the case for antibiotics, the physiological effects can be even more profound.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight that even past drug use can leave a lasting imprint. At the same time, we found that even within the same class of drugs, individual medications can affect the microbiome in very different ways. If two drugs work equally well, doctors may opt for the one that has a smaller impact on the gut microbiome.”&lt;br&gt;— &lt;a href="https://ut.ee/en/employee/elin-org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Elin Οrg, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, study co-author, head of the Microbiome Research Group at University of Tartu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even within drug classes, medications had different effects. For benzodiazepines, which are commonly prescribed anti-anxiety drugs, alprazolam, sold as Xanax, was found to have a much broader impact on the microbiome than diazepam (Valium). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The noted difference in the effects on the microbiome by alprazolam versus diazepam might be a valuable input for future therapy decisions and warrants further investigation,” the authors noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-022-00974-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; (or microbiota) was discovered in the early 1900s, it has become increasingly evident that the approximately 100 trillion bacteria, fungi, and yeasts that live in the human gut play a key role in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A healthy microbiome is a stable community with high diversity of microorganisms and high microbial gene richness that lives in balance with its human host. However, factors such as diet, antibiotics and, age &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6699480/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;can change the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, often adversely affecting health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disruption of the microbiome, or &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6314516/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;dysbiosis&lt;/a&gt;, is linked to diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), obesity, allergic disorders and asthma, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmune disorders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antibiotics, particularly broad-spectrum antibiotics kill off beneficial bacteria in the gut as well as the bacteria that they are intended to destroy to clear infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other drugs, however, act in different ways, as Firoozi explained:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a broad sense, medications such as anti-depressants, beta blockers, and benzodiazepines can affect intestinal motility which in turn likely has an effect on gut bacteria by slowing transit through the intestinal tract. Proton pump inhibitors have long been linked to affecting the gut microbiota mostly through eliminating a key defense against bacterial growth, namely gastric acid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He suggested that benzodiazepines might also impact a person’s gut microbiome by changing their eating habits, and diet is closely connected to the health of the microbiome.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While emphasizing that people should follow their doctor’s instructions, Firoozi recommended taking medications only as prescribed and only for as long as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Particularly with benzodiazepines, long-term use should be strongly discouraged, as it easily leads to dependency and is linked to cognitive decline. For PPI medications, the need to continue the medication should be discussed at least every 2 months, with every effort to try and wean off the medication,” he advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He also recommended following a high fiber, low fat diet, minimizing red and processed meats, eating fewer processed foods, and taking regular exercise to promote overall gut health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2025 10:05:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPeHJFSDhjOHpGZm1kOUhObmthSjdWOGNfaF9LeWFnb0JUakF5bEZsTzRGVmhIbDJqUlRsLVpVQkp4blpwMTI2c0tJZTlZd2c5aGl2b0s2Z1Z0RTJMam0yN2V1Z0pkZXp5b1V2QVFqSGxOeWhJdGkxV1FhaXN4VG1IaFhGYU5qZ1ZNSzZ1MFpFTTduOU9ic0JFbjB5Qk96U2I2dThmaEoxeG1OUDFQTUFjeUJ6eXk3d0otbFR5dUpWc3o</guid></item><item><title>想要重新连接您的过去以修复现在的科学家- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/the-scientists-who-want-to-rewire-your-past-to-fix-the-present-2000679500</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl "&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Memories are the language we use to tell the story of our life—an ever-changing language.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the last several decades, &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/news/podcasts/speaking-of-psychology/memory-manipulated"&gt;scientists&lt;/a&gt; have shown just how malleable our memories really are. We don’t so much recall the past when we remember something; rather, we recall our recollection of the past. And every time we dig back into the crevices of our mind, the details of our remembrances can shift ever so slightly for any number of reasons, including our current emotional state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Usually, this system works perfectly fine enough. But sometimes, we can conjure up or even be coerced into creating &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/false-memories-can-form-within-seconds-study-finds-1850303900"&gt;false memories&lt;/a&gt; of events that never happened, a phenomenon that’s occasionally fueled &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/arts/satan-wants-you-filmmakers-q-a-sean-horlor-steve-j-adams-1.6822213"&gt;moral panics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/convicted-memory"&gt;wrongful convictions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Scary as all this might sound, some neuroscientists have started to explore the positive implications of our shifting memory. If it’s possible to induce a traumatic false memory in someone, for instance, why not a happy one? Or maybe we can &lt;a href="https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/select-memories-can-be-erased-leaving-others-intact"&gt;erase&lt;/a&gt; real traumatic memories that are greatly contributing to a person’s depression, or at least &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3679540/"&gt;blunt&lt;/a&gt; the emotional toll of those memories. Some people might also benefit from interventions that would allow them to more easily recall &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2015/recalling-happier-memories-reverse-depression-0617"&gt;happier memories&lt;/a&gt; during times of turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2012, Steve Ramirez—a PhD student at the time—and his colleagues at MIT &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11028"&gt;began&lt;/a&gt; to publish research that helped propel the now fast-growing field of memory manipulation. They &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1239073"&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; that it’s possible to physically and reliably implant a false memory in the brains of lab mice.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In his upcoming &lt;a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691266688/how-to-change-a-memory?srsltid=AfmBOopXW3q8xIsUWspianYd4HRoSFLFGAZHvO8ykP-M2Y7bH0_ryicq"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;How to Change a Memory: One Neuroscientist’s Quest to Alter the Past&lt;/em&gt;, Ramirez details the early neuroscience research that made his experiments possible, the leaps and bounds that he and other scientists have made since, and the potential expansive future that lies ahead for the field. The book isn’t just a breezy summary of memory research, though, it’s an engaging and at times heartbreaking telling of Ramirez’s personal journey pursuing this research. At the heart of this journey are the memories of his mentor, research partner, and friend Xu Liu, who &lt;a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/notable-young-neuroscientist-dies-35915"&gt;unexpectedly died&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 37 not long after their professional collaboration at MIT had ended.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Gizmodo reached out to Ramirez to talk about the origins of his book, the ethics of manipulating memory, and why learning about the foibles of remembering has made him an optimist. The following conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and grammar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ed Cara, Gizmodo: &lt;/strong&gt;The book is equal parts memory science and memoir. Was this something you set out to do from the get-go, or an idea that emerged along the way as you were writing it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve Ramirez: &lt;/strong&gt;I have a two-tiered answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I knew that I’ve always wanted to write a book. That’s just a childhood dream that I had ever since exploring places like Barnes and Nobles growing up and just getting lost in the bookstore.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;I always thought it would be awesome to produce something that one day belongs there. I had no idea really what I would write about; I just knew that it was a goal of mine to write a book in general. And I also grew up really consuming as much nonfiction as possible. So people like Oliver Sacks, Steven Pinker, and Mary Roach. I really loved their approach to book writing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But admittedly, those kinds of books always left me feeling like, “Man, this all sounds awesome. I just wish I knew a little bit more about the human element that was involved in producing all of the grand discoveries that they talk about in their books.” So I figured when I started writing the book, the only way I could tell this story is from a personal lenses. Because I’m both a person and a scientist.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Usually, the world only tends to see the outcomes of your work, the discoveries or the papers. But the human element part was the one that I always felt was missing, something that’s still very much me. So I wanted to infuse that voice in it as much as possible, so that it could be as authentic as possible. And that admittedly was the hardest part of this whole journey, because that’s the part where I had to really learn to turn complicated thoughts into words, let alone the written word, and into a narrative. But it was also the most rewarding part because I do think that I just gained like a whole new language for conveying my own thoughts and feelings around science, around my friendship with Xu, and around the discoveries we made.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I felt that if I could give the reader as close to a 360 degree view of what it means to be a person doing science, then I produced the kind of book that I was really longing for, so to speak, growing up.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo: &lt;/strong&gt;Can you give us a bird’s eye view of the science surrounding memory manipulation? Just how far have things progressed since the studies that you and Liu conducted over a decade ago?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramirez:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s mind boggling to be honest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I mention towards the very end of the book about how what started as one paper and one poster with Xu and I has turned into so much more.  We just had a meeting in Ireland this past year that had a couple hundred researchers with dozens and dozens of posters. It’s a whole meeting dedicated to this topic that wasn’t really in existence a decade, a decade and a half, ago. So the field has just become so expansive in both in its techniques and its concepts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s kind of dizzying in all the best ways because I think it’s as close to a mini-renaissance in memory research as we could have hoped for. Not only are there hundreds and hundreds of projects that are focused on trying to manipulate engrams [&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;uthor’s note: engrams are considered the physical traces of memory created in the brain]&lt;/em&gt; and seeing what we can do with them, but there are now whole generations of new scientists working in the field trying to chip away at this problem of how memory works. So it’s been inspiring and dizzying at the same time to see the field in its heyday.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just to give a quick glimpse—because the field has been so extraordinarily prolific in the last decade and a half. But what started as our ability to artificially turn on one specific memory in the brain has turned into success story after success story. We’ve been able to restore memories that have started to be lost in all sorts of cases, from amnesia to Alzheimer’s disease to sleep deprivation to addiction. We’re even now activating positive memories in all sorts of contexts, whether it’s models of depression, anxiety, and so on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo: &lt;/strong&gt;It seems like there will be very real therapeutic applications based on this work soon enough. But I think for many people, this kind of research also evokes Hollywood-inspired fears of mass mind control or other scary futures &lt;em&gt;(Total Recall, Inception,&lt;/em&gt; etc). How do we ensure that memory manipulation will be done ethically in people, especially as it starts to reach the medical toolbox?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramirez: &lt;/strong&gt;We have to have an ongoing, fully transparent conversation between everyone. It doesn’t matter if it’s the top floor of the ivory tower, the first floor of the ivory tower, or just the lay audience. Everyone has a stake here, because it has to do with something that presumably everyone has, which is memory. So I think if we continue to have this kind of transparent public-facing dialogue about what memory manipulation can really mean, then I think we can not just use it for the greater good, but we can also establish important seat belts so that to prevent misuse.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;We’re definitely not Total Recall-ing or Inception-ing the human brain right now. But we also weren’t genetically engineering embryos 30 years ago, before the Human Genome Project was published. So we want to start this conversation decades in advance, so that if and when we get there, we have the proper seat belts to prevent misuse. And it’s not perfect, but I think that one way we can lean into this is by saying, “Let’s give ourselves some ethically bounded or motivated goal for this kind of research.” And in my opinion, the goal is to understand memory so that we can restore health and wellbeing to an individual, and therefore to people.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So if our goal is to use this to promote human flourishing in any capacity that involves wellbeing and restoring health, then we’re in business because then it means that we could use these kinds of approaches in a clinical setting or in a medicinal setting. So we’re not just wiping away the memories from someone like me, Steve, who can’t get over a high school breakup—because life will teach me how to learn and grow beyond those kinds of events.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;But we can use it in a clinical setting for the person who’s really debilitated by any given disorder. We can have a medical framework to work from, in the same way that we wouldn’t prescribe an antidepressant to the whole population of Boston, but we would give it to the person living with depression who really would benefit from it. If health restoration is the goal, then we can at least begin to work with that kind of similar infrastructure, while also trying to prevent misuse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo:&lt;/strong&gt; Speaking as a journalist who’s &lt;a href="https://psmag.com/social-justice/dangerous-idea-mental-health-93325/?_gl=1%2Ai5n5p4%2A_ga%2AMTMzNjIyMjY3NC4xNzYxODUwMzE1%2A_ga_S92XYRE0WP%2AczE3NjE4NTAzMTQkbzEkZzAkdDE3NjE4NTAzMTQkajYwJGwwJGgw"&gt;investigated&lt;/a&gt; how false memories can lead people astray in horrific ways, learning about the fragility of memory has been existentially frightening at times. But it seems like your research has left you with an overall optimistic perspective—a trend I’ve noticed with other memory scientists I’ve chatted with! At least for you, why is that?&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramirez: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m glad you asked, because I really do think that it’s shaped my rosy outlook.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think I have a deep respect for what memory is and for what it can be. And I’ve certainly experienced the highs of memories, sitting with a positive memory and feeling motivated, and the lows of memories, recalling something surrounded by grief or loss that can immediately put me in a more pensive or somber state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So the fact that memory can do that in just a few seconds without really even breaking a sweat is so—it’s almost awe-inspiring. And I think that throughout my career, especially with the ability to tinker with memories, I’ve just gained such a deep respect for this cognitive faculty that we have that can do amazing things. And I’ve also started to think about it as something that we can imbue with healing properties.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the big picture, I hope by spreading that kind of deep appreciation for what memory is and can be, that we can all connect a little bit more. Because when I hear from people who are in recovery who are at meetings, those are underpinned by everyone’s memories and lived experiences of the hardships that they’ve had to deal with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But sharing those kinds of memories immediately connects the room at a really fundamentally human level. And I think that if we all took a step back, I am willing to bet anything that we all have at least one memory we can share that will connect us with practically anyone else in the world. And then suddenly, connection becomes the theme, and then being a little bit more empathetic or sympathetic or tolerant suddenly comes into play.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s what gives me the sort of rosy-eyed view of what the world can be, because it’s certainly not a reflection of where the world is now, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo: &lt;/strong&gt;What do you most hope readers can take away from your book?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramirez:&lt;/strong&gt; I hope that they take away that deep appreciation for what memory really can be—its ability to transport us back to the most meaningful moments of our past, or to be used as building blocks to imagine whatever future we want to imagine. That it’s really almost this magical property that our brain has that it endows us with so effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;On the personal front, I hope that readers take away from it the very human process that doing science actually is like. Because science just produces truths that exist in the pantheon of truths in the world, but the process of getting there is a very topsy-turvy, roller coaster, flawed, and exciting human endeavor. So that I hope this at least paints that picture in a little bit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, what a reader can really come away with appreciating isn’t just that we have memories, but that we also are all, fortunately and unfortunately, depending on your perspective, destined to become memory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think there’s a lot of power in that realization, and that was one way I came to terms with the time I spent with Xu. And I think one way of reconciling, or at least resolving, that hard-to-swallow pill of someday becoming memory is that we live a life that one day might be honored in a similar way as how I am using this book to honor my friend. And that’s a way of addressing not just the more difficult memories of our past, but even honoring our grief and really putting that part of memory at center stage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So it’s a long-winded answer, but basically I hope that people connect with some of the memories I’ve shared, and maybe they’ll see a little bit of themselves and connect with that as well. Because then there’s a very real human conversation to be had there, one that is less intimidating and more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

It's the one wellness trend that never dies, pushing everyone to buy expensive powders, bars, and shakes as if our lives depended on it. Just like &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/stop-counting-calories/" target="_self"&gt;counting calories&lt;/a&gt; can get a little too serious, protein intake goals have also gotten out of hand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;Here's the truth your wallet needs to hear: you're probably getting plenty of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We talked to an actual cardiologist who said it's "nearly impossible" to be protein deficient in the US. So if we're all getting enough, why is every influencer still screaming about it? It's time to stop obsessing over (and overpaying for) the one thing you're not missing and find out what your body actually needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=cnet.com" target="_self"&gt;Don't miss any of CNET's unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You're likely getting enough protein without even trying&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as you're not heavily restricting yourself and getting enough calories to fuel your body, you're probably hitting your protein goals just by eating a typical American diet. While some people may need more to feel satisfied and strong or to maximize their muscle gains in the gym, the reality for many Americans might be that they meet their protein requirements through their daily diet. For some, that requirement may be well below &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/how-much-protein-do-you-really-need-a-visual-guide-for-every-type-of-eater/" target="_self"&gt;100 grams&lt;/a&gt;, which is one elusive &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10772463/" target="_self"&gt;protein goal&lt;/a&gt; often touted, including by the wellness team here at CNET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are absolutely obsessed with protein," Freeman said, pointing to the fact it's also likely you'll hit your "protein goals" even if you're eating a plant-based diet, as long as it's varied and full. One potentially influencing factor toward the protein goal trend is the rise in interest in the carnivore diet, which prioritizes meat consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What most people forget is some of earth's biggest and strongest mammals, they're all plant-based," Freeman said. "When was the last time you saw a protein-deficient gorilla or elephant?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans, in particular, have a complicated and sometimes disordered relationship with food -- when we're not obsessing over getting enough of something (#proteingoals), we're restricting something else (think the villainization of fats and carbs). Examples of some diets that oscillate between these extremes include the ketogenic diet, the carnivore diet, calorie-counting apps and taking extra time to make &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/ozempic-oatzempic-and-finding-the-grain-of-truth-in-the-latest-weight-loss-hack/" target="_self"&gt;complicated drinks in the name of weight loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would be more defensible if we were reaping the health benefits of sticking to these diets, but instead, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-disease/about/index.html" target="_self"&gt;Americans are leaders in chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/what-causes-heart-disease-here-are-the-symptoms-and-things-to-look-out-for/" target="_self"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and diabetes (preventable and often reversible through diet). Many people also suffer a reduced quality of life from restricting themselves or following diets that may or may not meaningfully improve their health down the line or may also inspire shame or eating disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, most of us are &lt;em&gt;actually deficient&lt;/em&gt; in fiber and a good chunk of us are low in other very important nutrients, such as iron and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/vitamin-d-supplements-explained-who-should-take-them/" target="_self"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, all the focus on protein ends up causing people to overlook other nutrients their body needs that they can't get from protein. Fiber, for example, is a key carbohydrate that is found mainly in plants and should also be prioritized, especially with the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html#:~:text=The%20rate%20of%20people%20being,year%20from%202012%20to%202021." target="_self"&gt;rising rates in colorectal cancer &lt;/a&gt;among people younger than 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is absolutely not to say that protein isn't important or that some people need more than others based on their activity level or the muscle build they're going for. Here, we merely take a minute to plead the case that, with protein, you may be able to cool it a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much protein should you actually be eating?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look, the intro to this topic came on a little strong, so it is important to take a moment and stress how protein is an absolutely vital nutrient: &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002467.htm#:~:text=Every%20cell%20in%20the%20human,%2C%20teens%2C%20and%20pregnant%20women." target="_self"&gt;Protein contains&lt;/a&gt; amino acids, which build our bodies and help them function. If we didn't eat protein, we'd be dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get a baseline of how much we need to support our needs, there's fortunately a &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-protein-do-you-need-every-day-201506188096#:~:text=How%20much%20protein%20do%20I,meet%20your%20basic%20nutritional%20requirements." target="_self"&gt;recommended daily amount&lt;/a&gt;, or RDA, of protein. This is 0.8-gram of protein per kilogram of body weight. (There are about 2.2 pounds in one kg.) This means a person who weighs 200 pounds needs about 73 grams of protein to meet their needs and not be deficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where it gets tricky is deciphering exactly how much protein you need not only to stay alive but to thrive. Like every health "thing," what's best for you will depend on your body and your activity level, for example. But even taking this into account, you may not have to work as hard as you think to get adequate protein, even if you're hitting the gym regularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2023 &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMwf_9wqWY0" target="_self"&gt;podcast hosted by Zoe&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition science company and maker of at-home gut microbiome test kits, Stanford University professor and nutrition researcher Christopher Gardner explained why fears of falling short in the protein department are often overblown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When the US comes up with recommended daily allowances for protein, vitamins and minerals, the standard approach is to take two standard deviations above the average," Gardner explained in the podcast. For the 0.8-gram of protein per kilogram of weight, he said, "You've picked a number that should be adequate for 97.5% of the population."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if you're above average? Chances are, you're not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To me, it's the American idea of 'that's what the RDA is, but I know I'm above average, so let me make sure I get some extra here,'" Gardner explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was built in to recognize that some people need more [protein]," he continued, going on to explain that when you're working out heavily, you're naturally going to feel hungrier, which will prompt you to eat more -- which means (for most people), naturally eating more protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if you want to really gain muscle? To its credit, and in a refreshing turn of American-diet events, the protein goal trend&lt;em&gt; is&lt;/em&gt; focused on adding rather than restricting. And if you're into intense weightlifting, or &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/why-do-some-people-put-on-muscle-more-easily-than-others/" target="_self"&gt;if you want to gain muscle&lt;/a&gt;, you will need more. But chances are that "more" is not as much more as you might think -- at least if you're considering consciously adding protein through shakes and other supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to build muscle or are seriously into weight lifting, estimates on how much "extra" protein you need varies, and the best (and safest) advice is always to talk to your doctor or nutritionist to take your whole health and lifestyle into account. But some estimates land around 1.2 to 1.7 grams per kilogram of weight. Others are &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-much-protein-per-day-build-muscle#How-much-protein-is-too-much" target="_self"&gt;even higher&lt;/a&gt;, at up to 2 grams per kilogram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discussion assumes you enjoy &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/stop-counting-calories/" target="_self"&gt;counting your macros&lt;/a&gt;, though. If you eat when you're hungry, fuel up after a hard workout and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/be-intentional-about-boosting-your-protein-with-these-7-easy-tips/" target="_self"&gt;choose foods that are rich in protein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; part of a well-balanced diet, you should be good to go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to weightlifting, Freeman said that people with medical concerns, such as undergoing surgery or recovering from burns, need more protein. &lt;a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/eating-right-before-and-during-pregnancy#:~:text=Protein-,Preconception.,percent%20of%20your%20calorie%20intake." target="_self"&gt;Pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/483772" target="_self"&gt;older adulthood&lt;/a&gt; are other instances when people's protein requirement goes up a bit in relation to their calorie intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Yaorusheng/Moment via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can you get too much protein? What about protein's benefits? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;High protein consumption makes the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-extra-protein-for-your-child-is-unnecessary-and-possibly-dangerous#:~:text=For%20younger%20children%2C%20it%20breaks,and%20girls%20need%2046%20grams." target="_self"&gt;kidneys work harder&lt;/a&gt;, which may be a concern for some and is one reason parents should be wary of giving kids extra protein supplements, according to the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, hitting your high protein goals or even exceeding them shouldn't be harmful for most people, although keep in mind that after they're broken down into those vital amino acids and the energy is expended, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/are-you-getting-too-much-protein#:~:text=Although%20adequate%20protein%20throughout%20the,energy%20or%20stored%20as%20fat." target="_self"&gt;excess protein&lt;/a&gt; is stored as fat if not used for energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now for a benefit: In addition to overall body function and muscle building, protein is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15466943/" target="_self"&gt;very filling and satiating&lt;/a&gt;. This means a protein-rich meal may aid in weight loss (if that's your goal) because it keeps you full for longer when compared, for example, to a meal that's more carb-heavy and lacking in protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Craving protein? You could be low in iron &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 95% of Americans aren't eating enough fiber, according to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6124841/#:~:text=Although%20adequate%20intake%20of%20all,consume%20recommended%20amounts%20of%20fiber." target="_self"&gt;research from 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Fiber is found in plant-based foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains and seeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly one in three of us are also &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/iron-deficiency-symptoms/" target="_self"&gt;low in iron&lt;/a&gt;, which is where things get interesting in the protein discussion, because excellent sources of protein are often excellent sources of iron. (Steak and other red meat, for example.) However, there are plant-based foods like dark greens that are high in iron and also in fiber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D, a nutrient we can get from the sun as well as from our food, is &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15050-vitamin-d-vitamin-d-deficiency" target="_self"&gt;also one Americans tend to be lower in&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf3hdun0058zcksfsjqpmp5@published"&gt;At 2:07 a.m., after three hours of combing through my hair, I found the culprit behind my itchy scalp. I zoomed in with my phone camera and, swallowing a gag, confirmed what I’d feared: At 25 years old, I had a case of head lice.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf3kgml001c3b78glruqwdt@published"&gt;The children I babysit gave it to me as an anniversary gift this January, a celebration of 20 years since my first encounter with the bugs. I’d dealt with infestations at ages 5, 8, 12, 17, and now 25—so I knew my next steps. But I didn’t know why this kept happening to me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf3kgmm001d3b78a2idheen@published"&gt;I caught one of my early infections after a slumber party where we girls huddled shoulder to shoulder watching Amanda Bynes confess her love in &lt;em&gt;What A Girl Wants.&lt;/em&gt; Later they crawled over while I shared a pillow with my heartbroken high school best friend. We cursed her ex-boyfriend, and the lice wanted to help. In college, I narrowly escaped the infestation that ravaged my freshman dorm. Our floor spent countless nights piling onto twin beds, sharing snacks and classroom drama, making this new space feel like home.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf3kgmm001e3b786j44n9gx@published"&gt;“This is why that thing always happens to you guys,” my friend’s mom once commented on a photo of us lying head-to-head at the beach. And it is! Thinking it over while the lice technician zapped my hair with bug-killing heat, I came to a conclusion: Lice are my ultimate testament to girlhood.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf3kgmm001f3b78ztejsmxw@published"&gt;Of course, girls aren’t the only ones who get lice. Plenty of people of all genders, especially those with longer hair, come face-to-face (or face-to-head) with the pests. For me though, these bugs have become a symbol of the close-knit communities that have shaped my life as a girl.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="111" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf3kgmn001g3b78i2fsuang@published"&gt;“Lice were here before us, and they’ll outlive us all,” my mom says every time I break the itchy news to her. And these tiny, resilient, blood-sucking insects will. According to Lice Clinics of America, the species developed 1.68 million years before &lt;em&gt;homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;. Today, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lice/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; estimates head lice infect 6 to 12 million people per year, traveling from scalp to scalp and laying eggs along the way. And as time goes on, they’ve only evolved to survive lice-killing innovations. “Mother Nature has a better laboratory than we do,” says Harvard entomologist Richard Pollack. “So this is a problem we’re always going to have to deal with.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf3kgmo001h3b780mpx62ex@published"&gt;But over all those years, their means of infection hasn’t changed. Head lice have always traveled exclusively through head-to-head contact—it’s community that keeps them alive. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lice/about/head-lice.html"&gt;CDC,&lt;/a&gt; some studies suggest that young girls are the group most likely to contract the critters. Part of that reasoning comes down to the obvious. The vast, dark, and warm environment of many girls’ long hair makes an ideal home for lice. But there’s also a more sociological explanation. Women and girls are socialized as community builders who connect through physical and emotional intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="109" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf3kgmo001i3b78g9204cc7@published"&gt;So, while the bugs inhabit children’s hair more often, Pollack promises me that head lice can be par for the course for an adult with close-knit, caring relationships, “But in addition to emotional support, you run the risk of contracting some viruses,” he says. As he talks, a montage plays: The 2-year-old I nanny wails into my neck after a scooter topple, my head nods off on a pal’s shoulder during our road trip to the Women’s March, and my eight besties squeeze on a bed, reassuring our friend she’s&lt;em&gt; much&lt;/em&gt; better than that scumbag from English class. (This whole thing is set to Willie Nelson’s “Seven Year Itch.”)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="126" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf4fzh6002p3b78i5kjmgw6@published"&gt;“Women want interdependence and to nurture their friends,” friendship expert Anna Goldfarb says. Studies show women engage in “&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-4880-4_5"&gt;face to face&lt;/a&gt;” friendships, meaning that women often spend time with their girlfriends just connecting, not necessarily doing an activity. &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.37.5.645"&gt;Researchers&lt;/a&gt; found that women tend to express more physical affection in friendships, and &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1981-27895-001"&gt;psychologists&lt;/a&gt; found their friendships tend to be more “intense, exclusive and emotionally close.” I feel that closeness reflected in my friendships every day. During the uncertainty of the pandemic, watching 23 (yes, 23) seasons of &lt;em&gt;Survivor&lt;/em&gt; on the couch with my college roommates offered rare joy and stability. When I grieved a family member while living in Australia, my girlfriends made me food, bought me flowers, and kept me afloat 9,237 miles away from home.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf3kgmp001j3b78lpf38c6w@published"&gt;Although getting lice tends to be a grimy consequence, often &lt;a href="https://slate.com/life/2024/11/parenting-advice-friends-loneliness-village.html"&gt;inconvenience is the price we pay to reap the benefits of community&lt;/a&gt;. “Frankly, there’s nothing my daughter loves more than having a gang of kids over, mushing up on the bed and watching movies,” says pest-management entomologist Dawn Gouge. “You don’t ever want kids to stop having those lovely memories, you just have to manage the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf3kgmp001k3b78d7vx5fmx@published"&gt;That said, many of these physicality discrepancies have been studied only on a gender binary and relate to social factors discouraging physical affection among men. Anthropologist Alma Gottlieb notes that caretakers hold girl newborns more tenderly and for longer, and handle boys more vigorously and for less time. “That’s really striking when you’re talking about a creature just out of the womb,” Gottlieb says. Sarah Hedgecock, a Tulane University postdoctoral fellow who studies girlhood, says she was called “strange for a girl” growing up not wanting to hug her friends. When she’s out with her husband, she notices he’ll get a handshake and she’ll get a hug. “Touching is feminized,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf3kgmq001l3b7804hjm7pz@published"&gt;While I wouldn’t trade my intimate relationships for a lice-free scalp, “girlhood” also contributes to the gnarly stigma that getting lice carries. For a social group held to the standard of beauty and cleanliness, many girls don’t want association with an allegedly “dirty” infliction.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf3kgmq001m3b78qnw1imfk@published"&gt;During my fourth bout of lice, as a high schooler in 2015, I went to a party flaunting my brand-new pale-pink tank and freshly flat-ironed hair. I’d spent my ice-cream-scooping money to look this good in the hopes that my crush would pop the question: “Do you want to hang out?” I felt so cute all night, and then I felt … an itch. I panicked. Not out of fear of bugs potentially crawling around my scalp, but more that my crush would never talk to me again if that tickle turned out to be those all-too-familiar guests.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf3kgmr001n3b78nd0kdhxz@published"&gt;I wish that 16-year-old boy could have known the truth: Having lice doesn’t mean I’m dirty. “Human lice don’t care how often the hair is cleaned, washed, combed, or brushed,” Pollack says. “I’ve seen them as often on hair that has never been attended to as on hair that gets shampooed multiple times a day.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf3kgmr001o3b7861u6qo2f@published"&gt;What really matters to lice is that you have hair, Pollack says. And, according to Gauge, the shape of that hair makes a difference. A “round hair shaft”—flat, straight, or thin hair—hosts lice more easily. Lice struggle to grip an “elliptical hair shaft”—tightly coiled, curly hair. However, if elliptical hair is tightly braided next to the head, then lice can thrive, she says. “All they need is that ability to cling on close to the scalp.”&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf3kgms001p3b78raf54a58@published"&gt;For all the joy that having lice represents to me, I still want to get rid of the buggers. If you find a critter, first confirm that it’s a louse, not a garden insect, Pollack says. Then, you can treat it yourself with a fine-toothed lice comb and approved gel, or hire a professional. Some companies use heat treatments and some use manual removal to de-critter hair.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="66" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf3kgms001q3b78auiiahuk@published"&gt;As someone who’s tried every removal method, is it wild to say I even treasure the community-building memories within the delousing process? My best friend and I would jump on her backyard trampoline with olive oil–soaked hair, thrilled to skip school while our moms (less thrilled) poured wine and waited for the “lice detectives” to arrive. We laughed, flipped, and selfied, feeling connected by being partners-in-bug.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf3kgmt001r3b78ft0vggbt@published"&gt;Yes, bugs in your hair are gross. But so is sitting on the ground of a bar with your college friends, spit pacts with summer-camp bunkmates, and weekends of pizza-filled &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt; binges with your roommates. That’s girlhood—messy, close, unfiltered, and worth every &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;inconvenience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Gideon has 42 diagnoses, including deafness, blindness, &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/cameron-boyce-die-epilepsy-neurosurgeon-explains/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:epilepsy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://people.com/mom-with-cerebral-palsy-found-resiliency-after-giving-birth-exclusive-11825301" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cerebral palsy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cerebral palsy&lt;/a&gt;. He requires 24-hour, round-the-clock nursing care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gideon is an amazing person, but literally a million-dollar kid,” says Kathleen, referring to the high cost of caring for his medical needs. And although nurses provide invaluable help, much of his care is handled by his family. “When you have something so stressful in your life all the time without having respite, it can be devastating.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Kathleen Muldoon&lt;/p&gt; Gideon Dobson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respite facilities like Ryan House offer short-term caregiving for children with medical complexities. They give caregivers a much-needed break — as well as peace of mind that their children are safe, happy and being looked after by trained professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Gideon is at Ryan House, Kathleen, 48, and Seth, 48, can take Gideon’s siblings, Genevieve, 14, and Cormac, 9, to do things that Gideon can’t do, like go camping or hiking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kathleen doesn't want them to feel like they are less of a priority, even though Gideon's needs "are so intense." She says they need — and deserve — their parents' full attention. Ryan House makes it possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Kathleen Muldoon&lt;/p&gt; The Dobson Family&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kathleen is sharing her family’s story with PEOPLE as part of &lt;a href="https://childrensrespitehomes.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Children’s Respite Homes of America;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Children’s Respite Homes of America&lt;/a&gt;, a national movement working to expand pediatric respite and hospice care across the United States.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents just need a break,” says Jonathan Cottor, CEO and founder of the &lt;a href="https://www.ncppch.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Center for Pediatric Palliative Care Homes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Center for Pediatric Palliative Care Homes&lt;/a&gt;, which is another name for Children’s Respite Homes of America. He and his wife, who live in Scottsdale, Ariz., opened Ryan House in 2010. It's named after their 17-year-old son, Ryan, who died in December 2018 after battling the neuromuscular condition &lt;a href="https://people.com/insurance-denies-newborn-twins-fatal-disorder-treatment-8641768" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:spinal muscular atrophy.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;spinal muscular atrophy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explains the thinking behind the facility: “The number one thing that a family who has a child with a very significant complex medical condition wants more than anything in the world is a cure for their child," Cottor says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The second-biggest wish that families have: 'Just give me a good night's sleep. Just give me a break every once in a while so that I can rest and recharge. Then I can get back to this very difficult journey, tackle the next challenge, and the one after that.' These homes give families a respite from the exhaustive nature of caregiving a child with severe medical needs. They can reconnect as a couple and as a family.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are currently fewer than 10 homes like Ryan House across the country. Cottor's goal is 50 in the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Kathleen Muldoon&lt;/p&gt; Gideon Dobson when he was born on November 12, 2013&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, Kathleen never thought her family would be affected by severe disability. As a professor of anatomy at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth (Seth was a professor of anthropology at Dartmouth College), she was well-versed in embryo health. "My specialty in teaching was embryology, or the formation of people before they’re born," she says. “I knew too much, but not enough — I didn’t know the lived experience of disability, I knew the textbook experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And although she had a textbook pregnancy and delivery with Gideon, 18 hours after he was born, he had a rash, his belly was enlarged and he was jaundiced, all signs of a viral infection &lt;a href="https://people.com/human-interest/deaf-baby-hears-parents-cochlear-implants/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:congenital cytomegalovirus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;congenital cytomegalovirus&lt;/a&gt; (cCMV.) It's a condition caused by a virus that can be passed from mom to baby during pregnancy, according to &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cmv/symptoms-causes/syc-20355358" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Once transmitted, it stays in the body for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gideon's diagnosis, his mother knew, was not curable — and it would likely lead to many more health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can’t fix a brain,” she explains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Kathleen Muldoon&lt;/p&gt; Gideon as a toddler&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of his diagnosis, they were living in Vermont. “I think the first question I asked Seth was, ‘How are we going to afford this kid? What are we going to do?' " Kathleen recalls, while acknowledging her privilege of being a medical school professor with good health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gideon was initially approved for one hour a week of home health care occupational therapy, which his parents knew would not be enough. He needed trained nurses 24 hours a day, and that was cost-prohibitive. Kathleen and Seth couldn't ever take a night off; his conditions were too complex for a babysitter. And while the state would cover one evening of care, Kathleen says, they had to wait another 2 years to use the benefit again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through research, the couple found a &lt;a href="https://caseforinclusion.org/application/files/1016/4660/2403/Case_for_Inclusion_2013.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cerebral palsy inclusion report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cerebral palsy inclusion report&lt;/a&gt; that ranked each state's approaches to promoting independence and productivity, ensuring quality and safety, and keeping families together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The No.1 state on the list in 2013? Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Kathleen Muldoon&lt;/p&gt; Gideon Dobson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, even though Kathleen and her husband loved their jobs at Dartmouth and living in Vermont, she applied for a teaching job at the medical school at &lt;a href="http://www.midwestern.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Midwestern University;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Midwestern University&lt;/a&gt; in Glendale, Ariz. The family moved to Peoria, outside of Phoenix, in June 2014. Seth changed industries to work as a data analyst at Hills Science Diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About three years later, in 2017, Gideon had his first stay at &lt;a href="https://ryanhouse.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ryan House;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ryan House&lt;/a&gt;, which offers 28 overnight stays per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Respite breaks for parents are necessary if you have kids who have significant disabilities, because we have essentially become indispensable medical providers,” Kathleen says. Gideon's complex care still means no babysitters, and even his big sister can't watch him. Without Ryan House, his parents could never step away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now almost 12, Gideon is non-verbal. He cannot talk but can communicate with a device he controls with his eyes. He uses a feeding tube to eat. He can’t walk and uses a wheelchair that he drives with his head. His brain is smaller than average, his mother says. Unrelated to his CMV diagnosis, he also has Type 1 diabetes. Currently, he has a team of 18 doctors and medical professionals overseeing his care.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Kathleen Muldoon&lt;/p&gt; Kathleen and Gideon in March 2023&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overnight stays at Ryan House also allow Kathleen and her husband to travel for work, like when she went to Madagascar to study lemurs. But she's also had to turn down dream jobs out of state because the jobs were in other states which didn't have a place like Ryan House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The facility also allows the couple to focus on their marriage and their relationship. Sometimes they take long weekends to reconnect with each other; they are proud of the fact that they recently celebrated their 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; wedding anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no way that I could be fully present in my career and my family without a respite home like Ryan House,” says Kathleen, who serves on the board of &lt;a href="https://care4thecaregivers.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Care 4 the Caregivers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Care 4 the Caregivers&lt;/a&gt;, a program dedicated to supporting caregiver mental health. “It wouldn’t be possible.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/respite-facility-medical-needs-give-caregivers-a-break-exclusive-11839325" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2025 09:44:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOTzA3bk43R0t0cnZ2ZngxeVBYSGczSjI1N0d5Qi1ZMlNHSjFxMTZ5WlppMmVESnJjM0pBSlp0ZjJJak1kNjdRMmFPWnZZNFJjeUR6QkpnNjVJYjl1OW5EXzRYQUllNXdkZ3MtU2l6cHA5djAxT2JySFlBYVYwVzlicUdSVDI</guid></item><item><title>班加罗尔肝移植外科医生分享6种预防肝癌的生活方式选择： “保持健康的体重” |健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/bengaluru-liver-transplant-surgeon-shares-6-lifestyle-choices-to-prevent-liver-cancer-maintain-healthy-body-weight-101761985633276.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/bengaluru-liver-transplant-surgeon-shares-6-lifestyle-choices-to-prevent-liver-cancer-maintain-healthy-body-weight-101761985633276.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Liver cancer is emerging as one of India’s fastest-growing health concerns.

In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Basant Mahadevappa, consultant liver transplant surgeon and Hepato-Biliary, HCG Cancer Centre, KR Road, Bengaluru, highlighted 6 healthy life choices that can reduce liver cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Dr Basant, because liver cancer progresses silently, its symptoms often appear in the later, more advanced stages of the disease. "Raising awareness and understanding its &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/doctor-explains-why-brain-aneurysms-could-be-life-threatening-shares-risk-factors-amidst-kim-kardashians-diagnosis-101761391929817.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="risk factors"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt; is the first step toward prevention, empowering individuals and families to make informed choices that support long-term liver health," he emphasised.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2022/02/01/550x309/FKEEhB7XoAEeB5v_1643718836528_1643718846485.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Liver cancer progresses silently, its symptoms often appear in the later, more advanced stages of the disease.

(Twitter/AHealthyBod)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why focus on lifestyle prevention?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Liver cancer (primarily hepatocellular carcinoma) often develops over years, typically when the liver is under chronic stress. By the time symptoms appear, the disease is often advanced. In India, chronic hepatitis B remains a leading risk, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rising rapidly. Because many causes are modifiable, prevention through lifestyle holds powerful promise: reducing viral infections, curbing alcohol damage, managing weight and metabolic health, limiting toxin exposure, and early medical surveillance," Dr Basant highlighted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6 key healthy lifestyle choices to prevent liver cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the healthy lifestyle measures Dr Basant suggested:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Vaccination and prevention of hepatitis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A single shot can be a shield. The hepatitis B vaccine, available free through the Universal Immunisation Programme, blocks a virus that fuels most liver cancer cases in India. Infants and unvaccinated adults alike need this guard. Screening for hepatitis B and C, as advised by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, detects infections early, allowing treatments to halt the progression of damage," Dr Basant noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Safe practices, like using sterilised needles and protected intimacy, further lock out these viruses. For parents, this means securing family health with a visit to the local clinic —a small step with a lifelong impact, he suggested.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Limit or avoid alcohol consumption&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the surgeon, "Alcohol is a slow poison for the liver, etching scars that invite cancer. The Operational Guidelines for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease warn that even occasional binges strain this organ. Instead of toasting at gatherings, sip lemon juice or coconut water, which is refreshing and gentle on the liver." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/01/original/liver_cancer_1761988414727.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="6 lifestyle choices to prevent liver cancer. (Generated via Google Gemini)" title="6 lifestyle choices to prevent liver cancer. (Generated via Google Gemini)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;6 lifestyle choices to prevent liver cancer. (Generated via Google Gemini)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Maintain a healthy body weight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extra weight burdens the liver with fat, a stepping stone to cancer. "A diet rich in fibre, think millets, oats, and vibrant veggies like spinach and carrots, keeps fat at bay. Swap sugary colas and fried pakoras for fruit chaat or roasted makhana. Daily walks or yoga sessions, like a calming Surya Namaskar, burn fat while lifting spirits," Dr Basant suggested.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Avoid aflatoxin exposure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aflatoxins, toxic moulds in grains like maize or peanuts, sneak into poorly stored foods, silently raising cancer risks. The Indian Council of Medical Research emphasises the importance of safe storage: keep grains in dry, airtight containers and purchase from trusted vendors. Check for mouldy smells before cooking. For caregivers, this is about vigilance, ensuring the dal-rice on the table is as safe as it is hearty, protecting the liver one meal at a time," the surgeon explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Quit smoking and avoid harmful chemicals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smoking, whether bidis or cigarettes, fuels liver damage with every puff, per the National Tobacco Control Programme. Quitting is tough but possible. Additionally, the surgeon recommends, "Avoiding chemicals like those found in harsh cleaners or pesticides, which are common in homes, adds another layer of care. For parents, a smoke-free, toxin-light home is a gift, ensuring kids breathe easy and livers stay strong."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Regular health check-ups and liver screening&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, he highlights that early detection saves lives. "Annual liver function tests and ultrasounds, recommended by the NPCDCS framework, spot trouble before it grows. High-risk families, those with a history of hepatitis or heavy drinking, benefit most. Make check-ups a family ritual. A quick blood test can reveal what eyes can’t, keeping the liver’s quiet work uninterrupted," he adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Supporting habits for liver health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond these pillars, Dr Basant suggests small habits to fortify the liver, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drinking ample water or tulsi tea to flush toxins, as advised by the Ministry of Health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sleep 7 hours every night and manage stress with deep breathing or meditation; overworked livers need rest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular exercise, even a brisk evening stroll, boosts liver function, tying all efforts together.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These acts, simple yet profound, build a fortress of wellness," Dr Basant added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Understanding liver cancer risk factors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liver cancer doesn’t appear overnight; it brews from years of strain, the surgeon noted. "The National Viral Hepatitis Control Programme highlights hepatitis B and C as leading triggers, silently inflaming the liver until scars form, paving the way for cancer," Dr Basant added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, alcohol, even in modest amounts, scars the liver into cirrhosis, which is a risky precursor, as noted in the Operational Guidelines for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease. "Obesity and diabetes, increasingly common in urban India, pile on fat that chokes the liver, per the Indian Council of Medical Research. Aflatoxins, toxins in poorly stored grains like peanuts, lurk in pantries, while smoking adds a carcinogenic sting. These risks, though daunting, are not destiny. Understanding them empowers families to act, turning worry into wisdom," he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Protecting the liver is protecting Life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liver cancer is not inevitable. It is preventable when families take simple, consistent steps toward healthier living. "The liver has a remarkable ability to heal and regenerate when treated with care. By making mindful choices every day, vaccination against hepatitis B, eating wholesome meals, staying active, managing stress, and getting regular check-ups, you protect not only your own health but also the well-being of those who depend on you," the surgeon added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

time in hospital but she says doctors did everything they could to treat her symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Now 35 and cancer-free Kat, who lives in Edinburgh, had hoped to

							&lt;p data-start="381" data-end="702"&gt;I’ve watched my parents navigate their seventies with a mix of grace, humor, and humility. My dad still gets up early to walk along the beach, binoculars in hand, scanning the treetops for birds. My mum still laughs loudly, cooks meals that could feed an army, and worries endlessly about whether everyone’s eaten enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="704" data-end="792"&gt;But the thing that stands out most isn’t what they do—it’s what they’ve &lt;em data-start="776" data-end="792"&gt;stopped doing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="794" data-end="1024"&gt;Staying young, I’ve realized, isn’t about supplements or perfect diets. It’s about subtracting what no longer serves you. Here are eight habits my parents—and many other vibrant people in their seventies—have learned to let go of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="1031" data-end="1071"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1035" data-end="1071"&gt;1. Clinging to outdated routines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1073" data-end="1332"&gt;When my dad retired, he kept trying to fill his days the same way he used to: rigid schedules, early starts, and endless to-do lists. But after a few months, he realized something profound—he wasn’t working anymore, but he was still living like he had a boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1334" data-end="1544"&gt;He eventually traded routine for rhythm. Some days he wakes up early, some days he doesn’t. Some mornings he walks, others he reads the paper slowly over coffee. It’s a flexibility that lets life breathe again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1546" data-end="1712"&gt;If you want to stay young, you have to loosen your grip on the old patterns that once defined you. Growth in your seventies means embracing &lt;em data-start="1686" data-end="1692"&gt;flow&lt;/em&gt; instead of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-start="1714" data-end="1877"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1716" data-end="1877"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1716" data-end="1736"&gt;Mindfulness tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Try to start one day each week without a plan. Let the morning unfold naturally. See how your energy shifts when you stop forcing structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="1884" data-end="1926"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1888" data-end="1926"&gt;2. Dwelling on the “good old days”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1928" data-end="2126"&gt;There’s a fine line between nostalgia and regret. My mum loves to talk about the past—raising us, traveling, the chaos of three boys running around the house—but she’s careful not to romanticize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2128" data-end="2210"&gt;She once said, “If I keep looking backward, I’ll trip over what’s in front of me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2212" data-end="2390"&gt;People who stay young in their seventies don’t get trapped in the rearview mirror. They reflect, but they don’t &lt;em data-start="2324" data-end="2332"&gt;relive&lt;/em&gt;. They let the past nourish their present, not replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2392" data-end="2481"&gt;Aging gracefully means learning to love your memories without trying to live inside them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="2488" data-end="2528"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2492" data-end="2528"&gt;3. Saying “I’m too old for that”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2530" data-end="2578"&gt;This is the quiet death sentence of aging minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2580" data-end="2735"&gt;I’ve heard my parents say it before—when technology frustrates them or when someone suggests trying something new. But they’ve learned to catch themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2737" data-end="2953"&gt;A few months ago, my mum started learning Vietnamese phrases for when she visits us in Saigon. My dad joined a local photography group and began editing his photos on an iPad—something he once swore he’d never touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2955" data-end="3093"&gt;The truth is, your brain doesn’t stop learning unless &lt;em data-start="3009" data-end="3014"&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; stop feeding it. Youth isn’t measured in birthdays—it’s measured in curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-start="3095" data-end="3320"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3097" data-end="3320"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3097" data-end="3118"&gt;Buddhist insight:&lt;/strong&gt; In Zen, there’s a concept called &lt;em data-start="3152" data-end="3172"&gt;“beginner’s mind.”&lt;/em&gt; It means approaching everything as if for the first time—with openness, eagerness, and humility. It’s one of the best anti-aging mindsets there is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="3327" data-end="3360"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3331" data-end="3360"&gt;4. Neglecting friendships&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3362" data-end="3466"&gt;One of the biggest threats to vitality in your seventies isn’t physical decline—it’s &lt;em data-start="3447" data-end="3465"&gt;social isolation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3468" data-end="3658"&gt;I’ve seen this happen to friends of my parents who slowly drifted into solitude. The calls stopped, the lunches disappeared, and suddenly their world shrank to the size of their living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3660" data-end="3887"&gt;My parents made a conscious decision not to let that happen. They host casual dinners with old friends, go on group walks, and still send handwritten birthday cards. They’ve learned that friendship isn’t a luxury—it’s medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3889" data-end="4067"&gt;Research from Harvard’s decades-long study on adult development found that &lt;em data-start="3964" data-end="4067"&gt;the quality of your relationships is the single biggest predictor of happiness and health as you age.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4069" data-end="4187"&gt;If you want to stay young, stay connected. Even a five-minute chat with a friend can reignite your sense of belonging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="4194" data-end="4246"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4198" data-end="4246"&gt;5. Letting physical movement become optional&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4248" data-end="4381"&gt;Aging well isn’t about perfection—it’s about &lt;em data-start="4293" data-end="4301"&gt;motion&lt;/em&gt;. My dad often says, “The day you stop moving is the day you start getting old.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4383" data-end="4581"&gt;He doesn’t run marathons or lift weights. But he moves every day—walks, stretches, gardens, and climbs the stairs instead of taking the lift. It’s a habit that keeps both his body and mind flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4583" data-end="4739"&gt;Too many people in their seventies assume fatigue means they should rest more. But often, the opposite is true. The less you move, the less energy you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-start="4741" data-end="4939"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4743" data-end="4939"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4743" data-end="4764"&gt;Practical advice:&lt;/strong&gt; Aim for at least 30 minutes of gentle movement a day—walking, swimming, yoga, or even dancing in the living room. Movement is life’s quiet declaration that you’re still here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="4946" data-end="4999"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4950" data-end="4999"&gt;6. Trying to control what can’t be controlled&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5001" data-end="5029"&gt;This one hits close to home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5031" data-end="5174"&gt;My mum used to worry about everything—our careers, our health, the economy, the neighbors. She’d lose sleep over things far beyond her control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5176" data-end="5290"&gt;But somewhere along the way, she let it go. “I realized the world spins fine without me managing it,” she told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5292" data-end="5419"&gt;That surrender brought peace—and paradoxically, more energy. The weight of constant worry ages you faster than time ever could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5421" data-end="5522"&gt;Letting go of control doesn’t mean giving up—it means accepting that peace begins where control ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-start="5524" data-end="5856"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5526" data-end="5856"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5526" data-end="5543"&gt;Promote book:&lt;/strong&gt; I wrote about this in my book &lt;em data-start="5574" data-end="5652"&gt;Hidden Secrets of Buddhism: How to Live with Maximum Impact and Minimum Ego.&lt;/em&gt; One of the key teachings is that life’s richness doesn’t come from holding on tightly—it comes from loosening your grip. The moment you stop trying to control everything, life starts to unfold naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="5863" data-end="5897"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5867" data-end="5897"&gt;7. Ignoring new technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5899" data-end="5991"&gt;Staying young isn’t about chasing trends—it’s about staying &lt;em data-start="5959" data-end="5968"&gt;engaged&lt;/em&gt; with the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5993" data-end="6197"&gt;My parents once resisted smartphones, social media, and streaming services. But when they started using technology to connect—with family, news, and even YouTube tutorials—they became more mentally alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6199" data-end="6389"&gt;My dad sends us bird photos through WhatsApp now. My mum video calls my wife every week for cooking tips. These little connections keep them mentally sharp and emotionally plugged into life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6391" data-end="6546"&gt;You don’t have to understand every new app. Just stay curious enough to explore. Because every new skill learned is a small act of rebellion against aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="6553" data-end="6585"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6557" data-end="6585"&gt;8. Hiding behind comfort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6587" data-end="6759"&gt;There’s a strange trap that comes with age: the older we get, the more we try to protect ourselves from discomfort. We avoid change, challenge, and even mild inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6761" data-end="6805"&gt;But comfort, over time, becomes confinement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6807" data-end="7099"&gt;My parents could easily have stayed in their routines back in Australia—same house, same people, same grocery store. But they started traveling again in their seventies. They’ve visited us in Vietnam, explored Thailand, and even tried street food that would have terrified them ten years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7101" data-end="7272"&gt;Growth doesn’t stop when you turn seventy. It just gets quieter—more internal, more intentional. The people who stay vibrant don’t chase adrenaline—they chase &lt;em data-start="7260" data-end="7271"&gt;aliveness&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote data-start="7274" data-end="7361"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7276" data-end="7361"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="7276" data-end="7300"&gt;Reflection question:&lt;/strong&gt; When was the last time you did something for the first time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="7368" data-end="7415"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="7372" data-end="7415"&gt;The deeper truth: aging isn’t the enemy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7417" data-end="7475"&gt;Watching my parents age has changed how I see time itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7477" data-end="7632"&gt;They laugh more now. They stress less. They’ve both lost friends, but they’ve gained perspective. They don’t try to prove anything anymore—they just &lt;em data-start="7626" data-end="7632"&gt;are.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7634" data-end="7742"&gt;There’s a certain lightness that comes when you stop clinging to youth and start embracing vitality instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7744" data-end="7859"&gt;Youth is about &lt;em data-start="7759" data-end="7769"&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; life you have ahead of you. Vitality is about &lt;em data-start="7816" data-end="7827"&gt;how fully&lt;/em&gt; you live the life you have now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7861" data-end="7948"&gt;That’s what I see in my parents every day. Not a fight against age—but a dance with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="7955" data-end="7977"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="7959" data-end="7977"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7979" data-end="8113"&gt;If you’re in your seventies—or getting there—remember this: the habits you let go of will shape you just as much as the ones you keep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8115" data-end="8294"&gt;Say goodbye to rigidity, regret, and control. Say hello to curiosity, connection, and courage. Because staying young isn’t about looking young—it’s about keeping your heart awake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8296" data-end="8542"&gt;And if you want to explore this more deeply, my book &lt;em data-start="8349" data-end="8426"&gt;Hidden Secrets of Buddhism: How to Live with Maximum Impact and Minimum Ego&lt;/em&gt; dives into exactly that—how to live lightly, let go of ego, and discover the quiet strength that comes from within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8544" data-end="8636"&gt;My parents remind me every day that aging is just another word for &lt;em data-start="8611" data-end="8636"&gt;becoming more yourself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8638" data-end="8711"&gt;So, stay curious. Stay kind. Stay in motion.&lt;br data-start="8682" data-end="8685"&gt;That’s how you stay young.&lt;/p&gt;

Clinically, they have rewritten the playbook on weight loss. Economically, they have exposed a messy global truth that the same syringe can be a life-changing therapy in one country and an unaffordable luxury in another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The science: Why doctors are talking about them&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinical evidence is why these drugs rose from obscurity to headline status. Three trials stand out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;STEP-1, a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;2021 study in New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, tested weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg (the molecule in Wegovy) in adults with overweight or obesity. The result was striking as participants lost an average of roughly 15% of body weight in 68 weeks when semaglutide was combined with lifestyle support. That magnitude of weight loss, sustained over more than a year, transformed semaglutide from a diabetes medication into a proven medical weight-management tool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then came &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SURMOUNT-1, in a 2022 follow-up study by NEJM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which tested tirzepatide (Mounjaro) in people with obesity. Tirzepatide produced even larger and dose-dependent weight losses, with many participants losing more than 20% of their body weight, the results that were historically only bariatric surgery achieved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally, a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMoa2416394" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;May 2025 head-to-head trial published in NEJM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; compared tirzepatide with semaglutide directly. Tirzepatide produced greater mean weight loss and larger reductions in waist circumference than semaglutide over comparable time frames as a clinical confirmation of the dual-agonist’s potency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put simply, both drugs work very well. Tirzepatide seems to edge semaglutide on average weight loss while semaglutide has a deep track record (and cardiovascular outcome data) that keeps it in strong clinical favour. However, efficacy answers only half the question. The other half that who can actually access and afford these therapies, depends on geography, policy and patent clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Price maps: The same drug, different wallets&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with the Times of India, Dr Rajiv Kovil, Head of Diabetology and weight-loss expert at Zandra Healthcare, shared, “Prices for Ozempic, Mounjaro and Wegovy injectables change a lot depending on which part of the world you’re in.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

In Europe and the UK, prices are much lower — sometimes just one-tenth of the US cost — because the governments negotiate directly with companies. In India, the prices have been kept relatively lower to make them accessible to a larger number of people, though they’re still considered premium medications. So, if you compare globally: US — most expensive; UK and Europe — much cheaper; India — affordable but premium; Egypt, I believe, is the cheapest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Put another way -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United States:&lt;/strong&gt; High list prices and variable out-of-pocket costs.

Actual consumer cost is a function of dose, pack size, pharmacy, insurance coverage and manufacturer programs. It is a complexity that Dr Manjunath Malige, Director - Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes, Obesity and Weight Management at Sakra World Hospital in Bengaluru, emphasised, “Prices vary by dose, pack size, pharmacy, insurance, and manufacturer programs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Patent clocks and the near-term affordability story&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a practical reason why prices may fall in the near future. Dr Malige pointed to patent timelines and said, “Semaglutide will go out of patency in March 2026 — after that, leading Indian pharmaceutical companies will manufacture and market semaglutide, which will bring down the cost significantly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

When a molecule loses exclusivity, generics and biosimilars can enter the market, competition increases and prices usually fall, sometimes dramatically. For semaglutide, that could mean more affordable Wegovy/Ozempic-equivalents in markets like India and others where local manufacturers can scale production. Tirzepatide’s exclusivity timeline will similarly shape Mounjaro’s future affordability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, generic entry does not instantly make the drug cheap everywhere. Regulatory barriers, manufacturing complexity (these are injectables, not simple pills) and distribution logistics all affect how quickly prices drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for real people&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For readers wondering whether the science or the price should sway decisions, here is a practical take by experts -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your goal is diabetes control and modest weight loss, semaglutide formulations (Ozempic) remain a mainstream choice, supported by cardiovascular outcomes data and diabetes approvals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If maximal weight loss is the priority, tirzepatide (Mounjaro) shows larger average reductions in trials, an important consideration for those with severe obesity or weight-related comorbidities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If cost matters (and it does), geography and insurance dictate options. In the US, explore insurance formularies and manufacturer assistance. In countries with negotiated pricing or imminent generic competition, the calculus may be very different.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long-term therapy costs add up. These drugs usually require ongoing treatment to maintain weight loss. That is a financial and clinical commitment, not a one-time fix.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Efficacy is not everything, access is&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical advances here are real and profound but Dr Kovil reminded, “The same medicine can mean very different things to your wallet, depending on where you live.” Clinical breakthroughs only translate into population health gains when systems including insurers, governments, manufacturers and regulators, make access practical and sustainable. With patent expiries and rising political pressure on drug pricing, the next two years could reshape who gets to benefit from this new era of metabolic medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, if you are curious about these drugs, talk to your clinician, check coverage options and weigh both the potential benefits and the long-term cost before deciding. The science is dazzling. The money question is a lot less glamorous and it will likely decide who gets the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

It’s all about when and how you take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sudhir Kumar, also known as hyderabaddoctor, recently shared some advice that’s simple but can make a huge difference: Vitamin D is fat-soluble. Translation? Your body absorbs it way better when you take it with some fat, think milk, eggs, nuts, avocado, or anything with a bit of healthy fat. Take it on an empty stomach, and you could be losing up to 50% of its effectiveness. That’s basically like only getting half the benefits for your bones, muscles, and even immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Easy ways to increase your Vitamin D intake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what’s the trick? Dr. Kumar recommends taking your Vitamin D after your heaviest meal of the day. Not before breakfast, not as a random mid-morning tablet. Big meal, little vitamin, that’s the combo that actually works. The logic is simple: when Vitamin D travels with dietary fat, it’s absorbed efficiently into your bloodstream. Without that fat, your body struggles to process it, and all the effort of swallowing the pill could be wasted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one of those “tiny tweak, big payoff” moments in health. Think about it: a little timing shift and a simple pairing with food can make your supplement far more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, this has sparked reactions on social media. One user shared: “My mother was advised to take Vitamin D tablets on an empty stomach only.” Another chimed in: “And I saw a prescription from an MD doctor in Mumbai to take it before breakfast on an empty stomach. Doctors also need education and awareness.” People are starting to realize that even medical advice isn’t always aligned with the latest nutritional science, a little awareness can go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others pointed out the beauty of small changes: “Sometimes the biggest health boost comes from a tiny timing tweak,” wrote one user. And it’s true, most of us think about supplements purely in terms of quantity or brand, not timing or absorption. Yet this one adjustment, pairing it with fat and taking it with a main meal, could make your daily Vitamin D dose actually do what it’s supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter so much? Vitamin D isn’t just about strong bones. It plays a role in muscle function, immunity, mood regulation, and even cardiovascular health. Skipping proper absorption means you’re leaving a lot of those benefits on the table. For older adults, those at risk of osteoporosis, or anyone trying to maintain peak health, it’s literally a difference-maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here’s the takeaway: Next time you reach for your Vitamin D, pause for a second. What’s your meal situation? If it’s a light snack or you’re fasting, consider holding off until you have a meal with some fat. Milk with breakfast, avocado toast at lunch, or even a handful of nuts with dinner, these simple foods can boost your vitamin absorption dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And one more thing: consistency is key. Taking Vitamin D occasionally with a meal won’t hurt, but for true bone, muscle, and immune health benefits, make it a daily habit, right after your largest meal. Over time, your body will thank you, even if the change feels minor day to day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, health often comes down to these small, practical tweaks. You don’t always need the fanciest supplement or the highest dose. Sometimes it’s just about making sure your body can actually use what you’re giving it. Fat-soluble vitamins like D deserve a little thought, and now that you know the trick, you can get more from every single tablet you take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAJBVV95cUxQZF9QSml6aUlWcFYzbU5xcGdsU2cxS2lVWjJuTHloVzVlWERmZzF4UER4QXJ3Z2Zqd3p1X1V1ZlZydDhSYUpJM0xRbGdiMEcwZjlaYWFhRWRZSEc0bDBhMTNyUUJhTVhKckpFd0hMbjNDcU0zSDNWZVBDSV90V3pJZ1VYMTlEUXFDYTBlcDBTZHB3V2Z3ekNzbWFNY3BhaUgzTnJ5eF83SEN5cFJ4MGFJbnpwaXFYMWVlRlJNZV8wbDlZbVFfNFNZcm5yZ04tWW1wdTU4ZERoTDIxQnpJWUliMFBGUHA0c2lzVHV1b2ozaHJXWDU0NUxWMTNZUDhpcENOUW5wdjZWU2JCV05oMmppQ3VzRHNPWk5NZlBfLW1KUkVyb0E3dmxseW9sbnA</guid></item><item><title>新的麻疹病例使犹他州的总病例数达到64例- KSL.com</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51398776/new-measles-cases-bring-utahs-total-to-64</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — More than 60 Utah residents have now been diagnosed with the measles, according to the Utah Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department's dashboard, which was updated Friday afternoon, reports a total of 64 cases of measles &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;across the state&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said there have been seven new confirmed cases in the past three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the Utah County Health Department announced that a new case had been confirmed in its district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_12-what-to-know-about-measles-cases-outbreak-data" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Measles&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most contagious diseases, spreading through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms can include high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a characteristic rash that spreads over the body. People who are not vaccinated are at the greatest risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials in Utah say they are taking necessary measures to limit further spread&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We appreciate the cooperation of community members who have answered our calls, worked closely with our disease investigators, been tested when recommended, and followed isolation guidance," said Eric Edwards, executive director at the Utah County Health Department, in a statement. "These efforts are critical to protecting others and preventing additional cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent case brings the Utah County health district's total to eight, according to data on the Utah Department of Health and Human Services website. Utah's southwest health district has the state's highest number of measles cases, with 49 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Salt Lake County Health Department reported its first "probable" case of measles on Wednesday, but officials had been unable to confirm the diagnosis because the patient declined to participate in the investigation, a press release stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah's spike in measles cases comes amid a national outbreak. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_12-what-to-know-about-measles-cases-outbreak-data" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; reports a total of 1,648 confirmed cases throughout the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials urge those who suspect they may have been exposed to measles to contact their health care provider immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

Here’s what most people get wrong about bathroom phone time — and what to do instead.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Scrolling on the loo raises hemorrhoid risk by 46 percent.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults who use smartphones while on the toilet are 46 percent more likely to develop hemorrhoids, even when accounting for fibre intake, age, exercise, weight, and straining, the gastroenterologist highlighted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. You end up sitting WAY longer.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Sethi, 37 percent of smartphone users spend more than 5 minutes per toilet visit, compared to just 7.1 percent of non-users, and prolonged sitting raises pressure on anal tissues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Linger less, risk less.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Spending over five minutes per bathroom visit increases hemorrhoid risk, even more than straining,” the gut doctor pointed out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. The pelvic floor gets no backup.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unlike chairs or couches, toilet seats offer no support to your pelvic floor,” the gastroenterologist stressed. Therefore, without that support, prolonged sitting increases pressure on hemorrhoidal cushions, which can be harmful in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/01/original/hemorrhoids_1761966910132.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Why not to use your phone in the toilet!(Made using ChatGPT)" title="Why not to use your phone in the toilet!(Made using ChatGPT)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Why not to use your phone in the toilet!(Made using ChatGPT)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Your apps are built to trap your attention.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Scrolling the news or social media tricks your brain into losing track of time, making bathroom breaks longer without you even realising it,” Dr Sethi wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Hemorrhoids are no joke.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 50-66 percent of people experience hemorrhoids in their lifetime, the gastroenterologist highlighted. These patients account for nearly 4 million US medical visits and over $800 million in annual healthcare costs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Keep it short: 5 minutes max.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Dr Sethi shared a hack, saying, “Bathroom breaks should be under 5 minutes. A ‘two TikTok limit’ is a cheeky but useful rule to follow. Your gut (and bottom) deserves better. Leave the phone. Save your time. Save your tush.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

&lt;p&gt;That has become a challenge for pediatricians and specialists who caution that the science on leucovorin in people with autism is limited and does not support widespread use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the month since Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary promoted the decades-old drug from GSK, saying it could help “hundreds of thousands” of children with autism, doctors and researchers say they have been inundated by parents seeking information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My Facebook feed is flooded with parents swearing that leucovorin works,” said Dr. David Mandell, a professor of psychiatry and autism researcher at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of people have joined a Facebook group called Leucovorin for Autism, started in May by Keith Joyce, legal guardian to four-year-old Jose, who is taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joyce credits Jose’s improvements in verbal communication and social awareness to leucovorin. The site gained 5,000 members on the day of Trump and Makary’s White House announcement and now has 84,000.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mandell and other scientists and doctors say FDA’s endorsement without requiring large, randomized clinical trials leaves practitioners facing emotional pleas from families while lacking data, guidance or confidence to prescribe the drug responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leucovorin is approved to treat chemotherapy side effects but can be prescribed off-label for autism symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It puts physicians in a very tough position because they’re being asked to prescribe something that is not evidence-based,” said Dr. Shafali Jeste, an autism expert and head of pediatrics at UCLA, who does not prescribe leucovorin despite repeated requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics today said it does not recommend leucovorin for routine use in children with autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism rates have risen to 1 in 31 8-year-olds, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in April. Finding the condition’s root cause and potential treatments is something Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Trump have championed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the FDA commissioner’s broad comments, his agency proposed a narrower expanded approval tied to cerebral folate deficiency (CFD), a genetic condition that can cause autism-like symptoms. It affects roughly one in 1 million children worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument for wider use is built on small studies suggesting many children with autism have autoantibodies that block folate — a vitamin important for brain signaling — from entering the brain, causing a deficiency similar to CFD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An estimated 75% of autistic children are believed to have these autoantibodies, but their significance is unproven, said Dr. Karam Radwan, director of the Neurodevelopmental Disorders Program at the University of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Health and Human Services spokesperson said the FDA based its plan to update the leucovorin label to include CFD on an analysis of over 40 case studies published from 2009 to 2024. Overall, 85% of patients experienced some benefit, including improved speech/communication capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HHS said leucovorin could be useful in children who have autoantibodies to folate, but conceded “the data are limited and need to be replicated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson said the National Institutes of Health will support follow-up research into leucovorin’s impact on CFD, as well as any potential benefit to individuals with autism. Post-market surveillance and safety studies are part of the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents have interpreted the FDA announcement as a green light for leucovorin’s use in autism, sharing treatment tips that led Facebook to take down Joyce’s site. It was reinstated with rules banning dosing discussions, only to be removed again last week for other violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joyce started researching the drug after watching a news program featuring a boy with autism on the treatment who showed marked speech improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He found just three studies, all by the same author, that he deemed credible. No large trials in autistic children comparing leucovorin to a placebo have been conducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joyce reviewed the drug’s track record in cancer patients, where leucovorin has been linked with insomnia, agitation and depression. In children, doctors and parents say it can lead to hyperactivity, aggression and feeling overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jose’s neurologist balked at prescribing leucovorin, but the boy’s behavioral pediatrician, who heard about the drug at a conference, was willing to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The child’s care team measured language skills before treatment and four months later, Joyce said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is more aware of the world around him, and more responsive, Joyce said. “It’s not curing his autism, but it improved his quality of life. I’m convinced it’s real.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radwan, who offers the drug in his practice, said doctors don’t fully understand who may benefit, by how much and whether it is sustainable. So far, the benefit is “pretty modest,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents in some online communities are calling for caution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sophia Urwin, 33, a single parent from Wellington, New Zealand, whose four-year-old, non-verbal son was diagnosed with autism in 2022, is concerned about desperate parents turning to over-the-counter versions of folinic acid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s really easy to get swept up in thinking something is a miracle ‘cure’ when you’ve been skating on thin ice for so long,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Honolulu Star-Advertiser</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2025 02:51:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQTlg5ei0xQ3ZCUGNxaWhhYjNEbVYzdHltTENwX3JrUUMtelluYW1PV1J3OVFHcXB5dEw1dzFlYTRFVmJaMkRfU0ttaDhwX1hvR1BGZU9EbVdGR2s1WmhVY3VpU1hiM19TQy03YUhyemd0SGl4UzJXMW9SdVU5MmpnTVpqT3JfT3Z2ZTJ2cHhDSDlUQ3lqU3B1ZzA4NmVYS1lSWXYzdGFsSjR1WktZTnRYclBoSG03Zw</guid></item><item><title>当我的女儿得到改变生活的诊断时，我一遍又一遍地听到同样的短语。我永远不会对其他人重复。- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/maggiekangmd/daughter-diagnosed-neuromyelitis-optica-grief?origin=web-hf</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;I had just stepped out of the shower when my husband, Scott, called from the hospital, where our 9-year-old daughter had been a patient in the pediatric ICU for four weeks. He had relieved me that morning so I could go home, shower and return for a meeting with the doctors about our daughter’s condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he told me our daughter’s diagnosis was “neuromyelitis optica,” a rare autoimmune disease that attacks the central nervous system, my heart didn’t just sink. It stopped. A silent, internal arrest. In a single moment, my physician’s mind ran through the prognosis. Rare, incurable, potentially fatal. My heart broke under the weight of my devastation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steam still hung in the air, my wet hair dripped as I clutched the towel around me, my skin still damp. When the words came through the phone, my legs gave way.  I slid down the wall until I was sitting on the cold bathroom tile, the phone pressed to my ear, my breath caught in my chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott asked if I was still on the phone. “It’s good we finally have a diagnosis,” he said, searching for a foothold of hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a long silence, I whispered: “That’s not a good diagnosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a physician, I knew exactly what this diagnosis meant: Not only was it incurable; it often led to blindness, paralysis and ongoing hospitalizations.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a month ago, our daughter Nell had woken up one morning with nausea, dizziness and overwhelming fatigue. When I took her to the emergency room, her symptoms escalated rapidly. She became unresponsive, and a brain MRI revealed multiple large areas of inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her neurological status declined, her tongue and the other muscles involved in swallowing became paralyzed. Because she couldn’t clear her oral secretions, she developed aspiration pneumonia and was admitted to the ICU, where she developed right upper extremity paralysis and lower extremity weakness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She remained in the ICU for five weeks, hooked up to beeping monitors and struggling to recover from what appeared to be a pediatric stroke. The diagnosis was made a few weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contrast between the recent memories of my daughter powering down the lacrosse field, her face lit up with joy after scoring a goal, and now seeing her lying in the ICU was stark. She was unresponsive, her face pale, her little body wired with tubes and monitors. The sound of machines beeping echoed where there once had been giggles. &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;A measles investigation amid a large, ongoing outbreak at the Arizona-Utah border has hit a roadblock as the first probable case identified in the Salt Lake City area refuses to work with health officials, the local health department reported this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been over 150 cases collectively across the two states, mostly in northwestern Mohave County, &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, and the southwest health district of &lt;a href="https://avrpublic.dhhs.utah.gov/uwss/"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;, in the past two months. Both areas have abysmally low vaccination rates: In Mohave County, only &lt;a href="https://apps.azdhs.gov/IDRREportStats"&gt;78.4 percent of kindergartners&lt;/a&gt; in the 2024–2025 school year were vaccinated against measles, according to state records. In the southwest district of Utah, &lt;a href="https://immunize-training.at.utah.gov/captivate/UtahSchoolsData_Kinder_UpdatedApr2025.html"&gt;only 80.7 percent&lt;/a&gt; of kindergartners in the 2024–2025 school year had records of measles vaccination. Public health experts say vaccination coverage of 95 percent is necessary to keep the disease from spreading in a community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the outbreak has largely exploded along the border, cases are also creeping to the north, toward Salt Lake County, which encompasses the city. Utah County, which sits just south of Salt Lake County, has identified eight cases, including &lt;a href="https://health.utahcounty.gov/2025/10/31/new-measles-case-in-utah-county/"&gt;a new case reported today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Uncooperative case&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salt Lake County likely has a new one, too—the first for the county this year—as well as possible exposures. But, they can’t confirm it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;County health officials said that a health care provider in the area contacted them late on Monday to tell them about a patient who very likely has measles. The officials then spent a day reaching out to the person, who refused to answer questions or cooperate in any way. That included refusing to share location information so that other people could be notified that they were potentially exposed to one of the most infectious viruses known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The patient has declined to be tested, or to fully participate in our disease investigation, so we will not be able to technically confirm the illness or properly do contact tracing to warn anyone with whom the patient may have had contact,” Dorothy Adams, executive director of Salt Lake County Health Department, said in &lt;a href="https://www.saltlakecounty.gov/health/news/probable-first-case-of-measles-in-salt-lake-county/"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “But based on the specific symptoms reported by the healthcare provider and the limited conversation our investigators have had with the patient, this is very likely a case of measles in someone living in Salt Lake County.”&lt;/p&gt;

Using electrical recordings in animals, the team found that neurons in the prefrontal cortex synchronize in circular patterns—like starlings in flight—to recover from cognitive interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When this rotation completed a full circle, performance stayed sharp; when it fell short, mistakes followed. The findings suggest that the brain uses these energy-efficient traveling waves as a natural analog computation system to restore concentration after disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rotational Recovery:&lt;/strong&gt; Rotating neural waves in the prefrontal cortex help the brain recover focus after distraction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Power:&lt;/strong&gt; Full circular rotations correlated with correct task performance; incomplete ones predicted errors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analog Efficiency:&lt;/strong&gt; The study suggests the brain uses analog-like traveling waves to perform computations efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Picower Institute at MIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As surely as the brain is prone to distraction, it can also return its focus to the task at hand. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study in animals by scientists at The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory of MIT shows how that seems to happen: Coordinated neural activity in the form of a rotating brain wave puts thought back on track. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The rotating waves act like herders that steer the cortex back to the correct computational path,” said study senior author Earl K. Miller, Picower Professor in The Picower Institute and MIT’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picower Institute postdoc Tamal Batabyal is the lead author of the study published Nov. 3 in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mathematical ‘rotations’…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, animals were given a visual working memory task, but sometimes they experienced one of two different kinds of distractions while they tried to remember an object they saw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one would expect, the distractions affected the animals’ performance on the task—sometimes causing them to make mistakes or at least slowing down their reaction time when the task called on them to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers, meanwhile, kept tabs on the electrical activity of a sampling of hundreds of neurons in the prefrontal cortex, a brain region responsible for higher-level cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To analyze how the neural activity varied as the animals performed the task over hundreds of sessions—with or without either of the distractions and in cases where the animals performed well or not so well—the researchers employed a mathematical measure and visualization that measures their degree of coordination over time called “subspace coding.”  Subspace coding shows that the activity of cortical neurons is highly coordinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Like starlings murmuring in the sky,” Miller said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the distraction, there was a rotating movement in subspace, as if the “birds” were circling back together after a disruption of their formation.  In other words, Miller said, the circling seemed to represent the recovery of their activity state from the distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the rotations predicted the animal’s performance on the task. In cases where the distraction didn’t cause a mistake, the neural data showed a complete circle, indicating the recovery was complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cases where the distractions caused the animals to err, the trajectory fell short of making a full circle (by an average of 30 degrees). The trajectory during errant sessions showed a slower speed, which could explain the lack of recovery from distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A related finding was that the animals were better at recovering if the time between the distraction and needing to act was longer. The brain needed that time, the data showed, to come full circle mathematically and get back on track behaviorally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subspace coding data suggested that neurons work in a highly coordinated way and that this rotational organization helps maintain their focus. Notably, the rotations only occurred if there was a distraction (both styles triggered them) that the animals were trying to ignore.  The rotations did not occur spontaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;…reflect physical rotations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subspace coding is just an abstract mathematical representation of neural activity over time. But when the researchers looked at the direct physical measurements of neural activity, they found that it actually reflected a real, traveling wave rotating across the cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple measurements showed that neural spiking activity had a spatial order with continuously changing angles, consistent with a wave of activity rotating across the cortical electrode. In fact, the actual wave rotated with the same speed as the mathematically represented one in subspace coding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no reason in principle why a rotation in this mathematical subspace should correspond directly to a rotation on the surface of the cortex,” Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it does. That suggests to me that the brain is using these traveling waves to actually do computation, analog computation.  Analog computation is way more energy efficient than digital and biology favors energy efficient solutions.  It’s a different, and more natural, way to think about neural computation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Miller and Batabyal, the paper’s other authors are Scott Brincat, Jacob Donoghue, Mikael Lundqvist and Meredith Mahnke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Funding for the study came from the Office of Naval Research, The Simons Center for the Social Brain, the Freedom Together Foundation and The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761936076689"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; What happens in the brain when attention returns after distraction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Coordinated rotating waves sweep across the cortex, realigning neurons into a focused state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761936078541"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; How do these rotations relate to behavior?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; When the rotations fully complete, performance improves; incomplete rotations lead to errors or slower responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1761936078494"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; Why does this matter for understanding brain function?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; It shows that the brain uses analog-like traveling waves—an efficient mechanism—to restore attention and process information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#157174637c717f7a55787c613b707160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;David Orenstein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mit.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Picower Institute at MIT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;David Orenstein – Picower Institute at MIT&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1162/JOCN.a.2410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;State–Space Trajectories and Traveling Waves Following Distraction&lt;/a&gt;” by Earl K.

We analyzed neural activity from the pFC of monkeys performing working memory tasks with mid-memory delay distractions (a cued gaze shift or an irrelevant visual input).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After distraction, there were state–space rotational dynamics that returned spiking to population patterns similar to those predisruption. In fact, rotations were fuller when the task was performed correctly versus when errors were made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found a correspondence between state–space rotations and traveling waves across the surface of pFC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests a role for emergent dynamics like state–space rotations and traveling waves in recovery from distractions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 19:21:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBPQ1hXckRKeC1ZZVJRM1pJQWNqS3FUSFEwSm5JTVBXa2VlOUtfVGZxemw3dGZ2eVp3RUJxZVBGTWFRRUVLQmhPQVh4VzZYcGxZVHZNQ0trOWM2N3hiVENxNEpRSi1WLTRSM0l0RnpFWDllV09T</guid></item><item><title>根据牙医的说法，最有效的口腔干燥治疗- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/dry-mouth-treatment-rcna241165</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b51164" class="body-graf"&gt;Do you wake up in the middle of the night and need to drink water? Or notice that your mouth constantly feels like it’s filled with cotton balls? You might have dry mouth (a.k.a. xerostomia), an oral health condition that causes reduced saliva flow, leading to symptoms like a burning sensation, rapid tooth decay, uncontrolled cavities, bad breath, altered taste and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-350fe0" class="body-graf"&gt;Dry mouth is quite common — it affects about one in five people, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10902-dry-mouth-xerostomia" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s under-diagnosed because often, people who experience it mistakenly think they’re dehydrated, says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.drmaddahi.com/about/meet-dr-maddahi/" target="_blank"&gt;Kourosh Maddahi&lt;/a&gt;, a dentist at Dion Health in California and the founder and CEO of &lt;a href="https://lumineuxhealth.com" target="_blank"&gt;Lumineux&lt;/a&gt;.

It can be caused by medications, mouth breathing, radiation treatment and tobacco and cannabis use, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-29a8e3" class="body-graf"&gt;To fully understand why dry mouth can be so damaging to your oral health, it’s important to understand the important roles saliva plays in the mouth. As a natural antibiotic, it’s the mouth’s first line of defense against cavity-causing bacteria, and it also acts as a lubricant to prevent abrasion, and cleans plaque and other particles off teeth, says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/pres/governance/lloyd-bio.php" target="_blank"&gt;Patrick Lloyd&lt;/a&gt;, the dean of the Stony Brook University School of Dental Medicine. Saliva also remineralizes tooth enamel (teeth’s hard outer layer) since it has calcium and phosphate, which make teeth more resistant to decay. Another crucial function of saliva is to neutralize acids, says Lloyd. When the bacteria in your mouth break down sugars, they produce acids that can weaken enamel. Saliva neutralizes these acids to prevent them from damaging your teeth, and helps your mouth maintain a balanced pH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-35621e" class="body-graf"&gt;All that said, if dry mouth isn’t managed and you constantly don’t have enough saliva in your mouth, it can lead to rampant cavities, bad breath, difficulty swallowing, mouth sores, poor taste and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/dry-mouth-treatment-rcna241165?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=exchange&amp;amp;tblci=GiAM-FfQ5ZAs24MpB2Ckh-QyK3yDVHEH-yWi7OnNdFAQNCCU3j0ozI2ezbiJooBnMNL2Rw#anchor-b580ba" id="anchor-b580ba" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;How do you treat dry mouth?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-99e92c" class="body-graf"&gt;If you’re concerned about dry mouth, first see your dentist. They’ll examine your mouth, looking for the appropriate amount and consistency of saliva, as well as signs of decay, says Messina. Then, they’ll help you develop a treatment plan, which often consists of using over-the-counter products to alleviate symptoms, like &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-mouthwashes-rcna190988" target="_blank"&gt;mouthwashes&lt;/a&gt;, gels, chewing gums and lozenges. While these products temporarily relieve symptoms associated with dry mouth, they have limitations. They don’t address the underlying cause of the condition, completely prevent issues like tooth decay, and also not long-term solutions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4151cc" class="body-graf"&gt;Treating dry mouth also involves making lifestyle changes, like cutting back on certain food and drinks (more on that in the FAQs section below). If you have severe dry mouth that will likely cause recurring dental issues, your dentist may prescribe a concentrated &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/fluoride-free-toothpaste-rcna189650" target="_blank"&gt;fluoride&lt;/a&gt; gel or &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-toothpastes-ncna1294664" target="_blank"&gt;toothpaste&lt;/a&gt;, which helps make teeth more resistant to decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/dry-mouth-treatment-rcna241165?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=exchange&amp;amp;tblci=GiAM-FfQ5ZAs24MpB2Ckh-QyK3yDVHEH-yWi7OnNdFAQNCCU3j0ozI2ezbiJooBnMNL2Rw#anchor-be7886" id="anchor-be7886" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;How I picked the best dry mouth treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3f4fb5" class="body-graf"&gt;Here’s what dentists recommend I consider while shopping for dry mouth treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-9f7f77" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saliva substitute v.s. stimulant: &lt;/strong&gt;Saliva&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;substitutes act as a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/100-best-face-moisturizers-rcna151958" target="_blank"&gt;moisturizer&lt;/a&gt; for your mouth, alleviating the dry, sticky, burning sensation that’s typically associated with the condition. They’re not as effective as natural human saliva, but they work well enough, dentists told me. Saliva stimulants, on the other hand, activate the taste buds, sending a signal to the brain that it needs to tell the salivary glands to make more saliva, says Lloyd. Many treatments are both saliva substitutes and stimulants, while some are one or the other — I have all types on this list. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;: Dry mouth treatments are available as mouthwashes, sprays, dissolvable tablets, gels, chewing gums and more. One is not better than the other — it’s entirely a matter of personal preference, so try a few and see what works for you. Some treatments also lend themselves better to at-home use versus on the go use, and vice versa. I recommend various treatment types below so you can compare them and decide which you might like best.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: Avoid products made with alcohol and sugar if you have dry mouth as they can worsen the condition. For example, choose alcohol-free mouthwashes and sugar-free gum and lozenges. Over-the-counter dry mouth treatments are commonly made with xylitol, a sugar substitute that the mouth bacteria doesn’t feed on, so it doesn’t cause cavities while stimulating saliva production, says Messina. All the products on this list are sugar-free and alcohol-free, and many are made with xylitol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADA Seal of Acceptance&lt;/strong&gt;: Dental products that earn the &lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/resources/research/science/ada-seal-of-acceptance" target="_blank"&gt;American Dental Association’s Seal of Acceptance&lt;/a&gt; are independently evaluated by the organization to ensure they’re safe and effective, says Messina. That doesn’t mean products without the Seal aren’t worth using — it just means brands haven’t voluntarily submitted them to be reviewed. I prioritized ADA-accepted products while recommending the dry mouth treatments below, but the options are limited.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/dry-mouth-treatment-rcna241165?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=exchange&amp;amp;tblci=GiAM-FfQ5ZAs24MpB2Ckh-QyK3yDVHEH-yWi7OnNdFAQNCCU3j0ozI2ezbiJooBnMNL2Rw#anchor-547b98" id="anchor-547b98" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;The best dry mouth treatments of 2025&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8d52a6" class="body-graf"&gt;Below, I rounded up dry mouth treatments that are available over the counter that meet dentists’ guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/dry-mouth-treatment-rcna241165?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=exchange&amp;amp;tblci=GiAM-FfQ5ZAs24MpB2Ckh-QyK3yDVHEH-yWi7OnNdFAQNCCU3j0ozI2ezbiJooBnMNL2Rw#anchor-3bb9b4" id="anchor-3bb9b4" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Best mouthwash&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-62f3a0"&gt;&lt;div id="rcpd63417" class="" data-testid="article-product-unit"&gt;&lt;div class="listicleProduct dn-print  product__grid-container--small" data-activity-map="listicle-product-article-body-bioténe-dry-mouth-oral-rinse" data-testid="product-container"&gt;&lt;div class="product__grid-row"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_accordion__Z2nEy styles_accordion__Coahi undefined styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion" data-title="What to know"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="styles_accordion__content__09JIS styles_accordion__content__9AV2h styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion__content" role="listbox" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsContainer__HAJ1f" data-testid="listicle-product__pros-cons-container" data-activity-map="product-article-body-bioténe-dry-mouth-oral-rinse"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;What we like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;ADA-accepted&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relieves symptoms for ∾4 hrs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Freshens breath&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-084ec7" class="body-graf"&gt;Instead of drinking water when your mouth feels dry, use a hydrating mouthrinse, says Maddahi. Bioténe’s, which earned the ADA’s Seal of Acceptance, stops dry mouth symptoms for up to four hours by soothing, lubricating and moisturizing. It also can help stimulate saliva production since it’s made with xylitol. The mouthwash’s minty flavor freshens breath, and it helps your mouth maintain a balanced pH, too — the mouth’s pH becomes more acidic due to a lack of saliva, which neutralizes acids, according to the dentists I talked to. The brand recommends swishing it around in your mouth for about 30 seconds before spitting it out, and says you can use it up to five times a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/dry-mouth-treatment-rcna241165?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=exchange&amp;amp;tblci=GiAM-FfQ5ZAs24MpB2Ckh-QyK3yDVHEH-yWi7OnNdFAQNCCU3j0ozI2ezbiJooBnMNL2Rw#anchor-38f594" id="anchor-38f594" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Best dissolvable tablets&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-86086f"&gt;&lt;div id="rcpd63422" class="" data-testid="article-product-unit"&gt;&lt;div class="listicleProduct dn-print  product__grid-container--small" data-activity-map="listicle-product-article-body-oracoat-xylimelts-for-dry-mouth" data-testid="product-container"&gt;&lt;div class="product__grid-row"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_accordion__Z2nEy styles_accordion__Coahi undefined styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion" data-title="What to know"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="styles_accordion__content__09JIS styles_accordion__content__9AV2h styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion__content" role="listbox" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsContainer__HAJ1f" data-testid="listicle-product__pros-cons-container" data-activity-map="product-article-body-oracoat-xylimelts-for-dry-mouth"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;What we like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relieves symptoms for ∾8 hrs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can use overnight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neutralizes acids in mouth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;Something to note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Application may take practice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e6a5f2" class="body-graf"&gt;These dissolvable tablets can relieve dry mouth symptoms for up to eight hours, according to the brand. You place a tablet on one or both sides of the mouth outside of a molar, putting the tan side against your gum and the white side against your teeth. Move it into a comfortable spot with your tongue, and then don’t touch it — it will start to adhere to your gums so it stays in place. The tablet slowly releases xylitol to lubricate the mouth and stimulate saliva production throughout the day, or you can apply it for overnight relief. XyliMelts are also made with calcium carbonate, an ingredient that helps prevent plaque and tooth decay, according to the brand. They can neutralize acids, too, preventing tooth damage like weakened enamel. The tablets come in three flavors: cinnamon, mild mint and slightly sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/dry-mouth-treatment-rcna241165?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=exchange&amp;amp;tblci=GiAM-FfQ5ZAs24MpB2Ckh-QyK3yDVHEH-yWi7OnNdFAQNCCU3j0ozI2ezbiJooBnMNL2Rw#anchor-55d3a2" id="anchor-55d3a2" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Best lozenges&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-013cf3"&gt;&lt;div id="rcpd63423" class="" data-testid="article-product-unit"&gt;&lt;div class="listicleProduct dn-print  product__grid-container--small" data-activity-map="listicle-product-article-body-act-dry-mouth-lozenges" data-testid="product-container"&gt;&lt;div class="product__grid-row"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_accordion__Z2nEy styles_accordion__Coahi undefined styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion" data-title="What to know"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="styles_accordion__content__09JIS styles_accordion__content__9AV2h styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion__content" role="listbox" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsContainer__HAJ1f" data-testid="listicle-product__pros-cons-container" data-activity-map="product-article-body-act-dry-mouth-lozenges"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;What we like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comes in 2 flavors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Freshens breath&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;Something to note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nothing to note at this time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0ff6b2" class="body-graf"&gt;If the tablets above sound like a hassle to apply, or you don’t love the idea of them staying in your mouth for hours, lozenges for dry mouth are another option you can try.

CariFree’s Oral Spray comes highly recommended by NBC Select editorial operations associate &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/jem-alabi-ncpn1312495" target="_blank"&gt;Jem Alabi&lt;/a&gt;. She gets “a very serious case of dry mouth” from certain foods and drinks, and says this spray is her go-to solution. “It freshens my breath in a way that lasts for hours, and I love that it comes in a pack of four so I can keep one at work, home and in my travel backpack,” says Alabi. “The mint flavor is mild and doesn’t sting like some others can, but it also comes in a grape flavor if you want to switch it up.” The spray’s gentle formula, which contains xylitol, helps neutralize acids in your mouth to balance its pH as well, and it’s safe if you swallow it, according to the brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/dry-mouth-treatment-rcna241165?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=exchange&amp;amp;tblci=GiAM-FfQ5ZAs24MpB2Ckh-QyK3yDVHEH-yWi7OnNdFAQNCCU3j0ozI2ezbiJooBnMNL2Rw#anchor-3fba4c" id="anchor-3fba4c" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Best gum&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-ed4bd4"&gt;&lt;div id="rcpd63426" class="" data-testid="article-product-unit"&gt;&lt;div class="listicleProduct dn-print  product__grid-container--small" data-activity-map="listicle-product-article-body-orbit-sugar-free-gum" data-testid="product-container"&gt;&lt;div class="product__grid-row"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_accordion__Z2nEy styles_accordion__Coahi undefined styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion" data-title="What to know"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="styles_accordion__content__09JIS styles_accordion__content__9AV2h styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion__content" role="listbox" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsContainer__HAJ1f" data-testid="listicle-product__pros-cons-container" data-activity-map="product-article-body-orbit-sugar-free-gum"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;What we like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;ADA-accepted&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comes in 5 flavors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multipacks available&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;Something to note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nothing to note at this time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f850cf" class="body-graf"&gt;Chewing naturally causes saliva production, so you can use sugar-free gum as a saliva stimulant, says Lloyd. There’s options specifically made for dry mouth (like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ACT-Mouth-Moisturizing-Xylitol-Count/dp/B079119TPM?tag=drymouthtreatmentrcna241165-20" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-commerce-encoding="true" data-seller-id="ncrg916911"&gt;this one from Act&lt;/a&gt;), but any sugar-free option will do. “You don’t have to look for a really expensive way to manage dry mouth,” says Lloyd. “Whatever you can do to hyper-stimulate your salivary gland and tastebuds to produce saliva in healthy situations is beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dc715e" class="body-graf"&gt;Orbit’s ADA-accepted, sugar-free gum is my all-time favorite option.

Some toothpastes are specifically formulated for those with dry mouth, including this one from Bioténe. It won’t irritate your mouth or worsen symptoms, according to the brand, and it has a mild minty flavor to help freshen breath. The toothpaste’s fluoride fights cavities, remineralizes tooth enamel to strengthen it, making it more resistant to decay, and reduces bacteria in the mouth, plus it’s free from sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), a detergent that makes toothpaste foamy, yet some people are sensitive to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/dry-mouth-treatment-rcna241165?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=exchange&amp;amp;tblci=GiAM-FfQ5ZAs24MpB2Ckh-QyK3yDVHEH-yWi7OnNdFAQNCCU3j0ozI2ezbiJooBnMNL2Rw#anchor-bee018" id="anchor-bee018" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Best electric toothbrush&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-56f295"&gt;&lt;div id="rcpd63428" class="" data-testid="article-product-unit"&gt;&lt;div class="listicleProduct dn-print  product__grid-container--small" data-activity-map="listicle-product-article-body-oral-b-pro-1000-electric-toothbrush" data-testid="product-container"&gt;&lt;div class="product__grid-row"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_accordion__Z2nEy styles_accordion__Coahi undefined styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion" data-title="What to know"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="styles_accordion__content__09JIS styles_accordion__content__9AV2h styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion__content" role="listbox" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsContainer__HAJ1f" data-testid="listicle-product__pros-cons-container" data-activity-map="product-article-body-oral-b-pro-1000-electric-toothbrush"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;What we like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;ADA-accepted&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Built-in timer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small round brush head&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;Something to note&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;No change brush head indicator&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-54f6d5" class="body-graf"&gt;Consider getting an oscillating &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-electric-toothbrushes-ncna1193846" target="_blank"&gt;electric toothbrush&lt;/a&gt; if you have dry mouth, which cleans teeth more deeply than a manual toothbrush, says Lloyd. It removes built-up grime that the little saliva in your mouth couldn’t wash away, and dislodges gunk between teeth. “The oscillating bristle tips not only remove debris that they come in contact with, but their vibrating effects move beyond the bristles and can cause things to be removed from teeth two or three millimeters away from their ends,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-92b639" class="body-graf"&gt;Oral-B’s Pro 1000 Electric Toothbrush has all the features dentists recommend looking for in a quality toothbrush: the ADA Seal of Acceptance, a two-minute timer, a pressure sensor and a small round head to reach all of your mouth’s nooks and crannies. The brush head is also easily replaceable — dentists recommend swapping it out every three months and after you’re sick. Oral-B’s electric toothbrush lets you choose between three cleaning modes, and it comes with a charger stand. The battery lasts for about 10 days when fully charged, according to the brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="faq-embed" data-testid="article-faq-embed" id="anchor-ccc958"&gt;&lt;div class="faq-embed__content"&gt;&lt;h2 class="faq-embed__headline"&gt;&lt;span class="text"&gt;Frequently asked questions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="faq-embed__cards" data-testid="faq-embed__cards"&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__card" data-testid="faq-card__card"&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__content"&gt;&lt;button class="faq-card__question" type="button" data-testid="faq-card__question"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the most common causes of dry mouth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__answer" data-testid="faq-card__answer"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the causes below are lifelong, unavoidable conditions that lead to chronic dry mouth, says Lloyd. Other causes are temporary, and once addressed, people may be “cured” of dry mouth or experience it less severely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking certain medications&lt;/strong&gt;: Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that causes salivation, says Maddahi. Certain medications can impact that neurotransmitter by blocking it, which leads to decreased saliva production and, in turn, dry mouth. On other hand, some medications decrease fluid in the circulatory system, leading to dehydration and related saliva production. Examples of medications that usually cause dry mouth include those for anxiety, depression, pain, blood pressure, kidney dysfunction, urinary incontinence, allergies and weight loss. If you visit a company’s website, you can often read its medications’ labels and check which have “xerostomia” or “dry mouth” listed as a side effect. Messina says that those who take multiple medications are at higher risk for experiencing dry mouth compared to those who take only one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mouth breathing&lt;/strong&gt;: People often struggle to breathe through their nose if they have seasonal allergies and/or a deviated septum, says Maddahi. In these cases, people breathe through their mouth by keeping it open more than usual, which can dry it out, reduce saliva and cause gum inflammation around the top and bottom front teeth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cannabis, tobacco, vape and alcohol use&lt;/strong&gt;: All four can dry out the mouth, as well as cause dehydration. Smoking tobacco also often damages the salivary glands, which produce saliva, and irritates the mouth’s mucous membranes. Maddahi says any form of cannabis can lead to dry mouth, including gummies and other edibles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer treatments&lt;/strong&gt;: Chemotherapy usually leads to a temporary reduction in salivary gland function, so they produce less saliva during treatment, but regulate as damaged tissue heals, says Messina. If you’re treated for head and/or neck cancer with targeted radiation therapy, the salivary glands are usually permanently impacted and will no longer be able to function properly, says Lloyd.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diseases and other medical conditions&lt;/strong&gt;: Those with autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, Type 1 diabetes and Sjögren disease have a higher rate of dry mouth, says Lloyd. Dry mouth is also associated with other diseases, like Covid-19, cystic fibrosis and HIV/AIDS, as well as medical conditions like stroke and uncontrolled hypertension, says Messina. It’s related to hormonal changes, like during &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-pregnancy-safe-skin-care-rcna100065" target="_blank"&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/menopause-oral-health-rcna208207" target="_blank"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__card" data-testid="faq-card__card"&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__content"&gt;&lt;button class="faq-card__question" type="button" data-testid="faq-card__question"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the symptoms of dry mouth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__answer" data-testid="faq-card__answer"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s numerous symptoms of dry mouth, but asking his patients one question often lets Maddahi make a quick diagnosis: Do you sleep with water next to your bed? People who have dry mouth tend to wake up in the middle of the night to drink water because they’re desperate to get rid of the sticky, burning, tingling feeling associated with it. They also usually guzzle a glass of water first thing in the morning, and constantly carry around a water bottle to sip from throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rampant cavities and sudden tooth delay are other common symptoms of dry mouth that dentists worry about. If you don’t produce enough saliva, the number of cavity-causing bacteria in your mouth exponentially increases. And it doesn’t just cause one or two new cavities — Lloyd says he’s seen patients with up to 30 cavities that seemingly pop up out of nowhere, and with no prior history of oral health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other symptoms of dry mouth include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trouble swallowing and chewing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Labored speech&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Altered taste, causing food and drinks to be bland and flavorless&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intolerance for spicy, salty, or sour food and drinks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mouth injuries like cuts and sores, which often take a while to heal &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bad breath (halitosis)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dry, sore throat and hoarseness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dry, rough tongue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cracked, peeling, atrophic and/or sticky lips&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oral fungal infection (candidiasis)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frequent ulcers underneath dentures and artificial teeth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Problems keeping dentures and artificial teeth in place&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__card" data-testid="faq-card__card"&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__content"&gt;&lt;button class="faq-card__question" type="button" data-testid="faq-card__question"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What should you avoid if you have dry mouth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__answer" data-testid="faq-card__answer"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because those with dry mouth produce such little saliva, it’s important to avoid anything that can exacerbate the condition, make you more uncomfortable and increase your chance of tooth decay. To ensure that the small amount of saliva available can work as efficiently as possible, dentists recommend avoiding the below if you have dry mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol-based mouthwashes: &lt;/strong&gt;Most mouthwashes are made with alcohol, which acts as a disinfectant and kills bacteria that can lead to bad breath, gum disease and cavities. But it also has a drying effect, so those with dry mouth should stick to alcohol-free formulas, says Lloyd.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excessively drinking water&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s a natural instinct to drink water when your mouth feels dry, but in excess, water makes the condition worse. “Water doesn’t do anything to help your mouth, but saliva does,” says Maddahi. “By constantly drinking water, you’re diluting the very little saliva you have and reducing its effectiveness even further.” Instead, reach for a saliva stimulating product like a mouthrinse, spray or tablet, and save water strictly for hydration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food and drinks high in sugar&lt;/strong&gt;: Saliva neutralizes the acids produced by bacteria feeding on sugar in your mouth, and washes sugar off your teeth so it doesn’t sit on enamel. If you don’t produce enough saliva to perform either of these functions effectively, you’re at high risk for tooth decay, so cut back on sugary foods and drinks, including sucking candies and soda, dentists say.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeinated and alcoholic beverages, and spicy food&lt;/strong&gt;: They all have drying effects on the mouth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__card" data-testid="faq-card__card"&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__content"&gt;&lt;button class="faq-card__question" type="button" data-testid="faq-card__question"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How often should you go to the dentist if you have dry mouth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__answer" data-testid="faq-card__answer"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p data-element-id="131bfb"&gt;If you have dry mouth, you’re more likely to get cavities and have other oral health issues. To catch problems early if they arise, Maddahi says those with dry mouth should go to the dentist every three months rather than every six months, which is the standard recommendation from the ADA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__card" data-testid="faq-card__card"&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__content"&gt;&lt;button class="faq-card__question" type="button" data-testid="faq-card__question"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does aging cause dry mouth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;div class="faq-card__answer" data-testid="faq-card__answer"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p data-element-id="6604a9"&gt;Older adults are more likely to experience dry mouth, says Messina. In fact, it affects an estimated 30% of people older than 65 and up to 40% of people older than 80, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/resources/ada-library/oral-health-topics/xerostomia" target="_blank"&gt;ADA&lt;/a&gt;. Dry mouth isn’t a direct consequence of aging, however, since adults only produce moderately less saliva compared to younger adults, says Lloyd. The biggest contributing factor to dry mouth prevalence among this population is medication usage. Many older adults take medications, often multiple at a time, to control conditions like hypertension, urinary incontinence and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/dry-mouth-treatment-rcna241165?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=exchange&amp;amp;tblci=GiAM-FfQ5ZAs24MpB2Ckh-QyK3yDVHEH-yWi7OnNdFAQNCCU3j0ozI2ezbiJooBnMNL2Rw#anchor-ddd112" id="anchor-ddd112" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Meet our experts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c216b3" class="body-graf"&gt;At NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

Yet alongside their proven benefits, awareness is growing of a lesser-known, often silenced side effect: sexual dysfunction that may persist long after patients stop taking the medication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="7782n-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7782n-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7782n-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“I was on Cipralex for two and a half months,” wrote one man in an online support group. “While on it, I had almost no libido, trouble maintaining an erection, and less physical pleasure — even kisses felt dull. Months after stopping, some of that feeling returned, but not all of it. I later found out that for some people, the effects never go away. If I’d known this, I might have made a different decision — it’s wrong that psychiatrists don’t warn patients.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="2oktk-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide firstImageInArticle firstImageInArticleBody"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.HkxUATwGk11l" id="image_ArticleImageData.HkxUATwGk11l"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.HkxUATwGk11l" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/10/27/HJMJTAJTRgg/HJMJTAJTRgg_0_0_1000_527_0_x-large.jpg" alt="הפרעה בתפקוד המיני גבר" title="Sexual dysfunction that may persist long after patients stop taking the medication  (Photo: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.HkxUATwGk11l" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/10/27/HJMJTAJTRgg/HJMJTAJTRgg_0_0_1000_527_0_x-large.jpg" alt="הפרעה בתפקוד המיני גבר" title="Sexual dysfunction that may persist long after patients stop taking the medication  (Photo: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Sexual dysfunction that may persist long after patients stop taking the medication &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="13p2e-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="13p2e-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="13p2e-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;His post struck a nerve among thousands of patients — men and women — who take SSRIs. The lingering condition has a name: PSSD, or Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction. It describes sexual side effects that continue even after stopping the drug, including loss of libido, decreased pleasure, difficulty with arousal or orgasm, and numbness in the genitals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="ah9fh-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="ah9fh-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="ah9fh-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;A recent study in Epidemiology and Psychiatric Sciences found that in some patients, sexual function does not return to baseline even months or years after discontinuation — raising uncomfortable questions within psychiatry. Experts are divided: is this real, or the result of psychological factors?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="6b0dk-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6b0dk-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6b0dk-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;According to Dr. Oren Tene, head of the psychiatric department at Tel Aviv’s Ichilov Hospital and director of the Mentalix Center for Mental Health, sexual side effects during SSRI use are well documented.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="4o03o-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4o03o-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4o03o-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“It’s a known phenomenon,” he says. “It’s almost a cruel trade-off — when serotonin levels rise and mood improves, sexual function often declines. Nearly all SSRIs do this, some more than others. It’s a class-wide effect.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="714p7-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="714p7-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="714p7-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The symptoms, he explains, vary. “We commonly see reduced libido and delayed orgasm. Men may experience erectile issues, and women may experience decreased lubrication. Ironically, this particular side effect is sometimes used therapeutically — SSRIs are prescribed to men with premature ejaculation. But when the delay is excessive, it becomes frustrating for both partners.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="37t8t-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="37t8t-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="37t8t-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Dr. Tene adds that anxiety and depression themselves can suppress sexual function: “I tell patients that depression and good sex don’t go hand in hand. Sometimes the net effect of treatment is still positive.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="8ije5-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="8ije5-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="8ije5-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;While side effects during treatment are well established, what happens after stopping the medication remains contentious. “That’s where it gets controversial,” says Dr. Tene. “Does sexual dysfunction sometimes persist afterward? Literature increasingly suggests yes. It’s hard to study, but it seems to happen to a subset of patients, though we don’t know how many.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="fa8lo-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="28ahu-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="28ahu-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="28ahu-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Science has yet to pinpoint a cause. “Physiologically, there’s no clear explanation,” he says. “When the drug is in the system, we know serotonin interacts with dopamine and norepinephrine. But after discontinuation, theoretically, there’s no reason for ongoing symptoms. We just don’t know.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="d0vsu-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="d0vsu-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="d0vsu-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Underreporting is also likely, he adds. “Patients don’t always connect the dots. The most common complaints are reduced sensation, less pleasure, erectile issues, or delayed ejaculation. Many describe feeling ‘numb.’ Men seem to report it more, but women often describe more severe symptoms.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="fnjau-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="fnjau-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="fnjau-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Even within the medical community, there’s disagreement. “Some doctors argue patients misremember that their sexual function didn’t change much from before. The topic is difficult to study, and documenting every possible side effect is impossible.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="80ks8-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="80ks8-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="80ks8-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Dr. Tene stresses caution: “These are life-saving medications. Listing every rare or disputed side effect could scare patients away from treatment. On the other hand, patients deserve informed consent. It’s a delicate balance.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="evmd5-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="evmd5-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="evmd5-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;What can be done when symptoms persist? “Unfortunately, we don’t have a specific treatment,” says Dr. Tene. “For most, it resolves — sometimes after weeks or months, occasionally longer. But there’s no guaranteed fix.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="38fld-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="38fld-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="38fld-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Yifat Mekler, a sexologist and couples therapist at Rambam Health Care Campus, agrees that the condition is real but often temporary. “In most cases, symptoms fade within weeks to two months. Stopping antidepressants abruptly can prolong recovery — it shocks the nervous system and delays adjustment,” she explains.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="4c7gi-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="b4lo2-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="b4lo2-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="b4lo2-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Even when the body recovers, the mind can keep the problem alive. “The physical and psychological aspects are intertwined,” Mekler says. “Men often develop performance anxiety — they focus on what might go wrong instead of being present in the moment. That stress raises cortisol and adrenaline, which suppresses the parasympathetic response needed for arousal. It becomes a vicious cycle.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="4fd3r-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4fd3r-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4fd3r-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Therapeutic support, she adds, is crucial. “Sex therapy helps men shift focus away from performance and back to sensuality and connection. Couples can explore intimacy that isn’t centered on intercourse. If anxiety persists, psychiatric follow-up or temporary use of medications like Viagra can help.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="bo28o-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bo28o-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bo28o-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The discussion around PSSD has exposed a painful dilemma for many patients: the fear of losing sexual vitality versus the desperation to escape depression and anxiety. The result is growing mistrust toward psychiatry — and confusion about what patients are told, and what remains unsaid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="7364d-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7364d-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7364d-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;But psychiatrists warn that public fear can have deadly consequences. “We encourage people who need these drugs to take them,” says Dr. Tene. “SSRIs can truly save lives and alter the course of illness.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="dm69q-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="dm69q-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="dm69q-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;He cautions against alarmism. “When public discourse demonizes these medications, it drives people away from help. The vast majority of SSRI users experience mild or temporary side effects, and overall, the benefit far outweighs the risk.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8tkqo" data-offset-key="8fta0-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="8fta0-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="8fta0-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;His message is one of balance. “Every medication has side effects. The key is weighing benefits against risks. SSRIs are among the safest and most effective treatments we have for depression and anxiety. They’ve improved — and saved — millions of lives. Awareness is important, but so is perspective.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 17:37:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFByZ0hHS3liOUpDN21nSjFYdkpnQWtqYmhrZW1sNjE1MThZMEFNTnl4cFp1ek1KeXVqamJFN2w5REN2NU9KNzVwZXNvSzQ1V3FaX3BtRkl4QTRKeUFKX1hEN3lJYjVLWnBZNEE</guid></item><item><title>强大的新抗生素，可以杀死在土壤细菌中发现的超级细菌-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03595-3</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03595-3/d41586-025-03595-3_51645706.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03595-3/d41586-025-03595-3_51645706.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Close up of a colony of Streptomyces coelicolor bacteria growing on an agar medium (brown) in a petri dish." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03595-3/d41586-025-03595-3_51645706.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;A colony of &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces coelicolor &lt;/i&gt;bacteria secretes an antibiotic compound (red) into the surrounding medium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Dr Jeremy Burgess/Science Photo Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By studying the process through which a soil bacterium naturally produces a well-known drug, scientists have discovered a powerful antibiotic that could help to fight drug-resistant infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments described in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/i&gt; on Monday&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, the team studied the multi-step pathway that the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces coelicolor&lt;/i&gt; uses to make the antibiotic methylenomycin A, which was first identified in 1965&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. They discovered an intermediate compound — called premethylenomycin C lactone — whose antimicrobial activity was 100 times stronger than that of the final product. Tiny doses of it killed strains of bacteria known to cause hard-to-treat infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02601-4" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03595-3/d41586-025-03595-3_27689634.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Five ways science is tackling the antibiotic resistance crisis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery was a ‘surprise’, says study co-author Gregory Challis, a chemical biologist at the University of Warwick in Coventry, UK. “As humans, we anticipate that evolution perfects the end product, and so you’d expect the final molecule to be the best antibiotic, and the intermediates to be less potent,” he says. But the finding “is a great example of what a ‘blind watchmaker’ evolution is. And it’s a good way of exemplifying it in a very molecular way,” adds Challis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03218-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03218-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt; is a growing threat, projected to cause 39 million deaths worldwide over the next 25 years. Researchers say that the discovery of a potent antimicrobial compound might lead to fresh drugs to tackle resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work underscores “the potential of such studies to identify new bioactive chemical scaffolds from ‘old’ pathways”, says Gerard Wright, a biochemist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Accidental discovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Challis and his colleagues began studying the molecular pathway through which &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces coelicolor&lt;/i&gt; produces methylenomycin A. To do this, they deleted the genes encoding enzymes involved in each step, one by one. Their work built on earlier efforts in 2002 to sequence the bacterium’s genome&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00945-z" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03595-3/d41586-025-03595-3_50915536.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;New antibiotic that kills drug-resistant bacteria discovered in technician’s garden&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2010, the team had mapped the mechanism that the bacterium used to make methylenomycin A and identified several intermediate molecules that it produced along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were just doing very fundamental blue-sky research,” says Challis. “We discovered these intermediates, and we left them for a while because we didn’t quite know what to do with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was several years later — around 2017 — that a PhD student at Challis’s laboratory tested these intermediate molecules for antimicrobial activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tests revealed that two molecules, including premethylenomycin C lactone, were much more effective than methylenomycin A at targeting seven strains of Gram-positive bacteria, including &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, which infects skin, blood and internal organs, and &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecium&lt;/i&gt;, which can cause deadly bloodstream and urinary infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lowest concentration of premethylenomycin C lactone needed to kill drug-resistant strains of &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; was just 1 microgram per millilitre, compared with 256 micrograms per millilitre of methylenomycin A. The compound could also kill bacteria at much smaller doses than those needed for vancomycin, a ‘last line’ antibiotic used to treat infections caused by two &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecium&lt;/i&gt; strains, to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
