That’s not breaking news. Sugars and artificial flavors &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/01/what-is-the-healthiest-coke/85375529007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;lack quality nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. So, many people reach for &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/01/what-is-the-healthiest-coke/85375529007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;diet soda&lt;/a&gt;. But that’s not so healthy either. Recent research found that even &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/10/08/soda-diet-liver-disease-study-research/86579096007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;just one can of diet soda&lt;/a&gt; can contribute to &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/12/12/can-you-get-diabetes-from-eating-too-much-sugar/71764449007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;liver&lt;/a&gt; disease. Regular soda, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Yet, many Americans are addicted to fizzy drinks. And for those who wish to stop, cutting soda cold-turkey might not be a good idea — as some USA TODAY journalists &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/10/29/soda-health-side-effects-quitting-caffeine/86585472007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;recently learned&lt;/a&gt; when we tried it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“People are struggling to stop even though they really want to,” explains Ashley Gearhardt, professor of psychology at the University of Michigan. “You go through withdrawal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That’s because soda &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/11/12/soda-addiction-science-sugar-caffeine/86963258007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;appeals to our brain’s instinctual desire&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/12/20/is-corn-syrup-bad-for-you/71848699007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;sugars&lt;/a&gt; and fats that help us survive — and our bodies adapt to increasingly high exposure to these ingredients over time, raising tolerance and making quitting painful, Gearhardt explains. You may get headaches, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/05/31/why-am-i-so-angry-all-the-time/83835896007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;irritability&lt;/a&gt; and anxiety, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“You have to think about it as if you were quitting smoking,” Gearhardt says. “You need to know what are your cues? What are your triggers? What emotions set you off? Certain times of day? Certain people? … Then you can come up with plans for a replacement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The alternative that’s right for you has a lot to do with why you’re drinking soda in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Here's how to get started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;The best soda alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“If people want caffeine, switching to coffee without sweetener is much healthier,” Gearhardt says, but she gives one warning: “Getting caffeine through soda gives energy much faster. You may not get as intense of a caffeine hit from coffee, so there might be a little bit of grieving … but that’s because we weren’t supposed to be getting that in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Morning headache? You can also try over-the-counter medications that contain a bit of &lt;a href="/story/life/2022/12/02/how-much-caffeine-is-dangerous/10723118002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, says Jennifer Temple, director of the Nutrition and Health Research Laboratory at the University of Buffalo. If you’re using soda to address a chronic medical issue, such as &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/21/why-does-my-head-hurt/85661258007/?utm_source=taboola&amp;amp;utm_medium=deeperdive&amp;amp;utm_campaign=oc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;migraines&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a good idea to consult your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/05/28/is-green-tea-good-for-you-health-benefits-every-day/70244800007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Tea is a good option&lt;/a&gt; for a later-in-the-day &lt;a href="/story/life/2022/12/02/how-much-caffeine-is-dangerous/10723118002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;caffeine boost&lt;/a&gt; as it generally contains less caffeine than coffee. And if you can’t stand the taste of coffee or tea, remember there are many varieties and flavors to try – and either of these beverages with a bit of natural sweetener or &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/04/01/is-milk-good-for-you/82639148007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; is going to be better for you than soda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If you love &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/09/25/is-seltzer-water-bad-for-you/70823544007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;carbonation&lt;/a&gt;, Gearhardt says to try seltzer or non-sweetened &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/09/26/is-seltzer-water-bad-for-you/86335041007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;sparkling water&lt;/a&gt; "in the periods you would be going for a soda.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If you love soda for the taste, Temple suggests making “spa water” flavored with lemon, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/06/08/are-cucumbers-good-for-you/83973776007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;cucumber&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/07/17/what-is-ginger-beneficial-for/84468526007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;ginger&lt;/a&gt;, mint, basil or other &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/22/are-mandarin-oranges-good-for-you/85670307007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;fresh ingredients&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Electrolyte powders, &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/07/25/is-apple-juice-good-for-you/85253328007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;juice&lt;/a&gt; and kombucha also substitute sweetness and &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/04/12/can-dehydration-cause-high-blood-pressure/11634018002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;quench thirst&lt;/a&gt;, but be careful of sneaky high sodium amounts or other &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/11/13/is-erythritol-safe/71485440007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;additives&lt;/a&gt;, Gearhardt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;When soda is your best bet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Soda is OK to use as an alcohol replacement because most people usually only drink alcohol at certain times or in certain settings anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“If it’s an occasional thing, there is flexibility,” Gearhardt says. Like we do with alcohol, set up “no soda zones,” such as your work area to reduce the number of hours and places you could potentially drink a soda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If you want to swap out soda at your next happy hour, check out &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/06/11/what-is-a-mocktail/84044261007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;mocktails&lt;/a&gt;, zero-proof &lt;a href="/story/money/2025/09/25/beer-companies-health-concerns-alcohol/86299088007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;beer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/story/news/health/2025/01/03/can-alcohol-cause-cancer-surgeon-general/77430536007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;wine&lt;/a&gt; or alcohol-free liquors, Temple says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;If you can't quit soda...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When in doubt, Gearhardt says use your common sense: What is the lowest-sugar option you have at any place and time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And when stopping soda has you feeling down, Gearhardt says to remember this is about prioritizing wellbeing. It’s not “quitting,” she says, it’s “getting healthier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If you’re not ready to ditch soda altogether, that’s OK. Eliminating just one soda per day can make a major health impact, Temple says: “View it more like a treat than a daily habit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s50"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s75"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>USA Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQeEZ4cXZkUWVrU0czaXJEb252ZDFBM004UmdKVW1xYzl1bnp3dm5HTzZSd1BCVkIwelpPM3ZTQnM5NDNMSk82bzdZbi1nRF84UUhjZHFkcmtjbXViTVNsTzlSZ1A1Z3pBVmZUU1R0d0xSbXJNNldPU3RGQ0g1ekladl9LY2tSR2pneVR5NE5lNXdPOVc3Yks2ZDZFNkQ1dXBFazBibXdxSmg</guid></item><item><title>我们有史以来最奇怪的冬季病毒季节指南- vox.com</title><link>https://www.vox.com/health/470968/cold-and-flu-season-shots-vaccines-rfk-jr</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="zephr-anchor" class="_1agbrix10"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This winter was already shaping up to be one of the &lt;em&gt;strangest&lt;/em&gt; cold and flu seasons in recent memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;With Robert F. Kennedy at the helm of the US Department of Health and Human Services, the federal government has been &lt;a href="/podcasts/462402/rfk-jr-childhood-vaccine-schedule-advisory-committee-immunization-practices"&gt;casting doubt&lt;/a&gt; on the value of vaccines in the months leading up to virus season. Even though his department did approve a new flu vaccine for this year, his advisers also &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/rfk-jr-s-vaccine-committee-to-vote-on-flu-shots-and-preservative-thimerosal"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; removing certain ingredients from flu shots, even though those materials are not used in the vast majority of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst6"&gt;&lt;ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1agbrixi _739u100 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The federal government is not going to be a reliable ally during this year’s cold and flu season, having already taken steps to undermine trust in both the Covid and flu vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;You can protect yourself this winter — but you’ll have to do it yourself, in cooperation with the people close to you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Think about your own risk and how much risk you’re willing to tolerate, communicate clearly with friends and family about your approach, and keep a close eye on your local situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;They have also &lt;a href="/health/460528/vaccine-recommendations-rfk-hhs-new-guidance-covid"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; any specific recommendations for the Covid vaccinations and, instead, told people to depend on “individual decision making.” On the cusp of flu activity picking up in the US, a top Food and Drug Administration official is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/29/fda-vaccine-approval-child-covid-deaths/"&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; that the vaccine process should be overhauled because it is not sufficient, while making unsubstantiated claims that the Covid shots have killed a small number of children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And now, the forecast for the next few months is getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Not only is there disarray among public health authorities, but this year’s cold and flu season is looking to be especially bad. That is partly bad luck; developing a new flu shot every year is always a guessing game, and this year’s shot is &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-vaccines/absent-cdc-and-mismatched-subclade-k-flu-strain-experts-face-upcoming-season"&gt;not very well matched&lt;/a&gt; to the most widespread flu strains. But, it’s also partly a matter of choice, a consequence of the anti-public health mania Kennedy has helped stoke. The number of flu vaccinations administered between August and October &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/18/health/new-flu-variant-subclade-k?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-90CEPo7LTAmN5x15eEfmmRynhCyV3GbnUtBeq6U-L1vRIAoTXov57Ts4wY6WY3-o8GR_b8kMfz2v5_S2NxAyVjKgsTDQ&amp;amp;_hsmi=390652300&amp;amp;utm_content=390652300&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;was the lowest&lt;/a&gt; in the past six years. The number of Covid boosters available to the public has been steadily dropping with each new shot, and now, Kennedy Jr.’s health department has decided to limit access. Less than 15 percent of US adults &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/vaccination-trends.html#:~:text=21%2C%202025-,About,with%20a%20health%20care%20provider."&gt;have received&lt;/a&gt; a Covid booster this year, including less than 1 in 3 seniors over 65. New RSV vaccines for infants &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/respiratory-syncytial-virus-rsv/study-finds-low-varied-rsv-monoclonal-and-maternal-vaccination#:~:text=State%20variations%2C%20timing%20tracking,improvements%20as%20the%20season%20progressed."&gt;have had discouragingly low uptake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This winter, more than ever, we are all on our own in combating flu, cold, RSV, and Covid-19. The federal government is no longer a reliable ally, because it has shown, with Kennedy leading the charge, that it will &lt;a href="/health/459768/trump-cdc-director-monarez-robert-kennedy-jr"&gt;routinely ignore established science&lt;/a&gt;. The medical community is scrambling to fill the void, but the fundamental challenge is that many people, not only within Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again movement but across the political spectrum, no longer trust the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In this new reality, not everyone will be on the same page. Some people may choose to take no precautions at all, even as cases rise. But, you do have agency to protect your personal well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="public-health-is-out-for-now-were-in-a-new-era-of-diy-health" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;“Public” health is out for now. We’re in a new era of DIY health.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For a long time, public health was embraced by the public. It had stacked up wins over the decades: eradicating polio and smallpox in the 20th century and measles at the turn of the 21st. Diseases that had killed millions over millennia were relegated to the past as better sanitation, vaccinations, and greater awareness — the bedrock of the public health playbook — became woven into everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As recently as a decade ago, the people who opposed vaccinations and other public health interventions remained well outside of the mainstream. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. himself was, before the start of the Covid pandemic, a marginal figure who spewed conspiracy theories about vaccines and autism. Even Trump kept his distance from Kennedy during his first term, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-trump-rfk-jr-vaccine-panel-book-2025-10"&gt;reportedly at the urging of Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt;, despite his own past flirtations with anti-vaccine rhetoric. And while Kennedy’s influence and the work of other anti-vaccine activists may have chipped away at the public’s belief in vaccinations, they had limited success. Most Americans still thought getting their annual shots was a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But, we live in a different reality now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Two decades ago, 94 percent of Americans believed it was extremely or very important to get children vaccinated — near unanimity, according to &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx"&gt;Gallup&lt;/a&gt;. In 2025, just 69 percent still agree.

By &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-tylenol-autism-link-and-vaccine-policies/"&gt;October 2025&lt;/a&gt;, that share had fallen to 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When the worst measles outbreak in years &lt;a href="/vaccines/411756/us-measles-outbreak-cases-deaths-charts"&gt;took hold&lt;/a&gt; in West Texas earlier this year, local health officials were &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-government-pulls-back-over-11-billion-funding-state-health-departments-2025-03-26/"&gt;losing their federal funding&lt;/a&gt; and getting limited support at best from the CDC while Kennedy waffled on the value of vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/05/health/measles-rfk-vitamin-a-misinformation"&gt;embraced&lt;/a&gt; unproven treatments such as cod liver oil. As Milwaukee contended with a lead poisoning crisis in its school buildings, its residents had no one in Washington to call, because the relevant team &lt;a href="/public-health/413352/donald-trump-rfk-milwaukee-schools-lead-poisoning"&gt;had been fired&lt;/a&gt;. Whooping cough is back and worse than it’s been in years as vaccination rates fall. Kennedy has been mum on the issue, despite &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5501601-cassidy-kennedy-whooping-cough-louisiana/"&gt;pleas&lt;/a&gt; from Republican senators to weigh in publicly and affirm the value of the whooping cough vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We’re a deeply divided country, specifically on the subject of &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; health. And that means a lot of your neighbors aren’t going to take precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="heres-how-you-can-navigate-this-sickness-season-in-these-unusual-times" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Here’s how you can navigate this sickness season in these unusual times&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you are concerned about your &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt; health, what do you do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Let’s start by talking about risk. Much of the backlash to the various pandemic interventions — things like masking and issuing vaccine mandates — was founded in different people’s differing risk assessments and risk tolerance. You would hear it all the time from the opponents of those measures: Why should a young man with no serious health problems be &lt;em&gt;required &lt;/em&gt;to get a shot? Many people today find the traditional public health argument — because he might unwittingly pass it along to another person who is more vulnerable — unpersuasive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And, to be fair, it is true that certain people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have a much higher risk of Covid, or flu, or RSV than others do — and their choices and behaviors during what most of us call the cold and flu season can reasonably differ. No two people are exactly alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That is simply the reality we are living in: individual health, not public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So, your seasonal strategy should start with assessing your own risk. If you are 25 years old with no children and minimal exposure to the elderly, you may decide it’s reasonable to take chances on, for example, going out in public when flu activity is high in your area. If you’re a 65-year-old with a chronic health condition or a compromised immune system, you might not be willing to take the same risks; at least, you might want to think about wearing a mask if there are a lot of Covid or RSV cases in your community. If you are, like me, the 38-year-old parent of three, you might fall somewhere in between the two poles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Think about your own situation and the people you come into contact with every day and use that as a guide by which you can evaluate your risk and make decisions. Get on the same page with the people in your life you see regularly: your family, friends and coworkers. You don’t have to completely agree on your risk tolerance to be open and transparent about your mindset as we head into the season. If there are certain dealbreakers — like, &lt;em&gt;I don’t want you to come to my house if you have a runny nose or fever&lt;/em&gt; — talk about how you’ll handle those situations in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;From that baseline, you need reliable information as the winter goes on and viral activity starts to pick up. Start local. Most people &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/public-opinion/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-tylenol-autism-link-and-vaccine-policies/"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; they have much more trust in their personal doctor than they do in major medical organizations, including the CDC. If you have a primary care doctor, or you can find one, they will be a reliable source whom you can speak to face to face or over a telehealth call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you don’t have a primary physician, or you simply want to educate yourself on what leading medical authorities are saying, you can check out the recommended vaccinations for children under 18 from &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/AAP-Immunization-Schedule.pdf"&gt;the American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;. Different state groups — one on &lt;a href="https://sharedsystems.dhsoha.state.or.us/DHSForms/Served/le-1157350.pdf"&gt;the West Coast&lt;/a&gt;, one in &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2025/09/nephc-covid-19-vaccine-consensus-recommendation-final-to-leadership-9_15_2025.pdf"&gt;New England&lt;/a&gt; — are issuing their own vaccine recommendations for adults. The West Coast Health Alliance, for example, advises all adults over 65 to get a Covid shot, people under 65 with certain risk factors, and all adults who are in contact with high-risk patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Your insurance coverage could be different this year, too, after the changes to vaccine guidance made by the Trump administration. Kennedy’s health department has scaled back the official government vaccine guidance to “individual decision making” — once again, you’re on your own — and that could affect some insurers’ willingness to cover the cost of a Covid shot. You could call your health plan in advance to find out if it will be covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And otherwise, keep an eye on what’s happening in your community. State governments often publish infectious disease dashboards with up-to-date data, and local health departments usually send out advisories when local case loads are high. I live in Ohio, and &lt;a href="https://data.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/data/view/summary-of-infectious-diseases-in-ohio"&gt;here’s what my local source looks like&lt;/a&gt;. Resources like this will help you understand the specifics of how illnesses are moving through your own community so that you can then weigh your risk and — if you choose — adjust your behavior accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;You can still build a disease-resilient community this winter. But it’s up to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 12:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOeV85RzFneHNqWFJBczNMV3lhbEtOVUxQZGxOR1FQMUN6M0liRmZHekk4Yi1aMWdkNWJLUkpNM1V5aVExOGJ6VDRnT2xsLVlOaVZMaFpFNkJKaXNWT2tHNzlRbHBqUVNJQXFiWnMyazlYQThqZF9MdnY2TzBScGdqaA</guid></item><item><title>新的研究揭示了“成年”大脑阶段实际何时开始—而且比你想象的要晚得多- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/brain-changes-by-age-adolescence-32_l_692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When does adulthood actually start? Probably later than you think. According to &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-025-65974-8" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a recent study published in the journal Nature Communications" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-025-65974-8" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;a recent study published in the journal Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, when it comes to brain functionality, adulthood starts at 32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. The findings show that the human brain has five phases throughout a lifespan, and researchers say they are all broken up by age — 9, 32, 66 and 83, on average. Researchers referred to these ages as “turning points” when the brain rewires and goes through age-related changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The childhood brain, a time of high growth, lasts through roughly age 9, when it then changes to the adolescent brain, which continues until 32. Yes, 32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that someone who is in the later part of this adolescent brain phase is going to act like a teenager, Dr. Alexa Mousley, the study leader, told &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/nov/25/brain-human-cognitive-development-life-stages-cambridge-study" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The Guardian" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/nov/25/brain-human-cognitive-development-life-stages-cambridge-study" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it means their brains simply resemble each other as they continue to grow and form until the adult brain phase is reached. This adolescent brain phase is the only time when brain efficiency is consistently increasing, &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/five-ages-human-brain" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="study authors said" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/five-ages-human-brain" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;study authors said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age 32 also marks the “strongest shift” of all of the brain changes. Around this time, the brain goes into its adult era ― the longest phase ― which lasts until roughly age 66. During the adult era, or adult “epoch” as researchers call these phases, there is a “plateau in intelligence and personality,” the study &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/five-ages-human-brain" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="press release states" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/five-ages-human-brain" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;press release states&lt;/a&gt;. Meaning, brain function stays pretty much the same for these decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 66, the brain changes, and it moves into the “early aging” phase, which does not have dramatic changes, but the brain does show “further reduced connectivity as white matter starts to degenerate,” Mousley said in a press release. This aligns with the physical health issues that often start to appear in the 60s, Mousley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an age when people face increased risk for a variety of health conditions that can affect the brain, such as hypertension,” Mousley said in the statement. Hypertension (also known as high blood pressure) can put you at higher risk of stroke and &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/high-blood-pressure-linked-cognitive-decline" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="cognitive decline." data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/high-blood-pressure-linked-cognitive-decline" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;cognitive decline.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final epoch starts at 83 and is known as “late aging,” which is a time when brain connectivity reduces and there is more reliance on specific regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To gather this data, researchers looked at a number of factors, including brain compartmentalization, along with the changes and deterioration of the nerve fibers in the brains of 3,802 people ages 0 to 90 via data from MRI scans. All participants were described as “neurotypical.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study does have limitations. The late-aging group of people was smaller than the other groups. More, participants in all groups had to meet certain health criteria, which may make them healthier than the general public. This could mean that study participants’ brain functionality may be more optimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jose Luis Pelaez via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jose Luis Pelaez via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The brain does not reach adulthood until about age 32, according to a new study.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain changes are inevitable as you age, but there are things you can do to keep your brain healthy. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain health is a major concern for people as they grow older, especially with more than &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-future-burden-dementia-united-states" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="6 million Americans" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/risk-future-burden-dementia-united-states" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;6 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; having a dementia diagnosis. &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/forgetfulness-7-types-of-normal-memory-problems" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Forgetting things here and there" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/forgetfulness-7-types-of-normal-memory-problems" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Forgetting things here and there&lt;/a&gt; is no major cause for concern as you get older, but if those memory issues disrupt your life, you should talk to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are things you can do to help keep your brain as optimal as possible throughout your lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy habits, overall, &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.gov/life-with-dementia/can-i-prevent-dementia" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="can help reduce dementia risk factors" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="692da335e4b0c8c3c7ce6833" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.alzheimers.gov/life-with-dementia/can-i-prevent-dementia" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;can help reduce dementia risk factors&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/a-new-type-of-opioid-is-killing-people-in-the-us-europe-and-australia/"&gt;synthetic opioid&lt;/a&gt; is tasteless, odorless, and invisible when mixed with other substances, and drug users are often unaware of its presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;It’s why biotech entrepreneur Collin Gage is aiming to protect people against the drug’s lethal effects. In 2023, he became the cofounder and CEO of ARMR Sciences to develop a vaccine against fentanyl. Now, the company is launching a trial to test its vaccine in people for the first time. The goal: prevent deaths from overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“It became very apparent to me that as I assessed the treatment landscape, everything that exists is reactionary,” Gage says. “I thought, why are we not preventing this?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Fifty times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine, fentanyl was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as an intravenous pain reliever and anesthetic. Its potential for abuse was &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526590014009055"&gt;recognized even then&lt;/a&gt;, and clinicians could get it only in combination with the sedative droperidol in a ratio of 50:1 droperidol to fentanyl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Cheap to make and incredibly addictive, fentanyl is now found in street drugs and counterfeit pills, because it boosts their potency and cuts costs. The drug is the biggest driver of overdose deaths in the United States and the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Naloxone, known by the brand name Narcan, can rapidly reverse overdoses caused by fentanyl and other opioids. Widespread distribution of the medication contributed to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-reports-decline-in-us-drug-overdose-deaths.html"&gt;24 percent decline&lt;/a&gt; in US drug overdose deaths in 2024. It works by attaching to opioid receptors throughout the body and displacing the opioid molecules that are attached there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;But a vaccine like the one ARMR Sciences is developing would be given before a person even encounters the drug. Gage likens it to a bulletproof vest or a suit of armor—hence the company’s name. (It was previously registered as Ovax but switched names in January.) “This is something that could completely change the paradigm of how we deal with overdose, because it doesn’t require someone to be carrying the treatment on them,” Gage says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Opioid vaccines were initially proposed in the 1970s, but after early attempts at heroin vaccines failed, much of the research was abandoned. The modern opioid epidemic has led to a resurgence of interest, with &lt;a href="https://heal.nih.gov/about/research-plan"&gt;backing from the US government&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxNZGVjME9BRk9LclB1ZjMwcUtWcDJiZkNSd212Z2dUUE9obDFsNmUtVWMxU1JuMkdVZk1TM0tMMWJkdHQ1Vm92NXlVY1dROFBZQUh3dmtUUy02c2RlZl90eWNlT3Q1UjhFd2xsR3BPZVFmUkR0OFZIRDdDQ0p2dHpFX0pUdHQ1dXNNNTN1eg</guid></item><item><title>服用Ozempic的人正在失去肌肉质量—这让他们感到震惊- vox.com</title><link>https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/469742/ozempic-wegovy-zepbound-mounjaro-weight-loss-side-effects-muscle</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="zephr-anchor" class="_1agbrix10"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac56 lg8ac55 xkp0cg1"&gt;We’re used to seeing Serena Williams on our TVs, muscles flexing, smashing a tennis ball past her opponent. But in a recent&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBaDgCN3hRU"&gt; 30-second&lt;/a&gt; commercial, Williams traded the racket for a GLP-1 drug injector pen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Williams, whose most recent child was born in 2023, has become a spokeswoman in her post-retirement days for Ro, one of the many boutique health care firms to get in on the GLP-1 craze. “They say GLP-1s for weight loss is a shortcut — it’s not. It’s science,” she says during the spot. “After kids, it’s the medicine my body needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Patients should be eating a protein-rich, balanced diet and doing some kind of strength training when on an GLP-1 medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Some patients taking GLP-1 drugs have experienced significant muscle loss and weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;• Experts worry that too many patients may be trying to use GLP-1 drugs as a shortcut instead of improving their diet and exercise to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here is one of the world’s greatest athletes, giving voice — in commercials running during primetime TV, on &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@todayshow/video/7541017696591252749"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Today&lt;/em&gt; show&lt;/a&gt;, and on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNnxUpiuZVs/?hl=en"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; — to a frustration that many people have felt. She gained weight after she had kids. And even though, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MAYscxxhDE"&gt;in her words&lt;/a&gt;, she was “doing everything right” after the pregnancy, she couldn’t cut as much weight as she liked. That’s where the GLP-1 drug came in and delivered results: Williams lost 31 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But there’s just one problem with the pitch: GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;, in some ways, a shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Americans always want the fucking pill,” Dr. Robert Lustig, a metabolic scientist at the University of California-San Francisco, told me. “I view GLP-1s like a Band-Aid. … There’s nothing wrong with a Band-Aid. But what if you didn’t clean your wound and you just put the Band-Aid on? The Band-Aid is necessary, but it’s not sufficient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The consequences of patients slapping on the Band-Aid — taking a GLP-1 — without treating the underlying issue with the kind of healthy eating and exercise that are still necessary even with these drugs is becoming clear. Scientists have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937282/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that some GLP-1 patients can lose significant muscle mass, as well as a loss of functional strength, due to a lack of energy. Rather than feel fitter and ready to go out in the world or onto the tennis court, these are patients &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1msh9a5/anyone_experiencing_muscle_weakness_since_starting/"&gt;who find walking up the stairs to be almost debilitating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For this story, I sought to understand how this is playing out in American culture. In searching Reddit communities dedicated to GLP-1 drugs, I found lots of normal people whose experience backed up that research: They had long tried to lose weight but could never quite meet their goals — until they went on a GLP-1 drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But even as they lost weight, they didn’t feel better. Some of them felt worse, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1id8100/muscle_loss_weakness/"&gt;weaker&lt;/a&gt;. There are &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1msh9a5/anyone_experiencing_muscle_weakness_since_starting/"&gt;dozens&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1f56pry/losing_muscle_tone_everywhere_including_pelvic/"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; of GLP-1 patients &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1i3317w/losing_muscle_mass_like_crazy/"&gt;coming to their peers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1id8100/muscle_loss_weakness/"&gt;asking for advice about workouts&lt;/a&gt; they could do &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1f2o8pu/muscle_recovery/"&gt;to stem the muscle loss&lt;/a&gt;. A few &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1kop4w5/muscle/"&gt;hope to find the right diet&lt;/a&gt; that will allow them to feel energetic and avoid muscle loss while losing the weight — but without having to commit to strength training that needs to go along with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While the term “strength training” may conjure images of ripped bodybuilders, doctors increasingly emphasize the importance of muscle training for all of their patients, from the 30-year-old marathon runner to the 65-year-old retiree. That’s because research has shown that more &lt;a href="https://cospineandjoint.com/muscle-mass-fall-risk-research/"&gt;lean muscle helps you age better and protects against hazards, such as falls, that pose a greater and greater threat as you get older&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These drugs are already &lt;a href="/future-perfect/467025/ozempic-glp-1-drugs-obesity-weight-loss"&gt;wildly popular&lt;/a&gt;, and their use is likely to keep growing. In November, the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/06/health/obesity-drug-prices-trump.html"&gt;struck deals&lt;/a&gt; with Lilly and Novo Nordisk to lower the cash price of their drugs in exchange for expanded Medicare coverage. Those price changes, which will begin to take effect next year, could further grow the number of Americans taking these medications, including among seniors for whom &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/a-guide-to-combatting-sarcopenia-and-preserving-muscle-mass-as-you-get-older"&gt;any loss of muscle mass is a serious health concern&lt;/a&gt;. One quarter of &lt;a href="https://www.ispor.org/docs/default-source/cti-meeting-21021-documents/2258f380-ec14-4bf3-bc24-d6b1f4a0a272.pdf?sfvrsn=585565ec_0"&gt;GLP-1 prescriptions dispensed in 2024&lt;/a&gt; were for people older than 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Falls are already &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/new-old-age-paula-span-falls-mortality-death-older-people-prescription-drugs/"&gt;one of the most potent killers of older adults&lt;/a&gt;; more than 40,000 Americans over 65 died from falls in 2023, and the death rate has tripled since 1990. If more patients start taking semaglutide for its effects on cognition, for example, and fail to eat and exercise properly, they could experience malnourishment and significant muscle loss; both could put their long-term health at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That doesn’t mean GLP-1 drugs are a bad deal for public health. On the population level, obesity is &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/adult-overweight-obesity/health-risks"&gt;associated with a host of major ills&lt;/a&gt;, and Americans have long been desperate to lose weight. The class of drugs that includes Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and now countless others — Zepbound, compound GLP-1s, etc. — are the most impressive weight-loss tools we’ve ever seen. They work because they slow digestion and tell your brain you’re full, which makes it easier for people to eat less. While these treatments are still fairly new, observational studies have &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/health-rounds-patients-drop-fewer-pounds-with-weight-loss-drugs-real-world-than-2025-06-11/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that patients who stay on these drugs for a year or more can lose 10 percent of their body weight on average. And on the population level, obesity rates are &lt;a href="/future-perfect/467025/ozempic-glp-1-drugs-obesity-weight-loss"&gt;already starting to decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Scientists are also discovering that these drugs have amazing potential to treat a breadth of issues: from addressing &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/16/glp1-weight-loss-addiction-drug-alcohol/"&gt;substance-abuse disorders&lt;/a&gt;, lowering &lt;a href="https://www.biospace.com/drug-development/evidence-mounts-for-benefit-of-glp-1s-against-heart-disease"&gt;your risk for heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, and even potentially preventing &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2025/popular-diabetes-medications-may-protect-against-alzheimers-disease-uf-researchers-find#:~:text=The%20data%20showed%20a%20statistically,cognitive%20decline%20in%20Alzheimer%E2%80%99s%20patients."&gt;dementia and Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. Recent studies have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251112011810.htm"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that taking a GLP-1 like Wegovy or Ozempic is even associated with lower cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But to stem the risk of muscle-mass loss, you must also be willing to commit to improving your diet and adopting a serious workout regimen over the long term. GLP-1 drugs may be magical when it comes to weight loss, but they are not magic pills. Which means that along with the rise of Ozempic and other GLP-1s is a coming reckoning over America’s shortcut culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="is-this-just-a-necessary-evil-to-weight-loss" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;“Is this just a necessary evil to weight loss?”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Plenty of athletes who are not world-famous see the same appeal in GLP-1 drugs that Serena Williams did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One person in particular stood out to me. A self-identified weight lifter, CrossFit enthusiast, and horse rider, who I’ll call Sam, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1ju53r2/muscle_loss/"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; their experience on Reddit. They explained they had always struggled to lose weight despite strict meal preparation and eating a lot of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And so, Sam started taking Wegovy. ”I’m happy with the results,” they said — before getting to a pretty big caveat for somebody who’s always had an active life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Despite aiming to eat 100 grams of protein every day, they said they were feeling weak. “I swear I can feel my muscle being broken down. Is this a thing??” Sam asked in the online forum. “I actually feel less firm, more wobbly and flabby. I seem to have less definition,“ they said. “Is this just a necessary evil to weight loss?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="why-i-reported-this-story" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why I reported this story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;GLP-1 drugs are undeniably exciting, and they are being widely adopted. I recently found out a family member of my own had started taking them, and they’re not the kind of person who’s susceptible to diet fads either. As a reporter, that makes me nervous: Anything that sounds too good to be true probably is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;It would be wonderful if GLP-1 drugs could cure Alzheimer’s, but we probably need to think through the trade-offs. And I started to pick up from other reporting and social media feeds I follow that some people were experiencing this unexpected muscle loss. I thought it would be valuable to unpack the science to explain why this happens to some people and explain what they can do to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The internet is filled with examples just like this. “Anyone else having a hard time working out on Wegovy?” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1f2o8pu/muscle_recovery/"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; one Reddit poster last year. They even felt their arms were weaker while bowling. Another person &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1lgawf4/comment/myvkodv/"&gt;realized&lt;/a&gt; something was wrong when they could no longer do yard work around the house. Other people have &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1msh9a5/anyone_experiencing_muscle_weakness_since_starting/"&gt;noticed&lt;/a&gt; leg weakness after light walking or climbing the stairs: “I actually struggle to go up a staircase and I’m only 32,” said one GLP-1 patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I know a lot of people are working out, and I do need to begin exercising on top of the wegovy, but I’m just wondering if anyone else is experiencing extreme weakness or if it’s just me and my un-toned self,” they asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Sam’s post in particular had a lot of comments, with one respondent even urging the patient to reconsider: You are “a strong, capable goddess. You don’t need to lose weight.” Accept who you are. In response, Sam laid out the dilemma that so many people who have sought to lose weight over the years face: “Unfortunately, some of us just do NOT lose weight with diet and exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s true: Weight loss is not assured from diet and exercise. Some people &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK573068/"&gt;have a genetic disposition&lt;/a&gt; to becoming obese. And not everybody who is obese is unhealthy; the body mass index is an imperfect measurement, and some people who are technically obese can still be healthy if much of their weight is muscle. Still, the realization that obesity is a disease to be treated, rather than a personal failure that can only be remedied through personal growth, has been important in reducing the prejudices that overweight people have long faced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But at the same time, it is a slippery slope from acknowledging diet and exercise may not be sufficient on their own to thinking a drug like Ozempic can make them unnecessary. Some people, like Sam, have always exercised and viewed GLP-1s as an extra push to help them reach their weight goals. But I also encountered other people who did not necessarily have healthy habits before but were able with the drugs to cut weight for the first time. One patient on Reddit &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1ee76tc/about_muscle_loss/"&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that they don’t work out and they don’t adhere to a particular diet. They have been losing weight, but they are “scared” about losing too much weight — so they ask if they can just eat more chicken or drink a protein shake and regain the muscle “without working out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;They have reason for concern: The same clinical trials that have shown how effective GLP-1 drugs are with weight loss have also consistently reported muscle loss or weakness among patients. When one group of researchers evaluated the type of body mass that patients on semaglutide drugs were losing, they &lt;a href="https://ir.verupharma.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/225/veru-announces-positive-topline-data-from-phase-2b-quality"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that about 40 percent was important muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The GLP-1 market is only going to grow as the drugs prove useful for a wide array of treatments. People, including those who are not overweight, may take them preventively to stave off cardiovascular disease or dementia. For them, people who are already at a healthy weight, muscle loss is an even more serious concern. If GLP-1 drugs do prove to be promising for treating age-related cognitive decline, for example, then appropriate diet and exercise will be even more paramount for that patient population. The last thing we want is more seniors suffering catastrophic injuries during a fall because of lost muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But understanding what exactly is causing the muscle loss is important. Scientists are still figuring that out, but early indications are that the cause is not the drugs themselves, then some of the lifestyle changes the drugs can lead to..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One study from researchers at the University of Utah suggests the loss of strength is largely the result of not eating enough calories. In their research on mice, they &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/newsroom/news/2025/08/new-study-raises-questions-about-how-ozempic-affects-muscle-size-and-strength"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; less muscle mass loss than expected. Instead, after taking a GLP-1, mice were losing their functional strength — how much they could lift or move around — even when muscle size stayed the same. In other words, the mice appeared weaker even though their muscle mass hadn’t changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Strength is not just a factor of how much muscle you have, but whether you can move that muscle effectively. There’s an energetic component to it,” lead author Katsu Funai told me. The animals on a GLP-1 drug may have had less energy because they were eating less — and therefore they wouldn’t be able to exert as much force with their muscles. It’s not the GLP-1s per se; it’s what the GLP-1s lead to without intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The findings could inform how we prescribe Ozempic, Funai said: Smaller doses might help to mitigate the loss of functional strength. Otherwise, losing weight too quickly is going to mean losing &lt;em&gt;energy&lt;/em&gt; quickly — and therefore feeling weaker. In the excitement over Ozempic, and the potential to lose a lot of weight and fast, people seem to have forgotten a fundamental truth about weight loss: “More is not necessarily better,” Funai said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Before GLP-1 drugs existed at all, dieticians urged their patients to pace weight loss — no more than 1-2 pounds per week — for exactly this reason: You don’t want to end up malnourished and weakened. With a conventional diet, that can often lead to you eating more, which in turn eliminates the weight loss. But when your appetite is suppressed by GLP-1s, the weight loss can continue, and with it, strength and energy loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“With these GLP-1s, that conversation [about diet and exercise] has been sidelined,” Funai said. “There are nuances to these things that I think are being missed not just from the public, but also from scientists,”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="how-to-make-the-most-of-glp-1s" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;How to make the most of GLP-1s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Ironically, the very problem that GLP-1s were meant to overcome — that many Americans simply struggle to eat right and exercise enough — remains just as central even with the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And many of the people taking GLP-1s are starting at a disadvantage: Only 49 percent of Americans &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/05/07/americans-on-healthy-food-and-eating/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; they are extremely or very confident that they know what a healthy diet looks like, and about twice as many &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2017/02/02/americans-health-care-behaviors-and-use-of-conventional-and-alternative-medicine-2/#:~:text=Two%2Dthirds%20(66%25)%20of,say%20it%20is%20somewhat%20important"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; they should get more exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If your sole goal is to lose weight, a GLP-1 alone could get you there — but not in the healthiest way. Unless you change what you eat, you’re still putting the same junk in your body — albeit less of it — with the same or more negative effects on your energy and stamina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“If you don’t change your behavior, if you don’t change your habits, you may be looking good, you may be losing weight, but metabolically, your body is in turmoil,” said Nayan Patel, a pharmacist who works with patients taking the drugs. “We’ve got to use these drugs in the right manner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So what should people on GLP-1s aim to eat? A high-protein diet delivering a lot of amino acids is important, Patel said: Eggs, nuts, lentils, poultry, and fish are all good sources. You can cut down on the carbs and sugars; your body won’t need them to produce energy because you’ll be cutting fat. Eating protein and strength training allows your body to be more effective at trimming the fat, without compromising your core strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Like anything hard but worth doing, there’s a lot to overcome. Many Americans have become intimidated by gym culture, so they might prefer to work out in privacy, at home — but they don’t know how. One person I encountered posted online to crowdsource advice on home equipment and routines. They said they didn’t want to go to a gym, but “I know I’m out of shape,” the poster confessed to&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1id8100/muscle_loss_weakness/"&gt; their fellow Redditors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The thread flooded with advice from simple workout routines to try to role models they could follow on social media. The advice included some very approachable strategies — something as simple as sitting in a chair with your legs outstretched and using your abdominal muscles to lift them from side to side over a water bottle. Some commenters recommended incorporating a resistance band and a workout ball. Health care providers have developed general recommendations for patients taking a GLP-1 drug: Mass General, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/news/article/fitness-for-people-taking-glp-1-agonists"&gt;advises&lt;/a&gt; a mixture of 150 minutes a week of moderate exercise — activities like walking or riding a bike — &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; about 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise like jogging or swimming laps in addition to two days of weight training and a steady dose of stretching and flexibility workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While I found plenty of people concerned with unexpected muscle loss, there were also &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1e5gycg/when_people_say_people_on_ozempic_and_wegovy_have/"&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; of patients proudly showing off their lean and muscular new physiques. It can be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;But in this vision, GLP-1s are a jumpstart, not a shortcut. “Losing weight is everybody’s goal.

These meetings are normally technical, evidence-based, and grounded in predictable procedures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in recent months, in a shift fueled by health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/11/rfk-jr-names-new-acip-members-replaces-cdc-vaccine-experts-he-just-fired/"&gt;growing influence over the committee&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/20/cdc-vaccine-safety-website-promotes-debunked-autism-link/"&gt;CDC’s public-facing materials&lt;/a&gt;, ACIP has drifted toward something more concerning: inflating speculative risks while downplaying well-established vaccine benefits. This imbalance has already surfaced in procedural irregularities, unsupported proposals, and confusing CDC communications, with the potential to disrupt vaccine access and public confidence at a time of rising infectious disease threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has positioned himself as a champion of scientific rigor and radical transparency. Yet his early actions at the CDC tell a different story. He &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/21/rfk-jr-ordered-vaccines-autism-cdc-website-change/"&gt;personally ordered&lt;/a&gt; revisions to CDC vaccine-safety webpages and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/covid-shots-pregnant-women-children-recommendation-change-hhs-secretary-kennedy/"&gt;announced changes to Covid-19 vaccine guidance&lt;/a&gt; — without new evidence and without CDC subject-matter review. These unilateral moves bypass the scientific guardrails and rigor he claims to value.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result: CDC publications now introduce ambiguity where none exists. ACIP, though technically independent, can’t ignore an official website that implies uncertainty about &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/03/vaccine-autism-rfk-jr-how-science-proves-vaccines-do-not-cause-autism/"&gt;long-settled science on vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. Kennedy has effectively created a policy-shaping source document that carries the CDC seal without CDC oversight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/26/cdc-acip-rfk-vaccines-public-health-policy-changes/"&gt;June meeting&lt;/a&gt; offered the first signs of a committee losing its footing. New members revisited and re-voted on issues the following day, evidence frameworks were sidelined, and voting language was drafted on the fly rather than through the normal public comment process. The September meeting went off the rails with impromptu presentations of data that lacked substantial evidence or peer review. When a scientific body stops following its own procedures, rigor and transparency both slip, and public trust erodes.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The only formal vote at the Dec. 4-5 meeting involves the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/02/cdc-acip-meeting-hepatitis-b-shots-vaccine-integrity-project/"&gt;hepatitis B vaccine birth dose&lt;/a&gt;. However, loosely defined sessions on “CDC Vaccine Risk Monitoring Evaluation,” “Vaccine Schedule History,” and the “Childhood/Adolescent Immunization Schedule” could invite misapplied risk framing, especially given the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/20/cdc-vaccine-safety-website-promotes-debunked-autism-link/"&gt;CDC website’s new, ambiguous language&lt;/a&gt; that mirrors terminology previously seen on a &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/anti-science/fake-cdc-vaccine-site-linked-anti-vax-nonprofit-once-headed-rfk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;“fake CDC website” linked to anti-vaccine groups&lt;/a&gt;. Even if the committee takes no drastic action, raising fringe concerns in an official forum can legitimize their ideological questions, an increasingly common tactic among newer members.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Misguided discussions don’t remain theoretical. They shape public perception, influence future votes, and trigger ripple effects in vaccine supply and coverage. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Altering the hepatitis B birth dose could destabilize the entire childhood schedule. Combination vaccines that include hepatitis B depend on stable timing. If timing shifts, combination products may become unusable, forcing a return to single-dose formulations that the U.S. currently lacks the capacity to produce. Manufacturing new standalone vaccines could take months to years, leaving gaps in protection and risking increases in hepatitis B and other vaccine preventable infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aluminum, a critical adjuvant component of many routine childhood vaccines with decades of safety data, remains a favorite target among those alleging undefined dangers. Removing adjuvants would require new formulations, clinical trials, and regulatory review, jeopardizing availability of vaccines for hepatitis A and B, HPV, pneumococcal disease, meningococcal disease, and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such instability could send manufacturers a clear signal that the U.S. is no longer a predictable environment for vaccine production leading to fewer manufacturers and fewer available vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s revised vaccine-autism language, while not explicitly claiming causation, strongly implies that science cannot rule it out. This rhetorical device contradicts extensive evidence and opens the door for petitions to add autism to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) injury table, potentially unleashing tens of thousands of claims unsupported by science. VICP, the system that provides financial compensation to people who have been seriously injured by certain vaccines, could be depleted, and manufacturers might reconsider continuing in the U.S. market. This is more than poor communication; it sets the stage for litigation that undermines both science and vaccine access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reversing this trend in vaccine policy requires immediate and coordinated action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, the scientific community must reaffirm the proven benefits of routine vaccination, especially the hepatitis B birth dose, which prevents infections from mothers, caregivers, and household contacts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, professional societies and public health organizations should prepare clear statements countering misconceptions likely to surface during or after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, CDC leadership must restore scientific credibility by ensuring website content reflects peer-reviewed evidence, not political pressure or manufactured ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health institutions now face a choice: reinforce trust through evidence-based practice or erode it by elevating speculation over science. The path forward is clear: follow evidence, uphold process, communicate clearly, and keep the mission focused on protecting the health of the American people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the upcoming ACIP meeting, the committee must resist raising hypothetical risks not grounded in rigorous science, while burying real, lifesaving benefits. The country deserves better — and our public health system depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;

On Monday, Milhoan was named the new ACIP chair, replacing Martin Kuldorff, a biostatistician who &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-appointed-cdc-vaccine-panel-says-will-scrutinize-childhood-vac-rcna214941" target="_blank"&gt;previously cast doubt on childhood vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, including the one for hepatitis B. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4096bf" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Sean O’Leary, a pediatric infectious disease expert and spokesman for the American Academy of Pediatrics, said he has never seen a serious reaction after “thousands of babies” have been given the hepatitis B vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e52e33" class="body-graf"&gt;“I never once saw a fever actually associated with hepatitis B vaccine,” O’Leary said at a media briefing Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-17bddc" class="body-graf"&gt;And a review of more than 400 studies found no evidence that the birth dose of the vaccines causes any short- or long-term health problems. On the contrary, the review of research, published Tuesday by the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/groups-organize-form-unbiased-independent-vaccine-panel-rcna212468" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/a&gt;, an independent group of experts led by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, found that giving newborns the hepatitis B vaccine has prevented more than 6 million infections and nearly 1 million hospitalizations. The paper was not published in a peer-reviewed journal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-478148" class="body-graf"&gt;ACIP is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday. The committee makes recommendations to the CDC director, who can then choose whether to adopt them. While a vote against newborn vaccination does not prohibit doctors from administering the shot, the panel’s recommendations influence insurance coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e41d92" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear whether the ACIP members would vote to eliminate or delay that first dose of a hepatitis B vaccine by a month or two. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-12-01-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;agenda posted online as of Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; described the meeting in broad strokes, offering no details about who would be presenting data. A &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-panel-hep-b-babies-data-rcna232394" target="_blank"&gt;vote on the vaccine&lt;/a&gt; was supposed to take place at an ACIP meeting in September, but it was tabled because of confusion among committee members. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e92349" class="body-graf"&gt;Hepatitis B can spread through sexual contact and sharing drug paraphernalia, such as needles. It can also pass from person to person if they share common household items such as toothbrushes or razors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-79ce28" class="body-graf"&gt;Milhoan said any decision to give newborns hepatitis B vaccines should be made based on clinicians’ individual assessments of the babies’ risk for infection — that is, whether a pregnant woman tests positive for the infection or has a “questionable infectious disease background.” At September’s ACIP meeting, the panel voted unanimously to recommend testing all pregnant women for hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3674af" class="body-graf"&gt;But not all pregnant women receive prenatal care, and if they do, not all feel comfortable speaking frankly with their doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-14553c" class="body-graf"&gt;Milhoan appeared to dismiss the argument that women may not divulge activities that could increase their risk for hepatitis B because of stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-74bf85" class="body-graf"&gt;“I hope they love their baby more than they love their pride,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6e56dd" class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2738558" target="_blank"&gt;2019 report&lt;/a&gt; showed that just 84% to 88% of pregnant women are tested for the virus. Without vaccination, 90% of babies exposed to the hepatitis B virus during birth develop chronic hepatitis, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-hepatitis-b-vaccine-given-to-newborns-reduces-risk-of-chronic-infection/#:~:text=Newborns%20infected%20with%20hepatitis%20B,will%20die%20from%20the%20disease." target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1f0b12" class="body-graf"&gt;The hepatitis B vaccine is not the only immunization Milhoan has cast doubt on. He is a senior fellow at the Independent Medical Alliance — formerly known as the Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance — a group that has advocated for unproven treatments for Covid. His &lt;a href="https://imahealth.org/experts/kirk-milhoan/" target="_blank"&gt;biography on the IMA’s website&lt;/a&gt; says he “is dedicated to treating patients affected by acute SARS-CoV-2 infections, Long Covid, and vaccine-related cardiovascular toxicity due to the spike protein.” Last year, he participated in an &lt;a href="https://crescentcitytimes.com/special-event-covid-hearings/" target="_blank"&gt;event with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene&lt;/a&gt;, R-Ga., about alleged injuries associated with the shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b55413" class="body-graf"&gt;Milhoan has been especially critical of Covid vaccines for their link to a small but increased risk of a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/heart-issues-common-covid-infection-vaccination-cdc-reports-rcna21558" target="_blank"&gt;heart condition called myocarditis&lt;/a&gt; in young men. The link was not seen in clinical trials; it was detected in 2021, soon after the shots were made available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ae0a52" class="body-graf"&gt;“The rates of myocarditis were much higher than anyone thought,” Milhoan said. He said he was labeled an “anti-vaxxer” for speaking out about the potential risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-191097" class="body-graf"&gt;“People were saying, ‘Are you against the vaccines?’ I’m just trying to show you what we’re seeing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2a085c" class="body-graf"&gt;Over the weekend, Dr. Vinay Prasad, the vaccine chief at the Food and Drug Administration, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-covid-vaccines-children-deaths-rcna246437" target="_blank"&gt;told staff members in a memo that an internal review&lt;/a&gt; found that at least 10 children died “after and because of” Covid vaccines and suggested the deaths were tied to myocarditis. Prasad did not provide any evidence to back up the claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d25dfc" class="body-graf"&gt;Studies have shown that myocarditis is more commonly associated with Covid infection than vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1c47b3" class="body-graf"&gt;This week’s ACIP meeting is also expected to include discussion of the use of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines. The ingredient is added to prompt the immune system to react better to vaccines. A &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00997" target="_blank"&gt;study of more than 1 million people&lt;/a&gt;, published over the summer, found that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/study-finds-no-link-aluminum-vaccines-autism-asthma-rcna218682" target="_blank"&gt;aluminum adjuvants were not linked to an increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of 50 chronic conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allergies and autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-15d89e" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The meeting follows months of upheaval within the CDC, including mass firings and significant changes to its messaging. On Nov. 19, a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/autism.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC webpage&lt;/a&gt; that once stated unequivocally that vaccines do not cause autism &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-autism-vaccines-webpage-studies-changes-language-rcna244936" target="_blank"&gt;was rewritten&lt;/a&gt; to suggest, without evidence, that health officials had “ignored” possible links between the shots and the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNVFJVVnhlMFlzUXk3dGsyTmxPQWdWSFZ4SHdJZm9acGtVX3Z6cmdoS3M4YnYxRE85TERBVXJBVnpUNE1OQUJDVlkwNjk3bWIzZGx4bkF3MGkzcjFwMThzZ2djZTRGSlpDRV96cHd3TGg1b2FHNnBLZzlrOUZVdHNTX1hQRVhQd190NzhfUkVJTUgzVWZmcXFHRmJlQWNkSWZ1blVZbmo3MDItWnNHOG9XeHpHLTJIV0ZRVWfSAVZBVV95cUxQR2FBRFhLLTZsbkhhYUtlQXlBTXJmd0ZqQ29fSE9yeG9VaTRIc2N5TXkxbmFlelVQZEw3OVpfaktWQ3pKaTZLRTlpdm8yMWd5UHYzX0JqUQ</guid></item><item><title>医生警告推迟为新生儿注射乙型肝炎疫苗可能会重现致命的威胁- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/12/03/nx-s1-5629005/acip-hepatitis-b-rfk-jr-childhood-vaccine-schedule-liver-failure-newborns</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory panel appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is scheduled to discuss and vote on the hepatitis B birth dose recommendation during its two-day meeting starting Dec. 4, potentially limiting children's access.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Working out of a &lt;a href="https://anmc.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;tribal-owned hospital&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Anchorage, Alaska, liver specialist Brian McMahon has spent decades treating the long shadow of hepatitis B. Before a vaccine became available in the 1980s, he saw the virus claim young lives in western Alaskan communities with stunning speed.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;One of his patients was 17 years old when he first examined her for stomach pain. McMahon discovered she had developed liver cancer caused by hepatitis B, just weeks before she was set to graduate from high school as valedictorian. She died before the ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McMahon thinks often of an 8-year-old boy who showed no signs of illness until he complained of pain from what turned out to be a rapidly growing tumor on his liver.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McMahon can still hear his voice.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"He was moaning in pain, saying, 'I know I am going to die soon,'" he recalled. "We were all crying." The boy died at home a week later.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The hepatitis B virus is transmitted through blood and bodily fluids, even in microscopic amounts, and the virus can survive on surfaces for a week. Like many of his patients, McMahon said, both children contracted hepatitis B at birth or in early childhood.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That outcome is now preventable. A birth dose of the vaccine, recommended for newborns since 1991, is up to &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/hospitalpediatrics/article/11/5/446/180718/Improving-Timeliness-of-Hepatitis-B-Vaccine-Birth" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;90% effective&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in preventing infection from the mother if given in the first 24 hours of life. If babies receive all three doses, &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-hepatitis-b-vaccine-given-to-newborns-reduces-risk-of-chronic-infection/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;98% of them&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have immunity from the incurable virus, with the protection lasting at least &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/ask-experts/topic/hepb/vaccine-recommendations-hepb/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;30 years&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the communities of western Alaska, years of targeted testing and widespread vaccination efforts led to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12549388/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the number of cases plummeting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Liver cancer has disappeared in children," McMahon said. "We haven't seen a case since 1995. Nor do we have any children under 30 that have gotten infected that we know of."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He worries those hard-won gains could soon be rolled back.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Pushing Back the Dose?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory panel appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is scheduled &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-11-14-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;to discuss and vote on&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the hepatitis B birth dose recommendation during its two-day meeting starting Dec. 4, potentially limiting children's access.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;On Tucker Carlson's podcast in June, Kennedy falsely claimed that the hepatitis B birth dose is a "likely culprit" of autism.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He also said the hepatitis B virus is not "casually contagious." But &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/02-langer-hep-b-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;decades of research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows the virus can be transmitted through indirect contact, when traces of infected fluids like blood enter the body when people share personal items like razors or toothbrushes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The committee's recommendations carry weight. Most private insurers must cover the vaccines the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices endorses, and many state vaccination policies are directly linked to its guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Neither ACIP nor the CDC is regulatory. They cannot mandate immunizations. It's &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/state-health-policy-data/a-look-at-recent-changes-to-state-vaccine-requirements-for-school-children/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;up to states&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to do that. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But keeping the recommendation for a hepatitis B vaccine at birth preserves the widest range of options for families. They can choose to vaccinate at birth, wait until later in childhood, or not vaccinate at all, and insurance will continue to cover the cost of the shot as long as it remains approved by the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Two senior FDA officials — Commissioner Marty Makary and top vaccine regulator Vinay Prasad — suggested at the end of November that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/11/29/nx-s1-5624998/fda-vaccines-covid-children-safety" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;changes to&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the vaccine approval process may be coming. Vaccines must be approved by the FDA to be administered in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/3042d15c-676b-48ac-8148-1a2204ef420e.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;internal agency emails&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; obtained by &lt;a href="https://x.com/AliRogin/status/1994567973030535301?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PBS NewsHour&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/29/fda-vaccine-approval-child-covid-deaths/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Prasad questioned the routine practice of "giving multiple vaccines at the same time." It's not clear whether he was referring to combination vaccines that offer immunity against multiple diseases with a single shot. Three of the nine hepatitis B vaccines currently approved by the FDA are combination vaccines. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/perinatal-provider-overview/vaccine-administration.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;birth dose&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the hepatitis B vaccine is given only as a stand-alone vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Contacted for comment, Health and Human Services spokesman Emily G. Hilliard said in a statement that "ACIP will review the evidence at its meeting this week and issue recommendations based on gold standard, evidence-based science and common sense."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;'Sowing Distrust'&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If private insurers opt to still cover the shot, misinformation from the meeting still could lead families to falsely believe the vaccine could harm their babies, said &lt;a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/accords/about/faculty-staff-directory/O-Leary-Sean-UCD11631" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sean O'Leary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Whatever comes out of this disaster of a meeting in December is going to be mainly designed around sowing distrust and spreading fear," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump, Kennedy, and some newly appointed ACIP members have &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/hepatitis-b-vaccine-debate-cdc-birth-dose-exposure-risk-acip-vote/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;mischaracterized how the liver disease spreads&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, ignoring or downplaying the risk of transmission through indirect contact. The hepatitis B virus is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/media/HepBSexualHealth.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;far more infectious&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than HIV. Unvaccinated people, including children, can get infected from microscopic amounts of blood on a tabletop or toy, even when the infected person is asymptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McMahon has cared for children who tested negative at birth and later became infected through indirect contact. In a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3973412/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study in the 1970s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, nearly a third of such children went on to develop chronic hepatitis B without ever showing symptoms, he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's a very infectious virus," McMahon said. "That's why giving everybody the birth dose is the best way to prevent it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC recommends that all pregnant people be screened for hepatitis B, but it estimates that up to 16% are not tested and fall through the cracks. O'Leary and other experts say testing mothers for the virus shortly before or after delivery is unfeasible, because most hospitals lack the staff and resources.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The three-dose vaccine has a &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-hepatitis-b-vaccine-given-to-newborns-reduces-risk-of-chronic-infection/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;long track record&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of safety. Numerous studies show it is not associated with an increased risk of &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/pidj/fulltext/2004/07000/lack_of_association_between_hepatitis_b_birth.12.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;infant death&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/pidj/fulltext/2001/11000/safety_of_neonatal_hepatitis_b_vaccine.9.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fever or sepsis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/571612" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17192842/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;autoimmune conditions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and severe reactions are rare.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have an incredible safety profile," O'Leary said. "No one expects to get in a car wreck, right? And yet we all put our seat belts on. This is similar."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The CDC estimates that 2.4 million people in the U.S. have hepatitis B and that half &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/about/index.html#:~:text=About%201%20in%202%20people%20with%20hepatitis%20B%20do%20not%20know%20they%20are%20infected." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;do not know&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; they are infected. The disease can range from an acute infection to a chronic one, often with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/clinical-signs/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;few to no symptoms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If left untreated, it can lead to serious conditions such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. There is no cure. Treatment can sometimes involve &lt;a href="https://www.hepatitisb.uw.edu/go/hbv/medications-used-to-treat-hbv/core-concept/all" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;antiviral or immunomodulatory medications&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, if the benefits outweigh the risk of severe side effects.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Expert's Advice to Parents: Talk to a Doctor&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some parents may struggle to understand why a healthy newborn needs a vaccine so soon after birth, especially for a virus they feel certain they don't have and often wrongly associate only with risky behaviors, said &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;William Schaffner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of preventative medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and a former voting member of ACIP. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those perceptions, Schaffner said, mix with declining trust in public health and rising skepticism about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His advice to expectant parents who are on the fence is to talk to their doctor about the shots. Even if the pregnant woman has tested negative, he said, it's still important to give the baby the birth dose, because false negatives are possible and because the virus can spread so easily from surface contact. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Babies who receive the full vaccine series starting from birth have their chance of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4280122/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;liver cancer reduced by 84%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you wait a month and if the mom happens to be positive, or the baby picks it up from a caregiver, by that time the infection is established in that baby's liver," Schaffner said. "It's too late to prevent that infection."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He said that if fewer people get vaccinated, hepatitis B will circulate at higher rates in American communities and the risk of contracting the virus will rise for everyone who doesn't get the shots.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;More hepatitis B cases could mean higher costs for patients and the broader health care system. The CDC estimates treating someone with a less severe form of the disease costs $25,000 to $94,000 per year. For patients who require a liver transplant, annual medical expenses can climb above $320,000, depending on their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the past 30 years, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-09-18-19/02-su-hep-b-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;main adverse events&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; parents have reported from their babies receiving the birth dose have been fussiness and crying, both of which pass quickly. Schaffner said that's a very strong safety profile — for a newborn vaccine with a track record of protecting babies from an incurable disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The data are so clear about this," Schaffner said.

She was inspired by innovative molecular tools that would allow her to investigate the contributions of another, more mysterious group of cells called astrocytes. What she discovered about their role in learning and memory excited her even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03633-0" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51778150.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;The computers that run on human brain cells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, she felt like an outsider, especially at conferences. She imagined colleagues thinking, “Oh, that’s the weird one who works on astrocytes,” says Goshen, whose laboratory is at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. A lot of people were sceptical, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not any more. A rush of studies from labs in many subfields are revealing just how important these cells are in shaping our behaviour, mood and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03366-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03366-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;. Long thought of as support cells, astrocytes are emerging as key players in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Neurons and neural circuits are the main &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03425-y" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03425-y" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;computing units of the brain&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s now clear just how much astrocytes shape that computation,” says neurobiologist Nicola Allen at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, who has spent her career researching astrocytes and other non-neuronal cells, collectively called glial cells. “Glial meetings are now consistently oversubscribed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Out of the shadows&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far back as the nineteenth century, scientists could see with their simple microscopes that mammalian brains included two major &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03073-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03073-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;types of cell&lt;/a&gt; — neurons and glia — in roughly equal numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twentieth-century technologies generated most of the excitement around neurons. Researchers studying the cells’ electrical activity showed how they create the complex networks that underlie all brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When neurons are activated, electrical signals zap down their length at lightning speed, causing their synapses to release chemical neurotransmitters. Some of these, such as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02161-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02161-5" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;glutamate&lt;/a&gt;, excite neighbouring neurons, whereas others, such as GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid), inhibit them. The development of a technique called patch clamping in the 1970s and 1980s, in which electrodes are inserted into individual cells to measure the flow of ions across membranes, let researchers probe this neurotransmission in unprecedented detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01468-3" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51349062.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Brain tissues, assemble! Inside the push to build better brain models&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, glial cells seemed to be electrically silent and were dismissed as dull by most researchers. Some glia, called oligodendrocytes, coat and insulate neurons. Others, the microglia, provide the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01502-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01502-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;brain’s immune system&lt;/a&gt;. The many functions of astrocytes proved more elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although few brain scientists focused on astrocytes until well into the 2000s, some fundamental discoveries were made before that&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Under the light microscope, astrocytes look star-shaped, stretching between neurons and tiny blood vessels in the brain. They signal blood vessels to increase or decrease their flow according to neuronal activity and extract oxygen and other life-giving molecules from the blood to ship to neurons. They clear up waste products from around the synapses and regulate ion levels there. They extract glutamate from around the neurons to stop the excitatory circuits from going into overdrive, break the neurotransmitter down and then return its building blocks to the neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes started to look more interesting when it became possible to measure calcium movements in cells. Those measurements revealed that astrocytes use fluctuations in their calcium levels to signal to each other and to other cells in response to certain molecules in their environment, such as an excess of neurotransmitters (see ‘Signals from the stars’). These calcium signals, which move slowly compared with those that pass between neurons, turn out to have big consequences. They drive many activities, including the release of further signalling molecules, ions, metabolites and other factors that affect how neurons, other glial cells and blood vessels behave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51771876.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51771876.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Signals from the stars.

But over the past decade or so, ever-more-precise research tools have revealed a different, more complex story. Many scientists who had previously focused exclusively on neurons are now using these tools to investigate how astrocytes contribute to animal physiology and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No evidence emerged to support a role for astrocytes in ultrafast neurotransmission. Instead, it is becoming ever clearer that astrocytes orchestrate the molecular mix in the environment around synapses on timescales much slower than neuronal signalling, varying that mix according to brain state — how alert or awake the brain is, for example. This, in turn, can determine whether neurons fire in response to a signal coming across the synapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advances in microscopy have shown just how closely astrocytes are associated with neurons. Beyond their star-shaped core, astrocytes have an intricate architecture with many branches that extend into tiny, delicate structures, called leaflets, that are only tens of nanometres wide. At this resolution, astrocytes, which make up one-quarter of all brain cells, look less like stars and more like bushy spheres, and they fill all the available space between neurons without overlapping with each other&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In the human brain, each astrocyte can contact up to two million synapses. What’s more, there are different types of astrocyte in different brain areas&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03641-0" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51778156.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;First-ever atlas of brain development shows how stem cells turn into neurons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vast reach of astrocytes has profound consequences in the brain, says neuroscientist Baljit Khakh at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Form follows function in biology.” His lab has developed many of the molecular and genetic tools that allow particular calcium signalling pathways in astrocytes to be switched on or off, letting scientists see what each pathway does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons might transmit the signals that drive brain function, but it is now clear that astrocytes fine-tune those signals by altering the environment around the synapses, says neuroscientist Hongkui Zeng, director of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, Washington. “That is why it is important to learn about all brain cells, not just the neurons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Clocks, learning and memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As just one example, astrocytes resolved an open question in the field of circadian biology. How does the body’s master clock, a cluster of cells in the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) that regulates biological cycles in a roughly 24-hour rhythm, keep its circular loop? “It was a mystery,” says circadian biologist Michael Hastings at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The master-clock system is made up almost exclusively of neurons that release the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, and no one could see how a system that apparently does nothing but suppress neuronal activity could create a daily cycle. Biological clocks need a feedback mechanism so that they can generate rhythmic cycles autonomously, without needing an external signal every day to restart them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, Marco Brancaccio, a postdoctoral researcher working with Hastings, read about a glutamate detector — a fluorescent probe called ‘glue sniffer’, or iGluSnFR. Brancaccio proposed using the detector to sniff out any glutamate that might be present in the mouse brain slices the team was studying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I told Marco it would be a waste of time, because there wouldn’t be any,” recalls Hastings. “Fortunately he ignored me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brancaccio, who is now at Imperial College London, found plenty of glutamate — and to general astonishment, found that its levels were as rhythmic as those of GABA. But whereas the GABA levels were highest during the day, glutamate levels peaked at night&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We scratched our heads. Where could that glutamate be coming from?” says Hastings. It didn’t take them long to discover through a literature search that the source must be astrocytes, a cell type they hadn’t thought much about before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This set the researchers on a series of ever-more sophisticated experiments. They ultimately concluded that astrocytes support the SCN clock by switching on their uptake systems for GABA by day and turning them off at night&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51762654.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51762654.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Micrograph of clumps of astrocytes which have the appearance of the tops of bushy trees in a forest, with complex branch structures, coloured in greens, yellows, oranges and reds." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03912-w/d41586-025-03912-w_51762654.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Different astrocyte types, with their thousands of branches and leaflets, pack together to fill the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: B. Khakh Laboratory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Particularly intriguing are studies that are revealing how astrocytes support the many subtleties of learning and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00292-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00292-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;. In one of her first key experiments with the new tools, Goshen and her team were amazed to discover how astrocytes in the brains of mice encode information about the spatial location of rewards. When a mouse had already learnt where to find a water reward, the calcium activity in its astrocytes gradually increased as it approached the reward, the scientists found. But the researchers measured no increase when the mouse moved towards the same reward in a new environment&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The finding raises interesting questions about how astrocytes are involved in the encoding of spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, groups in Japan and the United States reported that astrocytes help with the stabilization and recall of memories primed by fear&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Because the astrocytes’ signals are much slower than the electrical signals of neurons — sometimes developing over hours or even days rather than milliseconds — they are well suited to bridging the time gap between learning and remembering, says neuroscientist Jun Nagai at the RIKEN Centre for Brain Science in Wako, Japan, who led one of the studies. “Think of them as the brain’s long-exposure camera: they capture the trace of meaningful events that might otherwise fade too fast.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because neurons and astrocytes work together to process information, researchers have started to wonder whether astrocytes drive or exacerbate diseases that have been generally considered to be neuronal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            The US stillbirth rate dropped 2% last year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr041.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a hopeful improvement after a turbulent few years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve00043b6n8fqne0ai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But there were still nearly 20,000 fetal deaths in 2024, CDC data shows, more than 5.4 for every 1,000 live births and pregnancies with gestations longer than 20 weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve00053b6nwq61i6qu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That rate is the lowest it’s been in decades, but the CDC does not necessarily consider it to be a record low.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip8gck300013b6qen7u96rx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Stillbirths have been generally trending down in the US: The rate fell from 7.5 for every 1,000 live births and pregnancies with gestations longer than 20 weeks in 1990 down to 5.7 in 2019. But the rate ticked up in the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic and has fluctuated in the years since, and the decline in 2024 essentially brought the stillbirth rate back to where it was in 2022.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve00063b6nygmi65g6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the new CDC report, the decline in the stillbirth rate last year was driven by significant change in three states: Colorado, which had a 14% drop; Utah, which had a 16% drop, and Mississippi, which saw a 21% drop in fetal mortality between 2023 and 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve00073b6n40oe2uyt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite the decrease, Mississippi still has a higher stillbirth rate than any other state, at 7.8, but officials in the state are taking action. Earlier this year, Mississippi declared a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/22/health/infant-mortality-public-health-emergency-mississippi"&gt;public health emergency&lt;/a&gt; over the rising infant mortality rate. The move creates opportunities to mobilize resources to address the issue, such as investments to activate a standardized system for maternal and infant care and eliminate &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/10/health/maternity-care-crisis-march-of-dimes"&gt;maternity care deserts&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            And despite the nationwide improvement last year, especially in stillbirths during the third trimester, experts say much more work is needed to continue to bring the stillbirth rate down.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve00093b6nud32n68x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Stillbirths affect just as many families as do infant deaths each year,” said Ashley Stoneburner, director of applied research and analytics with March of Dimes, a nonprofit focused on infant and maternal health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve000a3b6nv0y97th3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a really large problem, and a lot of the risk factors that we see for infant mortality, especially very early infant deaths, are the same that we see for babies that are born still,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmip82tve000b3b6n9teidlpc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In September, the US National Institutes of Health launched a five-year, $37 million &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-launches-consortium-reduce-risk-stillbirth-us" target="_blank"&gt;Stillbirth Research Consortium&lt;/a&gt; to support efforts that reduce the risk of stillbirth.

            Research &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5785410/" target="_blank"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that about a quarter of stillbirths are preventable, but most — up to 60% – “remain unexplained even after exclusion of common causes, such as congenital abnormalities, genetic factors, and obstetric complications,” NIH said in a news release about the new consortium.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            ​Other factors that increase the risk for stillbirth include medical conditions among mothers — such as diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and substance use during pregnancy — as well as high levels of stress some environmental exposures including extreme heat and pollution, Stoneburner says.

            “There’s a lot of socioeconomic factors that increase the risk for stillbirth as well, and those are things like lack of access to health care or belonging to a certain ethnic minority groups,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            March of Dimes’ 2025 report card highlighted a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/17/health/prenatal-care-us-women-march-of-dimes"&gt;worrisome decline&lt;/a&gt; in the share of pregnant women who are receiving prenatal care in their first trimester and “persistent inequities and rising health risks.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The new CDC report shows that stillbirth rates have been consistently highest among mothers who are Black and those who are Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Rates of about 10 fetal deaths for every 1,000 live births and pregnancies with gestations longer than 20 weeks for these groups are twice as high as they are among mothers who are Asian, White or Hispanic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The rise of GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic and Mounjaro has been nothing short of meteoric. Originally developed to treat  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="183985" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, these drugs are now widely used for weight loss and have become household names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But alongside headlines of dramatic transformations are reports of an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and unwanted pregnancies after contraception failures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are the risks? And what should you do if you are taking these medicines?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-babies-heres-why-oral-contraceptives-might-be-failing"&gt;'Ozempic Babies': Here's Why Oral Contraceptives Might Be Failing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do these drugs work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) drugs are medicines used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. They work by reducing blood sugar levels and reducing appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five medicines in this category are approved for use in Australia:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mounjaro (tirzepatide)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ozempic (semaglutide)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wegovy (semaglutide)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saxenda (liraglutide)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trulicity (dulaglutide).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These drugs have been around for the &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/resources/artg/217965"&gt;past decade&lt;/a&gt; but rose in popularity in recent years, with the help of Hollywood celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common side effects of GLP-1 medicines are related to &lt;a href="https://www.ozempic.com/how-to-take/side-effects.html"&gt;digestion&lt;/a&gt;: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, indigestion, stomach pain and constipation. These tend to be mild and either go away with time or become more tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more concerning side effects have prompted Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/safety/safety-monitoring-and-information/safety-alerts/product-warnings-updated-glp-1-ra-class"&gt;issue new warnings this week&lt;/a&gt; about suicidal thoughts and the lower effectiveness of oral contraceptives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 12 months to November 2025, there were 20 cases of suicidal thoughts reported in the &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/safety/adverse-events/database-adverse-event-notifications-daen"&gt;Australian Database of Adverse Events Notifications&lt;/a&gt;, which coincided with the use of a GLP-1 medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is consistent with published scientific data. A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-75965-2"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found a link between GLP-1 medicines and a 106% increase in the risk of suicidal behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.23385"&gt;World Health Organization data&lt;/a&gt; also found a link between semaglutide use and suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183989" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183989" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/crying_woman_642.jpg" alt="crying woman" class="wp-image-183989 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/crying_woman_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/crying_woman_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183989" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Links between suicidal thoughts and GLP-1 drugs have been found in a number of studies, though others have found the opposite effect. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEAMO031Cg/"&gt;Karola G/Pexels/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all the evidence supports a link between GLP-1 drugs and suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38182782/"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; analysed the data of more than 1.8 million patients who were taking the medicines for either weight loss or diabetes. It found a lower, not higher, risk of new or recurring suicidal thoughts when compared with patients who were not taking a GLP-1 medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can these drugs affect contraception?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oral contraceptives work by using hormones to prevent the release of eggs from the ovaries and to thicken the cervical mucus. This latter effect makes it difficult for sperm to reach and fertilise an egg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects are only triggered when pregnancy-related hormones are at a high enough level. If GLP-1 medicines affect how the body absorbs hormones in oral contraceptives, hormone levels may not reach concentrations high enough to prevent pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers first raised the potential for GLP-1 medicines to affect oral contraceptives in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2023.10.037"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability of GLP-1 medicines to affect oral contraceptives may vary between drugs. A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2023.10.037"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; that examined the link between tirzepatide and oral contraception found that this specific drug had a higher impact on hormone absorption when compared with other GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183991" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183991" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/contraceptive_pills_green_packet_642.jpg" alt="pills" class="wp-image-183991 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/contraceptive_pills_green_packet_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/contraceptive_pills_green_packet_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183991" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some GLP-1 drugs may impact the absorption of hormones in oral contraceptive drugs. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEVhT8CjDo/"&gt;Olga Niekrasova/The Olga Niekrasova Collection/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study of semaglutide published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jcph.443"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt; found the drug did not affect the amount of hormone that was absorbed into the body when patients were given the commonly used oral contraceptive pills ethinylestradiol or levonorgestrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a more recent study in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/DDDT.S506957"&gt;2025&lt;/a&gt; concluded that both tirzepatide and oral semaglutide were able to affect oral contraceptive hormone levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs should not affect the efficacy of IUDs or other long-acting (implanted) contraceptives, as they are not reliant on hormones being absorbed from the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I'm taking one of these drugs, what should I do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TGA recommends that if you're taking GLP-1 medicines, you should tell your doctor if you experience new or worsening  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="183985" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, suicidal thoughts, or any unusual changes in mood or behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women taking the GLP-1 drug tirzepatide and oral contraceptives, the TGA advises either switching to a non-oral contraceptive (like an implant) or adding a barrier method of contraception for four weeks after first taking the GLP-1 medicine, or any time you increase the dose of tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A GLP-1 drug should not be used during pregnancy, as it &lt;a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2025/223/7/incidence-glp-1-receptor-agonist-use-women-reproductive-age-attending-general"&gt;may affect fetal growth&lt;/a&gt;. The adverse events database has also reported cases of miscarriages in women who were at the time taking semaglutide or tirzepatide.

Even so, no one could have guessed that the introduction would be capable of melting everyone's heart!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These new BFFs are two peas in a pod!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sandy couldn't have been any gentler with her tiny new friend. The way she "got smaller to make the baby feel safer" had commenters like @tarynbrookee reaching for the tissues, though no one was as moved as the proud moms raising such sweet souls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/sweet-pair-golden-retrievers-prove-231500886.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: Sweet Pair of Golden Retrievers Prove They're the Best Babysitters for One-Year-Old Baby Brother;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: Sweet Pair of Golden Retrievers Prove They're the Best Babysitters for One-Year-Old Baby Brother&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I don’t think the video picks up her constant whining," Kylie replied to a viewer, "but she was so excited and enamored."

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosf9do006t27p3flpg2qpo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            George Mycock’s fitness routine had gotten out of hand.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5q00083b6nph3k7qxd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The 22-year-old was terrified of putting on body fat but eager to develop more muscle. He tracked his food so thoroughly that he was weighing lettuce leaves. And he was exercising –– way too much, in fact.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00093b6npt6etozi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If I halved it, I’d still probably be doing the same, if not more, than what anyone else I knew who was going to the gym,” Mycock said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000a3b6n1og35dem@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As hard as he worked, he never felt satisfied. On the contrary, he often felt like he just didn’t have the discipline or character to reach his ever-changing body goals. He felt like a loser.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000b3b6nvtblvfxp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then he found himself pulling away from his friends at university and increasingly believing people would be better off without him, he said. He was experiencing suicidal thoughts when a friend dropped by unexpectedly to check on him.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000c3b6ndlhixj90@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just started crying in front of her … I just told her how awful I felt,” Mycock said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000d3b6nnmjpfi5e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That was the breakthrough moment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000e3b6n3ziiq2ym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At the time, I didn’t really know that it was necessarily about my body or about the eating. I just knew that I felt horrendous. I just thought I was pathetic loser. And she convinced me to get help.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000f3b6nwaxh6t07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mycock has never received a formal diagnosis for the condition –– he only knows of one person who has. But seven years later, as a researcher in the field and doctoral student at the University of Worcester in the United Kingdom, he understands his experience as muscle dysmorphia, which is sometimes called “bigorexia.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000g3b6nfx25d202@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Muscle dysmorphia occurs when an individual becomes obsessed with becoming muscular,” said Dr. Jason Nagata, associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine. Nagata is lead author of a review on the condition published in The Lancet Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Health Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000h3b6nqa9jul0v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The condition is often unrecognized and behaviors that go with it can even be praised, but the condition isn’t just about vanity, Mycock said. It is a mental health condition that can have serious consequences.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000i3b6nomvek5ew@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This type of dysmorphia can include extreme exercise behaviors, concern about being “scrawny” even if a person is objectively muscular, and the use of performance- or appearance-enhancing drugs, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000j3b6nzdd5olmy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Muscle dysmorphia is considered part of a family of eating and body image disorders that are often stereotyped as being restricted to thin, White, young women. But they can happen to anyone – and sometimes they go unnoticed because they can resemble behaviors society praises.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000k3b6nkdj13zup@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In moderation, exercise is healthy, and the goal is to find activities that feel enjoyable and sustainable over the long term,” Nagata said. “But with muscle dysmorphia, workouts can shift from something positive to something that causes more stress than joy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000l3b6nvcqcmm47@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many people, especially young men, find joy and community at the gym when they go to get fit, but some people can take it too far.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000m3b6no00oo1pz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead of looking forward to a workout, people with muscle dysmorphia may feel compelled to go because they worry about missing a session. Building muscle may start to get in the way of work, school or their relationships, Nagata said. People with this condition also may withdraw from social events or their usual activities because of concerns over their appearance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000n3b6n3hnic70e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When exercise starts to take over your life rather than support it, that’s a warning sign,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000o3b6nnzx7jdmw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The dominance of exercise over a person’s life is not without consequence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000p3b6nphqqwif3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Muscle dysmorphia is linked with a higher risk of depression, anxiety, substance use, and sometimes suicide risk, Nagata said. And the performance-enhancing drugs –– like anabolic steroids –– can have health consequences on the brain, such as irritability, aggression and paranoia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000q3b6nht32tgds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overexercise can lead to muscle or joint injuries, as well, he said. Steroid use can also damage the kidneys and liver and increase heart disease risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000r3b6ny6nowulp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is hard to tell when a desire to be muscular tips over into a disorder, because many people get the cultural message that appearance is important for social status and dating opportunities, said Dr. Kyle Ganson, assistant professor in the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work at the University of Toronto.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000s3b6nsitbxb6f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For a lot of young people, they think that their body needs to look a particular way in order to succeed,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000t3b6nxj4qq219@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Boys and young men in particular are at risk for muscle dysmorphia because of the specific societal pressures put on their bodies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000u3b6n823pglfx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most boys and then have generally higher drive for muscularity overall, like they want to go to the gym. They want to be more muscular based on sort of the ideal male body,” Ganson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000v3b6na33gz1s8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Weightlifting and body building increase the risk, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000w3b6nayach3sk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Competitive athletes are especially vulnerable, and the risk is even higher when training is focused on changing appearance rather than improving performance,” he said. “Those pressures around physique can make certain athletes more susceptible to developing unhealthy or obsessive relationships with their bodies.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000x3b6nm5aytseh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mycock’s problem with fitness began when he injured his spine playing rugby at 13 and had to miss a year of school to recover. When he returned, he noticed his peers weren’t treating him the same. People who would talk with him when he was in a smaller, more muscular body suddenly were not speaking with him as much, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000y3b6nqwnfe0ng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But when he started trying to lose weight, he found that he got more praise, to the point where his back surgeon joked about him coming in to teach other patients how to do it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000z3b6ncz19sznt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But little did he know that I was, at that point, basically starving myself and exercising multiple times a day,” Mycock said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00103b6n632nwdeu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not only was Mycock’s relationship with his body tied up with his identity as an athlete, but ideas of masculinity were at play, too, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00113b6nkdtpsikt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The fitness influencers he followed online spread the message that anyone could achieve the ideal masculine body if only they worked hard enough, were disciplined enough and were man enough, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00123b6ngkn7kkoi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the stricter Mycock got with his diet and exercise, the farther the goalpost moved.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00133b6nyr7xszd8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Every time I managed to meet the thing that I was aiming at, my brain said, ‘OK, this is now a thing that I can do, therefore it’s not good enough, and I need to do more,’” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00143b6ndkcllpvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It makes sense, because social media use is associated with muscle dissatisfaction and steroid use, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Boys’ bodies are on display more than ever on social media, especially through influencer accounts,” he added in an email. “Boys scroll through an endless feed of hyper-muscular, ultra-lean physiques, often heavily filtered or selected from hundreds of shots, which creates a constant pressure to measure up.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            When Mycock couldn’t reach the always far-off destination of the ultimate, masculine body, the message he received was that he just wasn’t good enough as a person, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00173b6nzt8v02yv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is a lot that researchers don’t know about muscle dysmorphia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00183b6n9ncj9z21@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Data on the prevalence is limited, but two studies in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33722325/#:~:text=A%20study%20of%203%2C618%20Australian%20adolescents%20found,to%20report:%20*%20Severe%20preoccupation%20with%20muscularity" target="_blank"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11916914/" target="_blank"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; estimate that 2% to 3% of boys meet the criteria for muscle dysmorphia, Ganson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00193b6ntago5bjq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One problem getting more information on the disorder is that people who have muscle dysmorphia likely have the gym and muscle building embedded in so much of their lives, that they are less likely to disrupt their world by seeking help, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001a3b6n7gbzregy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is also difficult to determine the best treatment, because the condition resembles body dysmorphic disorder and eating disorder behaviors. Dietary practices and bulking and cutting, for example, can veer into disordered eating, Ganson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001b3b6nmicjqk1h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness"&gt;Cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; would likely be the first line of defense, he said. But, family-based treatment like those used for adolescents with eating disorders might provide benefit as well, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001c3b6nnr6d0mzk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Either way, with the potential for physical and mental health consequences, people concerned that they may be experiencing muscle dysmorphia should seek professional help.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            A therapist or health care provider may be a good place to start.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001e3b6n5cya7av1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ideally, the support comes from an interdisciplinary team including mental health, medical and nutrition providers, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001f3b6net42mr23@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recovery from this condition isn’t linear.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001g3b6n44agtvyg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Today, Mycock can eat and exercise in a way that feels healthy and balanced, but body image is still something that takes some thought, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001h3b6nqm69mt7d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are still times that he feels insecure, but his work with a counselor has helped him to not make his feelings about his body the foundation of his whole life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001i3b6np0cagj9i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Previously, my life was built on a pillar, and the base of that pillar was the way that my body looked and the way people saw my body, and then everything else, like who I was, was built on top of that,” he said. “So, whenever something happened to that … my whole life fell apart.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001j3b6nkuuzrnpc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His counselor has helped him change his perspective so that his body is one brick on the pyramid of his life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001k3b6nrvazfs04@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I now also have that I like that I’m funny and I’m a good friend and I’m a good partner,” Mycock said, “On those days when my body isn’t what I want it to be, or I feel insecure about it, it doesn’t matter, because I’ve got all these other things that I like about myself.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of human history, around 50% of children used to die before they reached the end of puberty. In 2020, &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality"&gt;that number is 4.3%&lt;/a&gt;. It’s 0.3% in countries like Japan &amp;amp; Norway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dramatic decline has resulted from better nutrition, clean water, sanitation, neonatal healthcare, vaccinations, medicines, and reductions in poverty, conflicts, and famine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before ~1800, &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/parents-losing-their-child"&gt;almost every parent lost a child&lt;/a&gt;; now it’s such an uncommon experience that people have forgotten and want to ban vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

In a word—yikes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But let’s rewind for just a sec. That headline comes courtesy of a recent study out of Stanford Medicine, published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00692-2" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00692-2" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nature" data-vars-ga-product-id="108e64dd-ead9-4283-bc7f-1f14576d4ebd" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="1.1" data-href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00692-2" data-product-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00692-2" data-affiliate="false" data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-price="$0.00" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="7ba62241-2cfd-41f2-86fe-32c69cf61538" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-7bauu1 e1aq0z090"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="1.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="1.1.0.0"&gt;Nature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which examined the very, well, &lt;em data-node-id="1.3"&gt;nature&lt;/em&gt; of aging by studying participants’ molecules. (The study included 108 participants, both men and women, between the ages of 25 and 75.) What they found was that the molecules didn’t shift in numbers in a linear fashion over time, but in bursts around the ages of 44 and 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“It turns out the mid-40s is a time of dramatic change, as is the early 60s,” &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/08/massive-biomolecular-shifts-occur-in-our-40s-and-60s--stanford-m.html" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/08/massive-biomolecular-shifts-occur-in-our-40s-and-60s--stanford-m.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="2.1.0"&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; study senior author Michael Snyder, PhD, professor of genetics at Stanford University School of Medicine. “And that’s true no matter what class of molecules you look at.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Initially, researchers assumed that the mid-40s shift they noticed was due to the changes women in the test group were undergoing during &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/health/female-health/a45117939/is-testosterone-the-missing-piece-of-the-menopause-puzzle/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/health/female-health/a45117939/is-testosterone-the-missing-piece-of-the-menopause-puzzle/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="perimenopause or menopause" data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;perimenopause or menopause&lt;/a&gt;. But when they isolated just the men, the same shift was still evident, leading them to theorize that there are other underlying drivers of aging for both men and women that have nothing to do with perimenopause or menopause.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Further research will be needed to identify a lot of these whys—in addition to further validating the results. Given the study’s small participant pool and limited timespan (participants were followed for a median period of 1.7 years), a bigger, longer-term study will be needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But the initial results were undeniably compelling.

That nightly glass of Chardonnay. “As we age, we don't metabolize alcohol as easily, and it impairs our sleep quality,” says Keri Peterson, MD, an internal medicine physician, who begins discussing alcohol consumption more aggressively with patients in their 40s. “The metabolite of alcohol is a stimulant, so it wakes us up, often around 3 a.m.” (It’s worth noting that the Stanford study also found shifts in alcohol metabolism around ages 40 and 60.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If possible, Dr. Peterson recommends cutting alcohol out entirely. “Even with one glass, you're going to have disrupted sleep,” she says.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="establish-a-strength-training-routine-if-you-havent-already" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;3. Establish a strength-training routine (if you haven’t already).&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="21" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Women start losing muscle mass as early as their 30s. In fact, we lose about &lt;a href="https://womenshealth.gov/sarcopenia" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://womenshealth.gov/sarcopenia" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="3 to 5 percent per decade" data-node-id="22.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="22.1.0"&gt;3 to 5 percent per decade&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But you can preserve the muscle mass you have—or even build more!—by lifting, even just a few days a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“It doesn't have to be five days a week like a bodybuilder in a gym,” says Kristen McParland, a NASM-certified personal trainer. “There's tons of research that shows just two days a week of full-body strength training can give you a laundry list of positive side effects to your immune system, your muscle mass, your bone density, your mood, your sleep, and your heart health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Of course, you can’t lift the same 3-lb. dumbbell week after week in the hopes of seeing gains. “In order to see change in a muscular bone joint, you need to challenge the muscle,” McParland says. You can do this by incorporating &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a60720121/progressive-overload-training/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a60720121/progressive-overload-training/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="progressive overload" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="25.1.0"&gt;progressive overload&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into your routine, which essentially means upping the weight and/or reps every few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The Bottom line, says McParland: “If a client is in [the gym strength training] twice a week, they're lifting from 30 to 60 minutes full-body, and they're intentionally challenging their muscle groups—that's the most important part.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="support-your-muscles-with-protein" data-node-id="27" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;4.

While it’s a bit of a generalization, there’s certainly a nugget of truth to it, says McParland. “It doesn't matter how hard you work in the gym if you don't have an adequate protein and carbohydrate intake to help build the muscle.” While the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a60528607/how-much-protein-is-too-much/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a60528607/how-much-protein-is-too-much/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="recommended daily allowance (RDA) of protein has long been .36 grams per pound of body weight" data-node-id="29.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="29.1.0"&gt;recommended daily allowance (RDA) of protein has long been .36 grams per pound of body weight&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, McParland recommends aiming for .8 to 1 gram per pound of body weight to support muscle-building goals.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="dont-forget-the-cardio" data-node-id="30" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;5. Don’t forget the cardio.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="31" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The heart is a muscle, and it needs exercise too. (The Stanford study notes that aging has been associated with cardiovascular disease.)

That could take the form of incline walking, biking, hiking, or a light jog (emphasis on the light, McParland adds). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="protect-your-skin-with-spf" data-node-id="35" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;6.

That’s because UV rays cause &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/sun-and-uv/uv-radiation.html#:~:text=UVA%20rays%20are%20mainly%20linked,to%20cause%20most%20skin%20cancers." data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/sun-and-uv/uv-radiation.html#:~:text=UVA%20rays%20are%20mainly%20linked,to%20cause%20most%20skin%20cancers." data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="skin cells to age" data-node-id="37.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="37.1.0"&gt;skin cells to age&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and can harm the cells’ DNA. (Plus, there’s the increased risk of skin cancer.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;When shopping for a sunscreen, make sure it has an SPF of at least 30 (higher is even better) and that it’s marked as “broad spectrum,” meaning it provides coverage against both UVA and UVB rays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-node-id="39" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="as-you-approach-age-60" data-node-id="40" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="40.0"&gt;As You Approach Age 60...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="41" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you are already doing all of the above, here are a few more expert-backed action items to consider adding to your list in your later 40s and 50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="talk-to-your-doc-about-hormone-replacements" data-node-id="42" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;1.

This causes numerous side effects, including hot flashes, weight gain, sleep disturbances and more. You may be able to stave off some of these symptoms—and prevent some age-related conditions—by taking a hormone replacement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="45" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“I do recommend women discuss the pros and cons, whether they're a candidate, and whether they think it's for them with their doctor,” says Dr. Peterson. “If you're doing estrogen and progesterone without testosterone, it's going to help hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, osteoporosis prevention, and just overall sense of wellbeing. If you also do it with testosterone, that will help support muscle building and libido.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="implement-practices-that-help-keep-your-brain-stimulated-and-sharp" data-node-id="46" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;2.

If you’ve got a Bosu ball in your closet (or have one available at your local gym), Dr. Peterson suggests standing on top of the domed portion while doing upper body exercises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="consider-power-moves" data-node-id="55" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;4.

Predominantly, it seems to be a genetic condition, with studies showing that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4996332/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;60–90%&lt;/a&gt; of the risk is heritable. Having a close relative with autism is a significant risk factor for developing ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, many genes are involved in ASD risk. To date, more than &lt;a href="https://gene.sfari.org/database/gene-scoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;900 genes&lt;/a&gt; have been implicated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5377970/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;environmental factors&lt;/a&gt; play a part. These include being born to older parents, gestational diabetes and hypertension during pregnancy, and poor maternal mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have shown, however, that vaccines of any kind are not related to autism risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While animal research is a vital part of the scientific method, mouse models of ASD are fraught with challenges. Not least because many experts &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Wiley" rationale="Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gbb.12803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;believe that&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; “ASD is a uniquely human disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When interpreting the results of any animal study, we need to be extra skeptical. This is particularly the case when investigating neurodevelopmental conditions like ASD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the results of this study are encouraging, rodent models of ASD — although often created by altering genes that are known to be linked to ASD — are not a true representation of ASD in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; contacted &lt;a href="https://medicalcert.co.uk/about/drmariaknobel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Maria Knöbel&lt;/a&gt;, MBBS, Medical Director at MedicalCert, who was not involved in the research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Animal models provide a certain indication of the circuits and patterns of inflammation,” she explained, “but they cannot reflect human sensory or emotional life. A child who experiences sound at a greater intensity or an adult who has to plan his rest to prevent cognitive burnout traverses a sensory world that no rodent can know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings should be considered by the readers as early indicators that influence research and not as direct clinical instructions.”&lt;br&gt;— Maria Knöbel, MBBS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, experts believe that the traits associated with ASD are caused by problems that occur during development that impact brain cell signaling and the formation of synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the authors of the latest study focused on supplements that may support these functions, namely:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zinc: &lt;/strong&gt;A micronutrient that is important when forming synapses, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/137/1/137/360491?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;zinc deficiency&lt;/a&gt; has also been implicated in ASD-like behaviors in animal models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serine: &lt;/strong&gt;A common, non-essential amino acid, serine plays a role in metabolism and &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-020-00870-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;signaling between brain cells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Branch-chain amino acids (BCAA):&lt;/strong&gt; This group encompasses three essential amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Some of the genes associated with ASD control the &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Cell" rationale="Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(20)31146-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;transport or metabolism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; of BCAA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists decided to combine them into one supplement for two reasons. Firstly, using three in combination meant that they could use low doses of each, which reduces the risk of the negative effects of high doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, while all three are thought to support brain function, they all do so in different ways, creating an opportunity for synergism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test and investigate, the researchers gave the supplement to three different mouse models of ASD. They then measured changes in protein expression in the animals’ brains and neural activity in part of the &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Wiley" rationale="Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/brb3.2299" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;amygdala&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They chose the amygdala, specifically, because studies have shown that people with ASD have differences in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6546164/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;size&lt;/a&gt; or structure of their amygdalae, compared to neurotypical people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In two of the mouse models, the scientists also analyzed any changes in the animals’ social behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the scientists used BCAA, serine, or zinc supplements individually, they found no changes in the brains or behavior of the rodents. However, when given as a trio, they identified improvements in protein synthesis in the brain, synapse activity, and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors write: “Dietary supplements that enhance synaptic activity and protein synthesis can correct the abnormal neural activation and connectivity and improve the social behaviors of multiple ASD mouse models.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Co-first author, Ming-Hui Lin, was “thrilled to observe that just 7 days of treatment with the nutrient mixture significantly modulated neuronal circuit activity and connectivity in real time. These results provide strong support for the beneficial effects of low-dose nutrient supplement combinations.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As treatments for ASD are severely lacking, there may be a temptation to experiment on oneself or their child. However, this is not without risks. Speaking with &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;, Knöbel told us how she had seen people develop insomnia shortly after changing their supplement regimen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also told us how children, because of their smaller size, can easily be given “dangerous metabolic loads.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In agreement, clinical psychologist &lt;a href="https://www.davincified.com/authors/eleni-nicolaou" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Eleni Nicolaou&lt;/a&gt; warned &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that supplements at the wrong dose “can cause significant changes in sleep, heart rate, and the effects of medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have personally seen fatigue, nausea, and mood swings as a result of taking what appeared to be safe supplements,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, this study is a fascinating addition to our understanding of ASD. It may also be the first step along the road toward a simple treatment to ease symptoms for some people. However, much more work is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 20:45:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNRXlGZ0h2RzBaMHhrNTc2bkxhZWFiRVp0SzV0cGNZU3N1SEpoSThzZVpxem51bFRUaW81cTFGbC13c2trWEFiakJjVVNuaTRXTUNTbGJWNDdOTkRNbzZCeGhtZF9XcUtCYUhfa1lPbVR0YnpVSk1vUnV3ZFQ1dThCYjdGUFFydDA1TkdwVWFlaUdTcGc4VmQtRUJfRHdIbFRwVEZCZnlR</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，橙汁会影响免疫细胞中的数千个基因- Euronews.com</title><link>https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/12/02/orange-juice-found-to-affect-thousands-of-genes-in-immune-cells-study-says</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[6aW:mE÷aîjR€:Rşüù÷ßpıÿƒÑd¶Xmv‡Óåöx}~ÿ¯šU¹’è?®qõIô5*Î”ä·%µV¦{MÏ« ] ÀÀ*±ût6/²&amp;gt;ˆl´s/¿Í.�?j}ı¾Ó•dÇrMg+‰í¬gİÎ�ä

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;Giving a young kid a smartphone may be a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;New research conducted by scientists from UC Berkeley and Columbia University found that children 12 years old and younger who received one of these devices were at a higher risk of depression, obesity, and sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The alarming findings, published as a &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-072941/205716/Smartphone-Ownership-Age-of-Smartphone-Acquisition?" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;, were based on an analysis of over 10,000 children who participated in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study between 2018 and 2020, which is purportedly the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the US. And while they don’t strictly establish causation, the broad correlation they show underscores a larger and ever-growing body of research exploring the deleterious cognitive effects that devices like smartphones and tablets can have adolescents, ranging from their &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/future-society/banning-phones-schools-behavior"&gt;impact on their education&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/children-screen-time-developmental-delays"&gt;social skills&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“When you give your kid a phone, you need to think of it as something that is significant for the kid’s health — and behave accordingly,” lead author Ran Barzilay, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/01/well/family/early-smartphone-ownership-study.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In the study, about two-thirds of the participants used a smartphone. The median age they received them at was 11 years old, and their development was compared to a cohort of roughly 3,800 children in the study who never received a smartphone before turning 12.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Not only did the researchers find that children who owned a smartphone by age 12 were at a greater risk of depression, obesity, and poor sleep, but they also showed that the younger a child was when they first received a smartphone, the higher those risks became for obesity and poor sleep in particular. The earlier a kid is hooked on a smartphone, in other words, the worse their physical and mental health outcomes are likely to be.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Trying to identify the “right” age to give a youth a smartphone, however, may be missing the point. The researchers also found that a group of children who had never owned a smartphone before turning 12, but were then given one, showed a higher risk of poorer mental health and sleep by the time they were 13, compared to another group who stayed phoneless.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“We didn’t even look at what the kids did on the phone,” Barzilay &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/children-smartphones-increased-risk-of-health-problems-study/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CBS News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We basically asked one simple question: does the mere factor of having one’s own smartphone at this age range have anything to do with health outcomes?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;That is both a strength and a drawback to the study. It’s likely that it’s not just a quality inherent to the smartphones that are causing problems, but the apps they give access to, like social media sites, whose myriad risks to children are well documented. YouTube, TikTok, and streaming services like Netflix could supply an endless amount of entertainment to keep a child well up past their bedtime, too. Then there’s addictive mobile games designed to both murder your attention span and drain your wallet. At this moment, we’re also plunging headlong into a world of AI chatbots and companions, which &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/lonely-children-ai-chatbots"&gt;many children are turning to act as a close friend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;A lot of questions are unanswered, but these latest findings are echoed by a bevy of other research. A &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/study-younger-kids-smartphones"&gt;2025 study&lt;/a&gt; of over 100,000 children, for example, found that those who received smartphones before the age of 13 experienced more suicidal thoughts, a lower perception of self-worth, and detachment from reality. Similarly, the study also found that every year before 13 that a child received a smartphone was associated with a greater likelihood of poorer mental health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Society is still grappling with how these devices have transformed interpersonal relationships and taken over teenage and preteen attention spans. Many schools are opting to take the safe route by &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/future-society/banning-phones-schools-behavior"&gt;banning smartphones entirely&lt;/a&gt;. In follow-up research, Barzilay hopes to explore more specific features of smartphone usage to determine their link to mental health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“It’s critical for young people to have time away from their phones to engage in physical activity, which can protect against obesity and enhance mental health over time,” Barzilay said in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/childrens-hospital-of-philadelphia-study-links-smartphone-ownership-in-childhood-to-increased-risk-of-depression-and-obesity-in-youth-302627044.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about the work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on mental health:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/future-society/kids-test-scores-lowest-decades"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s an Interesting Theory About Why Kids’ Test Results Have Fallen to Their Lowest Point in Two Decades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They are anticipating to be open by the winter of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spot, formerly the ELDR Restaurant, also has ties to Biltmore, the release said. It was the site of Biltmore Industries — originally founded in Biltmore Village with support from Edith Vanderbilt — and was purchased in 1917 by Fred Loring Seely, son-in-law of Edwin Grove and the visionary behind the Grove Park Inn, the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Village Wayside owner Mark Harding said he and his wife are looking forward to starting business back up in the restaurant's new home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/hurricane-helene-journey-hope-return-biltmore-village-recovery-over-11-months-nearly-one-year-post-storm-tourism-visitors-locals-business-owners-association" target="_blank"&gt;HELENE: A JOURNEY OF HOPE (RETURN TO BILTMORE VILLAGE)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although we will forever cherish the memories of our time in Biltmore Village in the iconic old train depot, we are excited to embrace this new chapter as a chance to rebuild, grow, and connect with the community,” he said in the release. “We can’t wait to welcome back our loyal patrons of many years and introduce the Wayside to the North Asheville community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hardings operated Village Wayside in Biltmore Village for 15 years at the historic spot next to the depot, which itself represents a pivotal chapter in Asheville’s development. According to the release, when George Vanderbilt visited the region in 1888, he envisioned both a grand estate and a surrounding village. To bring this vision to life, he hired architect Richard Morris Hunt and landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. Their combined efforts shaped not only the Biltmore Estate but also the community that became Biltmore Village. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The train depot opened in 1896 and remained a transportation hub until 1975.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WLOS</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 19:02:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1wJBVV95cUxNV0xTMmlyTy13VlNLZXc2RTZReTc5c2FHaDlBcnZqd0xRNXVldU9DQ0tOY3ZoRDltWF91T3I5cG9Dc0FrbVctcEE1NXY1ZVNEYjkxV2p3Qk0xZ0V5eTBoeHk5bEpJbnRITmNMMnhIckxOay04TTRYRDNkVmR6ZTh3YVBNTU54azJMWndVVnliZEVMMEk0aHUwc2pPNnczV1JSTzlGckRIYVlnVTBrNmVWa0t3NVJPVGdhNlZob041M2dnWi1hU2RTemxhdmhxTVBnYlBMa3cxZWJ1MlRKVG0tVmRLX1J4ZzQ0Tk1QVnpHdDM2VlMtNlFoaThtdWRnOWViOXlrdW9VUElpTHdnaEpPYWtqemFsaWE3bW5ZSDVqRlUySFZVcU9Cd3JLN0RDS3RjalpsRWROZ3pEa0hfX2VmWjVOVkRRdmQ1OW9TXzVkb081bm9aRkRN</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.的疫苗顾问计划对儿童时间表进行最大的改变-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/12/02/acip-hepatitis-b-childhood-immunization-schedule/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DVZUM7HBPRCRXOG4SRIOIIZFGE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Federal vaccine advisers selected by Health Secretary Robert F.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This business philosophy helps ensure that consumers are getting high-quality products made with whole foods, such as brown rice, beans and vegetables, which &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/avery-zenker" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Avery Zenker, MAN, RD&lt;/a&gt;, says are crucial sources of essential nutrients, including fiber. “It's estimated that about 95% of Americans aren't meeting fiber recommendations. Fiber supports gut microbiome health, balanced blood sugar, stable appetite, immune health, healthy body weight and more,” she explained.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Whole foods and zero additives also translate to better flavor and quality. In other words, Amy’s canned soups are about as close to homemade quality as it gets.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://marraburroughs.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Marra Burroughs, DCN, RD&lt;/a&gt;, says that one thing she particularly appreciates about Amy’s products is their clear labeling, which she believes makes it easier for consumers to identify healthier options. Her favorites include the light in sodium versions of their split pea and lentil vegetable soups. “Canned soups are notoriously high in sodium, with some options containing 1,400 milligrams or more per serving. Choosing a reduced-sodium option can significantly decrease your sodium intake, supporting healthy blood pressure and kidney function, reducing the risk of heart disease and potentially decreasing fluid retention, since excess sodium causes the body to retain water,” explains Burroughs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

And she said that one of the simplest ways to stick to a balanced diet is to consume whole foods and prepare meals at home, or choose prepared foods that closely match those qualities. Nearly every Amy’s canned soup nutrition label features a variety of whole foods, making them among the best choices when trying to adhere to a healthy diet, such as the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-and-worst-diets-2025-8767671" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;DASH and Mediterranean diets&lt;/a&gt;, which focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. As for Greeley’s favorite go-to, she opts for the light in sodium chunky tomato bisque—it has 50% less sodium than the regular version.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Zenker adds that most Amy’s canned soups are free of cholesterol and low in sugar and saturated fats—ingredients that she says can increase the risk of chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Not all artificial ingredients and additives are linked to health risks, but they're not necessary for a healthy and tasty soup. Lack of artificial ingredients and fillers can help indicate whether a soup is high quality,” she noted.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Amy’s canned soups are widely available in most major supermarkets, as well as independent, natural and organic grocers. The brand also makes a large selection of prepared frozen foods, including frozen breakfast, lunch and dinner meals, as well as frozen snacks and vegetarian burger patties. Using the “Find Near You” tool on their website is the easiest way to locate stores near you that carry their products.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A diet rich in whole foods and low in sodium, added sugars and other additives is key to maintaining optimal nutrition, according to dietitians. Because prepackaged foods often contain less-than-optimal ingredients and disproportionately high levels of additives when compared to homemade foods, it can be difficult to find convenient options. Canned soups can make the task more effortless, as long as you’re choosing those prepared with nutritious, quality ingredients. Dietitians’ overall canned soup brand recommendation is Amy’s. They appreciate the brand’s focus on whole foods sourced from local organic farms, plus their low-sodium options that they say can lessen the risk of conditions such as high blood pressure and kidney disease. The line includes more than 30 varieties and is available at most major grocery retailers.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDC data has found that boys and young men, aged 12 to 24, have a heightened risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) after COVID-19 vaccination. However, the cases are rare, relatively mild, and almost always resolve, according to CDC data. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-06-25-26/04-Meyer-COVID-508.pdf"&gt;In a COVID-19 safety data presentation in June&lt;/a&gt;, CDC staff scientists reported that its vast vaccine safety monitoring systems indicated that in males 12–24, there are 27 myocarditis cases per million doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered (roughly one case in 37,000 doses). In cases identified during 2021, 83 percent recovered within three months, with more than 90 percent recovering within the year. The monitoring data found no instances of cardiac transplant or death from COVID-19 vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While anti-vaccine activists have seized on this minor risk from vaccination, health experts note that the risk of myocarditis and other inflammatory conditions from a COVID-19 infection is significantly greater than the risk from vaccination. Exact estimates vary, but &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7035e5.htm"&gt;one CDC study in 2021&lt;/a&gt; found that people with COVID-19 infections had a 16-fold higher risk of myocarditis than people without the infection. Specifically, the study estimated that there were 150 myocarditis cases among 100,000 COVID-19-infected patients versus just nine myocarditis cases among 100,000 people without COVID-19 infections and who were also unvaccinated. Similar to what’s seen with vaccination, the study found that young males were most at risk of myocarditis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kennedy’s allies attack on COVID-19 shots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and his allies, like Milhoan, have consistently inflated the risk of myocarditis from COVID-19 vaccination, with some claiming without evidence that they have caused sudden cardiac arrest and deaths in young males, though &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7314a5.htm"&gt;studies have found no such link&lt;/a&gt;. In 2022, Milhoan and fellow ACIP member and conspiracy theorist Robert Malone were featured in &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/SEVCD"&gt;a viral social media post&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that 50 percent of college athletes in the Big Ten athletic conference had myocarditis linked to COVID-19 vaccines, which could lead to deaths if they played. But the two were referencing a JAMA Cardiology study that examined subclinical myocarditis in Big Ten athletes &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2780548"&gt;after COVID-19 &lt;em&gt;infection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—not vaccination. In fact, researchers confirmed for &lt;a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.32HC88U"&gt;an AFP fact check&lt;/a&gt; that none of the athletes in the study were vaccinated. And the rate of subclinical myocarditis in the group was 2.3 percent, not 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

My wife and I have a decent sex life. But as in most marriages with children, my sex drive is quite higher than hers. I’d probably be good for two to three times a week where whereas she is good for about two to three times a month.&lt;/p&gt;

Even during the act (usually I spend anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes down there), I often have a reaction where I build up sinus pressure and can get a runny nose. It’s difficult to diagnose sinus infections, and the symptoms usually pass after two to three days, but this last one lasted over a week. Have you ever heard of anything like getting a head cold/flu/sinus infection from cunnilingus?&lt;/p&gt;

However, you want to track this (a list, a calendar app, or a paper planner) is fine, but you need to be meticulous, and you should log everything to the exact day and keep logging throughout the entire duration. Do this daily. Your memory, like everyone’s, is fallible, and if you’re trying to remember a week’s worth of stuff, you’re going to make mistakes. You might also see whether your wife is open to trying a dental dam, mostly to figure out whether that prevents the sinus symptoms, but there’s also a chance that she really enjoys the sensation and it works for her in a way that raw oral doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Contain High-Quality Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eggs are an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excellent source of amino acids&lt;/a&gt;, the building blocks of protein. One large hard-boiled egg provides 6 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, it’s not just about the amount of protein. Eggs boast one of the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7821729/myths-about-protein-fact-or-fiction/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;highest-quality forms of protein&lt;/a&gt;, which is readily available to your body to use for things like muscle-building and repair.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because eggs’ protein also promotes satiety, they may help with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2056824/16-weight-loss-tips-and-tricks-that-actually-work-according-to-dietitians/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight management&lt;/a&gt;. If weight loss is a goal, a hard-boiled egg can be a good snack, especially when paired with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044305/best-high-fiber-vegetables/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber-rich vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, says &lt;a href="https://kimberlygomer.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kimberly Gomer, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Provide Hard-to-Get Nutrients  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While egg whites are mostly protein, the yolks are the true nutritional gold mines. In addition to protein, the yolks contain nutrients many of us don’t get enough of, like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-d-than-an-egg-8732396" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamins D and E&lt;/a&gt;. Egg yolks are also one of the best sources of choline, which supports brain and nerve function, says &lt;a href="https://www.wowmd.com/pages/mia-syn?utm_source=google" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mia Syn, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Just one large egg provides 27% of the Daily Value for this underconsumed nutrient. Eggs also give you vitamin A, iodine and folate.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Have Eye-Healthy Antioxidants &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You know how the yolk is yellow? That’s a sign of its &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-protect-your-vision-8773401" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant pigments, lutein and zeaxanthin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Syn points out that these carotenoids may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-for-eye-health-according-to-a-dietitian-8773671" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;support eye health&lt;/a&gt;, as they accumulate in the retina, protecting the macula (the part of the eye responsible for sharp vision).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, research has found that people who ate two to four eggs weekly were 49% less likely to develop late-stage age-related macular degeneration (AMD) compared to those who ate one egg or less per week over the span of 15 years.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-perks-of-cottage-cheese"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Perks of Cottage Cheese &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Also Contains High-Quality Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With roughly &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/snack-recipes-10-grams-of-protein-11852613" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;12 grams of protein per half-cup&lt;/a&gt;, cottage cheese is an excellent source of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One particular protein you’ll find in cottage cheese is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-choose-the-best-cottage-cheese-11847051" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;casein protein&lt;/a&gt;, says Gomer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Casein digests slowly, and it can really help you feel full,” she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That doesn’t mean it’s better than eggs, though. In one older study that pitted cottage cheese versus eggs, researchers concluded that both foods had equal satiating power.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Also Rich in Vitamins and Minerals &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although cottage cheese contains a different set of vitamins and minerals than eggs, it still offers an impressive menu of micronutrients. “In addition to protein, it also provides key nutrients, including calcium and phosphorus, which are important for bone health, as well as B vitamins, which help convert the food we eat into energy,” says Syn.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Contain Probiotics &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Probiotics are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;live bacteria&lt;/a&gt; that promote the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;health of your gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some types of cottage cheese contain &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/16530/can-probiotics-really-help-your-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;added probiotics&lt;/a&gt;. To know for sure, check the ingredient list for live cultures, like &lt;em&gt;L. acidophilus&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium lactis&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-do-you-need-to-choose"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Do You Need to Choose? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nope. “Both are nutritious snack options on their own, but to make them more balanced, you can pair them with other foods,” says Syn. For example, a hard-boiled egg has protein and fat, so add a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/carbs-to-eat-every-week-11787950" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;source of carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;, like whole-grain toast or a piece of fruit, she recommends. For cottage cheese, top it with fruit like fresh berries. For an additional &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7993588/ways-to-add-healthy-fat-to-your-meals/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;source of healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;, add some nuts or seeds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding both to your weekly rotation is a great way to rack up a variety of nutrients. Plus, they’re super-convenient. Grocery and convenience stores may sell small cups of cottage cheese or packages of hard-boiled eggs. So, each can be a nice grab-and-go protein source when you’re out and about. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is one caveat: Your individual health concerns. If you are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290640/lactose-intolerance-symptoms-causes-what-to-eat-and-more/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sensitive to dairy&lt;/a&gt;, you may experience &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-reasons-youre-so-gassy-11755428" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;bloating or gas&lt;/a&gt; after eating dairy foods like cottage cheese, says Gomer. That’s because cottage cheese contains lactose, which some people are unable to digest fully. (However, it contains less lactose than milk.)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cottage cheese is also typically &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290568/looking-for-low-sodium-foods-watch-out-for-these-sneaky-sources-of-sodium/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high in sodium&lt;/a&gt;, with about 360 milligrams per half-cup. That can be an issue for you if you have high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fortunately, there are no-added-sodium versions you can buy with as little as 15 mg of sodium per half-cup.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; What about the cholesterol in eggs? It’s not a reason to avoid them. But if you have &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893923/habits-to-break-to-lower-cholesterol/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; or are genetically predisposed to high cholesterol, your health care provider may recommend limiting egg intake.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That said, the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8024093/best-low-fat-cheeses/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;saturated fat in full-fat cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt; can also raise blood cholesterol levels. So, if you’re on team cottage cheese and have high cholesterol, stick with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/283529/is-cottage-cheese-or-greek-yogurt-a-healthier-high-protein-snack/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;low-fat or fat-free cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Both hard-boiled eggs and cottage cheese are nutritious snacks that are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/snacks-more-protein-than-egg-11744826" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;packed with protein, vitamins and minerals&lt;/a&gt;. To make each of these foods even more nutritious, our registered dietitians recommend pairing them with fruits or vegetables for fiber and extra vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. If you have specific health concerns, such as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-cholesterol-cardiologist-recommendations-11780658" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high blood pressure or high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, your health care provider may recommend avoiding or limiting your intake of either full-fat cottage cheese or hard-boiled eggs. Otherwise, pick the one you like best—or, better yet, both of them!&lt;br&gt;
