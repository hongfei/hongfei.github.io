      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"When I was in my emergency medical services (EMS) class, my teacher brought in a death investigator and former autopsy examiner to speak to our class. She told us that while she worked as an autopsy examiner, she got this women who at the time mysteriously suffocated after a car accident. Apparently this women was driving, and while she was driving, she grabbed her lighter from her purse and was holding it in her mouth while she fumbled through her bag for her cigarettes. While doing this, she got T-boned. The airbag went off, and on the way to hospital, they kept trying to put tubes down her throat to open her airway, because she was having trouble breathing. But no luck. When they cut open her throat during the autopsy, they found her lighter jammed down there. Apparently when the airbag went off it got jammed down her throat and no one knew."&lt;/span&gt;

Pointed objects near the ears, neck, and chest just seem like welcoming signs inviting accidental death. Random? I know. But you can't unsee it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;–&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Wendy28J/" target="_blank"&gt;Wendy28J&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;MADISON, Wis. -- Two Wisconsin children died from respiratory illnesses, the Department of Health Services confirmed Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One child died from COVID-19 and the other died from influenza. They are the first children to die of a respiratory illness during the current respiratory virus season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a reminder about how serious these viruses can be, but it's not too late to protect yourself and your family by getting vaccinated," DHS Respiratory Disease Epidemiologist Tom Haupt said. "Respiratory vaccines are safe, effective, and the best tool we have to prevent doctor visits, hospitalization, and death for Wisconsinites."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can schedule a vaccine through your primary care provider, local health department, pharmacy or community clinic. The &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/immunization/vfc-parent.htm"&gt;Vaccines for Children program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/immunization/vfa.htm"&gt;Vaccines for Adults program&lt;/a&gt; have also been set up to help those without insurance cover the costs of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to take steps to stop the spread of germs during the times of year when respiratory viruses are more prevalent. The DHS recommends Wisconsinites:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wash hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid touching their nose, eyes, and mouth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay home and away from others if feeling sick.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid being around others who are sick or have flu symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing and encourage children to do the same.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear a high-quality mask around others to prevent the spread of respiratory illness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;​COPYRIGHT 2025 BY CHANNEL 3000.

A study has found that swearing can enhance physical performance by lowering inhibitions and pushing the brain into a “flow state”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In many situations, people hold themselves back – consciously or unconsciously – from using their full strength,” said Dr Richard Stephens, a psychologist at Keele University who led the research. “Swearing is an easily available way to help yourself feel focused, confident and less distracted, and go for it a little more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Previous research found that swearing could increase strength and pain tolerance in tests where participants repeated swearwords while pushing themselves to the limit, such as cycling at maximum effort or holding a hand in icy water. Researchers initially hypothesised that swearing triggered a “fight or flight” response but found no supporting evidence, such as an increased heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, the latest research suggests swearing triggers a state of disinhibition. “By swearing, we throw off social constraint and allow ourselves to push harder,” said Stephens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To test this, the researchers ran two experiments involving 192 people. In each, participants were asked to repeat either an expletive of their choice or a neutral word every two seconds while performing chair pushups. After completing the exercise, they answered questions about their mental state during the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Their answers suggested that swearing boosted self-confidence, improved psychological “flow” and distracted them from the task – important aspects of disinhibition. Confirming earlier findings, the researchers found that swearing increased the length of time people could maintain a chair pushup by 11%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“These findings help explain why swearing is so commonplace,” said Stephens. “Swearing is literally a calorie-neutral, drug-free, low-cost, readily available tool at our disposal for when we need a boost in performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stephens said the power of swearwords was likely to lie in their taboo nature. His team is investigating whether more offensive language produces greater physical gains, in a “dose-response” trial that will test how long participants can tolerate holding their hand in icy water while repeating either mild or strong swearwords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The team is also exploring whether the confidence boost associated with swearing could help in other contexts, such as public speaking or making a romantic approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There are lots of situations where hesitancy might be to our detriment,” said Stephens. “You could go into a quiet room, go for it swearing for a minute and then go out and give your talk. I bet people do it already.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, he cautioned that swearing was not an entirely risk-free strategy. “You’re never quite sure when you use a swearword how it’s going to land,” he said. “You have to know your audience and who is around. You could land yourself in hot water if you swear inappropriately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The findings are published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-amp0001650.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;American Psychologist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOZExSNzdzVlFTZWNvLUN1enRoUzJHc3ZUNTgycGZCdW1qdWhwTVl0Ql9ZTzVYcWZBZ1lubndqWWR6amRDMTVQNEJTMjA4ZXlxT3ZxUkUya0preERwdUxSTy1FU19qUmJ1MGY2TEt2blJtenMyN1g3NWJGeUNwWl9jbHFwdUljXzBSVkgxaDhzdjNBUzRaUHhGaVhWc2RlWHhCV0ZzUHhHakQ</guid></item><item><title>避免在飞机上生病的最佳座位-福克斯新闻</title><link>https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/best-seat-avoid-getting-sick-plane</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fox News</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 13:18:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE5fdUZhTWJPdVFPY3IwdVZHbW1jZUVyMnFKejlFcTlFTXR0enVuaGprREhyUko4aVByZWlzRE90ekdIRi16VTVoWXdoVVYwOXdxMnRDRXFFS3FIbFpYSi01SG5iYThMLTE0TG5VNHc0ZVVDTVdqWWxz</guid></item><item><title>为什么女性要支付超过2000 $来逆转“Ozempic阴道” ，因为它变得越来越普遍- UNILAD</title><link>https://www.unilad.com/news/health/ozempic-vagina-explained-labia-puffing-380308-20251217</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p class="loading-bar_loader__2fNms"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;main class="article_main__eth__ "&gt;&lt;template id="B:0"&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;p class="article-page-skeleton_background__h2J4n"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;&lt;p hidden id="S:0"&gt;&lt;template id="P:1"&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</description><author>UNILAD</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 13:18:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxPZGVuVzZ1N1BOYlZBRUl3LUxfa0g2SHBJMnpydXBJV2NPSG40MUZMYkp5UmJWWjJxWXlpZUpLVGlwb1JHTkY0SDVJRWFRQjdNVDFZV3JXLU5vT3M5eWYxOEdqdXRRWWthWXRYMGNRUFc0YUtvWlZwQ3FWYU84dGRxakN5WjdZdjg2VG9mazIxUWpHMnc</guid></item><item><title>哪些血液测试可以检测出阿尔茨海默氏症的生物标志物，哪些不能告诉您-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/12/18/alzheimers-detection-blood-tests/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SABCJW3FRFH7ROGV42QTW5UAXI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As scientists race to develop simple blood tests that could one day act as an early warning system for Alzheimer’s disease by sounding the alarm before memory problems appear, new research shows tracking shifts in certain protein biomarkers over time is more accurate than relying on a single test result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 13:01:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxOZEVYaXBwenMtT0h0cWJPcFZwNTQ0emJERF95R2JJZU1rNnBEcndteExJOGZESDEwSGRGMnZTWFhlRWhnNzRKbWZER2tlclVvQTVROXc4MGtjTWZYbXJnSmNzOXpxQmFCWDhyRnJabmJwclVpTlJhX0ItMlVQcXI0aGtIMW5DbTdUZWc</guid></item><item><title>流感疫情：您所在地区的医院如何受到影响？ - BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgqkvll1yvo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Hospitals across the UK are seeing high levels of flu cases this winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The NHS in England has said it is on "on high alert" after seeing the highest ever number of flu cases in hospital for this time of year, in the week ending 14 December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;You can use our tool below to find out how many flu patients there are in hospitals near you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Figures relating to flu cases in hospitals are collected in different ways in each UK nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In England it is the weekly number of beds occupied by patients with a laboratory confirmed flu case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This data is provided at NHS Trust level.

			&lt;p&gt;One of the finest foods available to humanity may carry an unexpected benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study has found that eating 50 grams (1.76 ounces) or more of high-fat cheese a day correlates with a lower risk of developing dementia. That means all cheeses with more than 20 percent fat content, &lt;a href="https://bcpa.eu/factsheets/FatContentOfCheeses.htm"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; brie, gouda, cheddar, parmesan, gruyere, and mozzarella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extensive, long-term study followed 27,670 adults in Sweden for around 25 years. The findings establish an association between daily consumption of high-fat cheese and lower dementia risk that is statistically detectable – although more research needs to be done to figure out the potential mechanism behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-sleeping-pill-could-reduce-buildup-of-alzheimers-proteins-study-finds"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Common Sleeping Pill Could Reduce Buildup of Alzheimer's Proteins, Study Finds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For decades, the debate over high-fat versus low-fat diets has shaped health advice, sometimes even categorizing cheese as an unhealthy food to limit," &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/home/PressRelease/5304"&gt;says nutrition epidemiologist Emily Sonestedt&lt;/a&gt; of Lund University in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study found that some high-fat dairy products may actually lower the risk of dementia, challenging some long-held assumptions about fat and brain health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is an umbrella term for &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia/types-of-dementia"&gt;several conditions&lt;/a&gt; that impair cognitive function, such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="186017" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease (the most common form), vascular dementia, and dementia that can develop in disorders like &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia/types-of-dementia/parkinson-s-disease-dementia"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt;57 million people&lt;/a&gt; were living with dementia in 2021, and an estimated 10 million new cases are diagnosed every year. A 2019 Global Burden of Disease analysis projected that, by 2050, the number of cases could rise &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s2468-2667(21)00249-8"&gt;as high as 153 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since there's a dearth of effective treatments for dementia, some researchers are focusing their efforts on ways of reducing the chances of developing dementia, with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-study-links-4-healthy-diets-with-up-to-28-lower-dementia-risk"&gt;diet playing a major role&lt;/a&gt; in these &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-diet-helps-lower-dementia-risk-and-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;risk mitigation strategies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The so-called MIND diet – a variation of the Mediterranean diet – has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sticking-to-the-mind-diet-could-reduce-your-risk-of-developing-dementia"&gt;been touted as promising&lt;/a&gt;; however, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13195-022-00957-1"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2023.0800"&gt;different studies&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15010032"&gt;inconsistent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dairy is one particular food group whose association with dementia has been difficult to establish. Studies from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-022-02834-x"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-022-00615-2"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-taste-for-cheese-may-reveal-your-future-risk-of-dementia"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, for example, have looked at different amounts of cheese consumption and found varying results in dementia links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new paper, led by nutrition epidemiologist Yufeng Du of Lund University, researchers set out to clarify these inconsistent findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They based their analysis on the &lt;a href="https://www.malmo-kohorter.lu.se/malmo-diet-cancer-mdc"&gt;Malmö Diet and Cancer cohort&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;a long-running observational study surveying Swedish residents about their diet and tracking health outcomes&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span&gt;Of the 27,670 participants, 3,208 developed dementia over the course of about 25 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants recorded their diet at baseline using a 7-day food diary, a food-frequency questionnaire, and a detailed interview about food preparation and eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="docos-replyview-body docos-anchoredreplyview-body docos-replyview-body-emoji-reactable docos-replyview-body-emoji-reactable-background" dir="ltr"&gt;The researchers compared people's dementia risk based on their cheese intake. Around 10 percent of those who ate 50 grams or more of high-fat cheese per day developed dementia, compared to about 13 percent of people who ate less than 15 grams a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, sex, education, and overall diet, people who ate more than 50 grams of high-fat cheese per day had a 13 percent lower all-cause dementia risk compared to people who ate less than 15 grams per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No such association appeared for low-fat cheese or cream, any kind of milk, or fermented milk products such as yogurt and kefir. Butter showed mixed results, including a possible increased Alzheimer's risk at high intake compared to people eating no butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before you chow down on cheese with abandon, other researchers point out important issues with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"One of the biggest limitations of this study is the cheese consumption as recorded from a food diary and interview at one time point 25 years before the analysis of dementia diagnosis. It is highly likely that diet and other lifestyle factors changed in those 25 years," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-looking-at-the-association-between-eating-high-fat-cheese-and-cream-and-dementia-risk/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Tara Spires-Jones, Division Lead in the UK Dementia Research Institute, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As nice as it would be, it may not be wise to pin your hopes on any one food to protect yourself against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214343"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Neurology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The time to get vaccinated for this season is now,” Timothy Uyeki, the chief medical officer of the influenza division at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said in a call with clinicians last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The message comes amid diminishing access to and flourishing rumors about vaccines under Robert F Kennedy Jr, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, who has made &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/health/rfk-jr-vaccines-autism-video.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;false claims&lt;/a&gt; about the ineffectiveness of flu vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/06/vaccine-panel-hepatitis-b-change" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;overseen limitations&lt;/a&gt; on routine vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After a year of dramatic cuts to staff and programs at health agencies, CDC officials highlighted the need to continue monitoring variants such as the H3N2 virus subclade K – currently the top strain in the US – as flu season unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s hard to say what will happen throughout the season, and that’s why we need surveillance to really track this,” Uyeki said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A child died of the flu in the week ending 22 November, marking the first known pediatric death this season, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-49.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC also reported another child death from flu during last year’s season, bringing the total to 288 – the deadliest pediatric flu season on record outside of a pandemic. Last year, there were an estimated 610,000 to 1.3 million hospitalizations from influenza in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Last season, by all indicators, was a high severity season and one of the highest we have experienced in the US,” Uyeki said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Officials at the CDC on last week’s call highlighted changes in vaccine policy – including a new recommendation against thimerosal, a preservative also known as thiomersal, previously used in a small percentage of flu vaccines. The CDC’s vaccine advisers voted to recommend only flu vaccines without the preservative in a June meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The top regulators of vaccines and drugs at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also recently announced changes to how flu vaccines will be approved, which may include &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/fda-vaccine-regulations-unconfirmed-covid-deaths" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;extensive trials&lt;/a&gt; each year for children and pregnant people that would put annual vaccination &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/04/us-vaccines-vinay-prasad-memo" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;out of reach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Children, pregnant people, immune-compromised people, and the elderly are among those at highest risk of illness and death. Vaccines protect against severe complications like pneumonia, cardiac complications, neurological issues, and encephalopathy, or brain dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There were 109 cases of encephalopathy among children last year, with 74% needing intensive care and 54% needing mechanical ventilators. Most (55%) of the children with encephalopathy had no underlying conditions – except for not being vaccinated. Only 16% of the children who were eligible had gotten vaccinated. Nearly one in five (19%) of the children with encephalopathy died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The majority of these are preventable, and this is really, really tragic,” said Uyeki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is the highest number of deaths for a seasonal influenza epidemic since we’ve been keeping track, and clearly highlights the fact that we need to do a much better job of preventing influenza and preventing influenza-associated death in children in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last year, the vaccine was 63% to 78% &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing hospitalization among children and 41% to 55% effective against hospitalization among adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In August, the CDC identified the new variant (H3N2 virus subclade K), which mutated from the version of H3N2 included in the vaccine – raising concerns that the flu vaccine might be less effective this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;index&amp;quot;:16,&amp;quot;listId&amp;quot;:4152,&amp;quot;identityName&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;today-us&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Headlines US&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;frequency&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Every day&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;We'll send you The Guardian Headlines US every day&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;news&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idApiUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As the flu season in the US is only beginning now, there is too little data so far to calculate how effective the vaccine is against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s too early to know what impact exactly this new subclade will have on the influenza vaccine effectiveness for this season,” said Lisa Grohskopf, also a medical officer in the CDC’s influenza division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It takes a little while before accumulating enough activity and specimens to be able to calculate [vaccine effectiveness].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Based on early numbers from the United Kingdom, which had an early start to the flu season, vaccine effectiveness is about 70 to 75% for children and 30 to 40% for adults – similar to prior vaccine efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The evidence indicates that “influenza vaccination remains an effective tool in preventing influenza-associated hospitalizations for the season”, Grohskopf said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The flu vaccine is recommended for everyone six months and up, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Providers have been &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/11/pediatricians-vaccines-flu-season" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommending FluMist more&lt;/a&gt; to patients who are eligible. It’s not a shot, which may assuage vaccine hesitancy. And it may now be given at home by a caregiver or the patient after a major change from the FDA in September 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;​​Antivirals are also a safe and effective way to treat and prevent severe illness, including in pregnancy, and they work best the sooner they can be started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In recent years, flu antiviral prescriptions have dropped, Uyeki said. Only 35% of children at high risk are prescribed antivirals, and only 32% of children who visited emergency departments because of flu were prescribed antivirals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 12:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5XYjFjM1J0WUxCVWZZcXI3d05pbGRXVzZIUU1wakNYd3pzOWNrNVBoaFFXLWZLdkRXdk9FUjJudG4tMXJ4cHJEQTNDY1VlM3JUbnVsVkdUQm9RVERzak9Hc2Q2TzZKUzJIOUFHVV9mWjJkWl91NkE</guid></item><item><title>尝试治疗喉咙痛的7种家庭疗法-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/12/18/sore-throat-home-remedies/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N52IDJ4S7RDVJOHY2YI3DAAQGU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Woke up to a sore, scratchy throat?

In this study though, the researchers identified six specific symptoms that may act as warning flags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings show that dementia risk is linked to a handful of depressive symptoms rather than depression as a whole," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/dec/specific-depressive-symptoms-midlife-linked-increased-dementia-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiological psychologist Philipp Frank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This symptom-level approach gives us a much clearer picture of who may be more vulnerable decades before dementia develops."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/laughing-gas-can-offer-immediate-relief-from-depression-study-finds"&gt;Laughing Gas Can Offer Immediate Relief From Depression, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data for 5,811 individuals taking part in a longitudinal study in the UK. Information on patients' mental health was collected between 1997 and 1999, when the participants were aged between 45 and 69 and all dementia free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health of these volunteers was then tracked for around two decades afterwards, on average. Dementia diagnoses &lt;span&gt;recorded in UK health records and registries &lt;/span&gt;up to 2023 were used in the final results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over that time, 10.1 percent of the participants developed dementia – and those who reported five or more symptoms of depression in middle age were found to have a 27 percent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-roots-of-dementia-trace-back-all-the-way-to-childhood-experts-find"&gt;higher risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this risk increase was driven by six specific depressive symptoms, out of 30 assessed in total. Those six were losing confidence, difficulty coping with problems, not feeling affection for others, being &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-trial-compares-yoga-and-therapy-as-a-treatment-for-anxiety"&gt;nervous all the time&lt;/a&gt;, having difficulty &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/switching-off-for-a-moment-lets-your-brain-do-something-wonderful"&gt;concentrating&lt;/a&gt;, and not being satisfied with the way tasks are carried out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_185951" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-185951" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/DepressionChart.jpg" alt="Depression chart" class="wp-image-185951 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/DepressionChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/DepressionChart-600x571.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-185951" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers linked six symptoms of depression with dementia risk.

Some symptoms, such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/poor-sleep-can-trigger-a-vicious-cycle-your-brain-cant-break-experts-warn"&gt;sleep problems&lt;/a&gt; and suicidal ideation, showed no long-term correlation with dementia diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the structure of the study doesn't show direct cause and effect, it suggests that certain elements of depression are associated with a higher chance of developing dementia – which may in turn inform research into &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-study-links-15-factors-to-early-dementia-risk"&gt;why dementia takes hold&lt;/a&gt; of some brains but not others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyday symptoms that many people experience in midlife appear to carry important information about long-term brain health," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/dec/specific-depressive-symptoms-midlife-linked-increased-dementia-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Frank.

The team acknowledges that the research was conducted only in the UK, using relatively healthy civil servants. Dementia was found to be less common in participants in the longitudinal study, compared to the general UK population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed in more diverse cohorts, especially with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(21)00249-8"&gt;dementia expected&lt;/a&gt; to become more prevalent as the growing global population gets older. But it could give scientists a place to start at least, and if a proportion of those cases can be prevented, it could make a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Depression doesn't have a single shape – symptoms vary widely and often overlap with anxiety," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/dec/specific-depressive-symptoms-midlife-linked-increased-dementia-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Mika Kivimäki.

    &lt;p&gt;Is it possible to spot personality dysfunction from someone’s everyday word use?  My colleagues and I have conducted research that suggests you can, and often sooner than you might expect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether in a quick text message, a long email, a casual chat with a friend, or a comment online, the words people choose quietly reveal deeper patterns in how they think, feel, and relate to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has personality traits – habitual ways of thinking, feeling and behaving. When these patterns become rigid, intense or disruptive, they can cause ongoing problems with emotions, sense of self and relationships. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the more severe end are personality disorders, where these patterns create significant distress and impairment. Common &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/people-with-personality-disorders-are-more-likely-to-sign-up-for-psychology-studies-heres-why-thats-a-problem-201237"&gt;personality disorders&lt;/a&gt; include narcissistic, antisocial, and borderline personality disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not everybody has a full-blown disorder. Personality functioning actually exists on a spectrum. &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-are-we-becoming-so-narcissistic-heres-the-science-55773"&gt;We’re all a little narcissistic&lt;/a&gt;, after all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people you meet – at work, when dating, or online – may show milder difficulties, such as mood fluctuations, negativity, rigid thinking or darker traits like manipulation and callousness. These patterns often &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145041"&gt;slip into how people speak&lt;/a&gt; or write long before they show up in more explicit behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some extreme examples. Linguists &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/forensicsci3010006"&gt;analysing the personal letters of Austrian serial killer Jack Unterweger&lt;/a&gt; – widely viewed as a classic case of malignant narcissism – found unusually high levels of self-focused language, such as “I” and “me”. He also had a notably flat emotional tone. Likewise, letters from Dennis Rader, the BTK killer (bind, torture, kill) displayed strikingly &lt;a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/C/bo44312033.html"&gt;grandiose, detached and dominance-focused wording.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychologists have long known that certain linguistic habits reveal how people are functioning internally. For example, people experiencing distress consistently use more &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2017.02.005"&gt;self-focused language&lt;/a&gt; and more &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2018.05.035"&gt;negative emotion words&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because they internalise a lot and experience negative affect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those with darker personality traits often use more &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2983323.2983822"&gt;hostile, negative and disconnected language&lt;/a&gt;, including more swear words and anger words, such as “hate” or “mad”. At the same time, they use fewer socially connected terms like “we”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitally, these patterns aren’t usually deliberate. They emerge naturally because &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0261927X09351676"&gt;language tracks attention, emotion and thought&lt;/a&gt;. With computational text analysis, researchers can now analyse these subtle cues at scale, and rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our research findings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across four studies using computational text analysis – three of which formed my &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.17635/lancaster/thesis/2215"&gt;PhD research&lt;/a&gt; – my colleagues and I found clear evidence that personality dysfunction leaves a detectable trace in everyday communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one study of 530 people, published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1521/pedi.2023.37.4.444"&gt;Journal of Personality Disorders&lt;/a&gt;, we analysed written essays about peoples’ close relationships. We also collected data on their levels of personality dysfunction. Those with greater personality dysfunction used language that carried a sense of urgency and self-focus – “I need…”, “I have to…”, “I am…”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was expressed alongside ruminative, past-tense wording. They also had more negative, particularly angry, emotion terms, such as “furious” and “annoyed”. At the same time, they used noticeably less intimate or affiliative language such as “we”, “love” and “family”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a second project, published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2023.100647"&gt;Journal of Affective Disorders Reports&lt;/a&gt;, we again analysed written essays (530 people), as well as transcribed conversations from 64 romantic couples which included women with diagnosed personality disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across both written and spoken communication, those with more dysfunctional or disordered personalities used more negative emotion words – and a wider variety of them. Even during mundane conversations, their language carried heavier negative affect, indicating a preoccupation with negative feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning to online communication, in a study recently published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44184-025-00142-w"&gt;npj Mental Health Research&lt;/a&gt;, we analysed nearly 67,000 Reddit posts from 992 people who self-identified as having a personality disorder. Those who frequently engaged in self-harm used language that was markedly more negative and constricted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their posts contained more self-focused language and more negations – such as “can’t”. They also used more sadness and anger terms, and more swearing, while referencing other people less. Their wording was also more absolutist, reflecting all-or-nothing thinking, favouring words like “always”, “never”, or “completely”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/707834/original/file-20251210-64-6jtq4l.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Look out for anger and swearing.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/angry-furious-businesswoman-working-on-computer-325331660?trackingId=%7B%22app%22%3A%7B%22module%22%3A%22image-search-results%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22next-web%22%2C%22page%22%3A%22ecomm%22%7D%2C%22providers%22%3A%5B%7B%7D%5D%2C%22svc%22%3A%22recommendation-api%22%2C%22strategy%22%3A%7B%22name%22%3A%22INTENT%22%2C%22version%22%3A%221.0%22%7D%2C%22uuid%22%3A%22571603c8-1ddf-405c-aa49-422d54d50e20%22%7D"&gt;pathdoc/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, these features created a linguistic picture of emotional overwhelm, negativity, withdrawal and rigid thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in an ongoing project analysing more than 830,000 posts from the same 992 individuals with personality disorder, plus 1.3 million posts from a general-population comparison group of 945 people, we examined how people express their self-beliefs (“I am …”, “I feel …”, “My …”). Using an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-long.69"&gt;advanced self-belief classification tool&lt;/a&gt;, we found that people with personality disorders shared self-beliefs on online discussion forums far more often, and their wording differed profoundly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their self-beliefs were more negative, extreme, and disorder-focused, including phrases like “my mental health”, “symptoms”, “diagnosis” and “medication”. They also used more emotional descriptors such as “depressive”, “suicidal” and “panic”. Many self-belief statements centred on pain and trauma – “abusive”, “abandonment”, “hurt”, “suffer”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also frequently referenced childhood or significant relationships (“mother”, “partner”, “relationship”). These patterns arose across a wide range of discussion contexts, suggesting that deeper struggles with identity may surface in language universally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why this matters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding these linguistic patterns isn’t about diagnosing people from their texts. It is about noticing shifts in language that can provide gentle clues. If someone’s messages suddenly become unusually urgent or extreme, emotionally negative, absolutist, inward-focused and socially detached, it may be a sign they’re struggling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in everyday situations – dating, befriending, online interactions – recognising patterns of hostility, extreme negativity, and emotional and cognitive rigidity can help people spot early red flags. This is particularly for dark personality styles, such as psychopathy or narcissism. For instance, noticeably high use of self-references (“I”, “me”), anger words (“hate”, “angry”), and swear words, combined with a lack of terminology indicative of social connection (“we”, “us”, “our”), may be important language patterns to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no single word or phrase reveals someone’s personality. People vent, joke, and use sarcasm. What really matters is the pattern over time; the emotional tone, themes and recurring linguistic habits. Subtle linguistic traces can offer a window into someone’s emotional world, identity, thinking patterns and relationships long before they speak openly about their difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noticing these patterns can help us learn about and understand others, support those who may be struggling, and navigate our social lives safely – online and offline – with greater awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent outbreak of gastrointestinal illness at a South Jersey school has public health experts urging people to take precautions this winter and ahead of the holidays to avoid additional infections.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Camden County officials did not confirm the name of the school, but the outbreak is taking place at Central Elementary School in Haddonfield, according to a CBS &lt;a href="https://central.haddonfieldschools.org/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact number of affected students is unknown, but county officials say the school has reported an “unusual increase” in children with nausea, vomiting and other symptoms since Dec. 10.
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The scope of the outbreak grew Friday when the school reported an uptick in illnesses to the county’s Department of Health and Human Services.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gastrointestinal illnesses can be highly contagious, so it is essential that families are aware of the signs and symptoms,” Virginia Betteridge, the department’s commissioner liaison, said in a statement.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/7040-gastrointestinal-diseases"&gt;gastrointestinal illness&lt;/a&gt; can also include diarrhea, stomach cramps, fever and fatigue. While most people can manage it and recover at home, others including young children, seniors and those with weakened immune symptoms are at risk of dehydration and other complications.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gastrointestinal illnesses are typically caused by bacteria, parasites or viruses like &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17703-norovirus"&gt;norovirus&lt;/a&gt;, which can survive on high-touch surfaces like doorhandles, keyboards, phones and countertops for days or &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-long-do-norovirus-germs-live-on-household-and-office-surfaces"&gt;even weeks&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The risk of outbreaks in the winter and during holidays&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cases and outbreaks are more common in the winter as people spend more time indoors and in settings like schools, long-term care facilities and daycares, said Caryelle Lasher, director of the county’s Department of Health and Human Services.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infections caused by norovirus usually spread when people come into contact with fecal matter and then ingest microscopic particles on their hands, on cups or utensils, or in food.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And that can happen from people not washing their hands well or it can be spread through things contaminated by vomit,” she said. “That’s where we see these really quick spreading, intense outbreaks because it takes so little to make people sick.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schools are especially susceptible for outbreaks, Lasher said, “with young children who may not know to do a really thorough frequent hand washing after the use of the bathroom or before eating or preparing food.”
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Health experts assert that true detoxification is not about gimmicks or extreme cleanses, it is about lifestyle habits that support the body’s innate cleansing systems, particularly the liver and gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While pop health culture oversimplifies detox, decades of medical research show that specific lifestyle factors like diet composition, physical activity, microbiome balance, control of metabolic disease and personalised genomic insights play crucial roles in maintaining healthy liver and gut function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Five Effective Ways to Detoxify Your Gut Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with the Times of India, Dr Sajeev Nair, Founder and Chairman of Vieroots, shared, “Detox and detox diets have become widely misused terms in pop health circles. In this context, it would be enlightening to look at how real detox with regard to liver and gut, that are research-validated, like elimination of ‘toxins’ and adoption of healthy lifestyles through genomic lifestyle management, can help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are 5 such most important means to pursue real detox of these vital organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dietary detox: Reining in harmful exposures&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While food is not a “toxin” in the strict chemical sense, diet can act as a major source of metabolic stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excess sugars, refined carbohydrates and saturated fats, as well as alcohol, challenge liver function and disrupt gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Nair warned, “The primary ‘toxic’ substances for your gut and liver are macronutrients like carbs and fats that are taken in excess. The only exception here is alcohol, which is toxic by its very nature. Among excessive carbs and fats, two require special mention - sugars and foods that raise triglycerides like meat, butter, fries, refined carbs etc. These raise the risks for liver diseases like fatty liver and gut issues like dysbiosis and pancreatitis. Avoiding such foods is the most essential gut and liver detox.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Sugary beverages, processed meats and refined grains are all common in modern Western eating patterns and exacerbate fat deposition and inflammation in the liver. Avoiding these foods is not a fad, it is metabolic self-defence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fitness detox: Moving beyond the gym session&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is not just about building muscle or hitting a step count. Physical activity, particularly habitual movement throughout the day, reduces metabolic stress on both the gut and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Nair suggested, “Next only to dietary factors, the most essential gut and liver detox is physical fitness. By this I don’t just mean once-daily exercise sessions, muscle building or metrics like VO2 Max but following an active lifestyle throughout your waking hours. This is because a sedentary lifestyle is toxic to the gut, causing issues like slower digestion, constipation, bloating, gas, IBS, ulcers etc. and to the liver, by causing non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cirrhosis, metabolic dysfunction etc.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30809066/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2019 meta-analysis in Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; reviewed multiple cohorts and found that regular physical activity, even modest increases in daily movement, was associated with lower odds of NAFLD, independent of weight loss. The authors noted, “Greater physical activity was significantly associated with reduced odds of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, regardless of body mass index.” Movement stimulates blood flow, enhances insulin sensitivity and reduces visceral fat, which are key drivers of both liver and gut dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Microbiome detox: Balancing gut bacteria for systemic benefits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome or the trillions of bacteria living in your digestive tract plays a central role in digestion, immune modulation and even the “gut-liver axis”, a two-way communication network between gut microbes and liver cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Nair said, “Many of you might have heard about the gut microbiome - the beneficial, benign and harmful mix of microbes in our gut and how it contributes to not only gut health but overall health including psychological health. Prebiotics and probiotics optimise the microbiome and its metabolites like SCFAs, helping the liver through the Gut Liver Axis, protecting against common liver diseases like alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver and by helping in liver repair and regeneration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

They established, “Microbiota-derived metabolites have profound effects on host metabolic pathways, immune function, and liver homeostasis, implicating gut dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of liver disease.” Prebiotics (fibre that feeds good bacteria) and probiotics (beneficial bacterial strains) can help restore balance and promote metabolites that protect both gut and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Disease detox: Addressing the underlying drivers &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gut and liver dysfunction rarely occur in isolation. Conditions like obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and metabolic syndrome all share common inflammatory and metabolic roots with liver and gut disease. Controlling these conditions is a form of real detox by reducing systemic stressors that otherwise overwhelm the body’s organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Nair said, “This is one of the most commonly overlooked detoxes required by both your gut and your liver. Common gut and liver issues don’t occur in isolation but are often found along with lifestyle diseases like diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, metabolic syndrome etc. Examples are diabetes linked fatty liver, gastroparesis, acid reflux, constipation, diarrhoea etc. Hence, it is essential to ideally prevent or at least control such lifestyle diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4812181/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2016 comprehensive review in World Journal of Gastroenterology &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;confirmed that features of metabolic syndrome including high blood sugar, increased waist circumference and abnormal lipid profiles are consistently linked with fatty liver and gut impairment. The study found, “Metabolic syndrome significantly increases the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and related complications.” Effective management of blood glucose, lipids and weight is therefore a cornerstone of preventing liver and gut diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Genomic lifestyle detox: Personalised risk management&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging research reveals that genetic predisposition plays a meaningful role in many gut and liver disorders. For instance, conditions like Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and NAFLD have heritable components, meaning why one person gets sick and another doesn’t may partly stem from genetic susceptibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

An even deeper and significant ‘toxin’ is your genetic susceptibility for developing gut and liver issues. For instance a common gut issue like IBS and a common liver issue like NAFLD both have nearly 60% genetic components. A genomic lifestyle management solution like Eplimo can detect risks for these gut and liver issues years or decades before they actually develop and help prevent them by personalised lifestyle changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="100"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hep.29367" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2018 study published in Hepatology journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, one of the strongest genetic associations with NAFLD involves variants in the PNPLA3 gene, which influences fat storage in liver cells. Individuals with certain variants are more likely to accumulate liver fat even with modest risk exposure. It revealed, “Variations in the PNPLA3 gene are strongly associated with susceptibility to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and its severity.” Identifying such genetic risk factors allows for earlier lifestyle intervention, which is a true form of precision detox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="106"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="107"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bottom line&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="108"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many commercial detox diets promise to “clear toxins” in a matter of days, often through extreme restriction or supplementation but the evidence shows that the liver and gut already have powerful physiological detox systems:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="110"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="111"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The liver metabolises and eliminates endogenous and exogenous compounds through phases of biochemical transformation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The gut prevents harmful microbes from entering systemic circulation and contributes to metabolic regulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="112"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real goal is not quick fixes but lifestyle habits that reduce chronic metabolic stressors and support these innate systems over a lifetime. Actionable takeaways backed by science include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="114"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="115"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit added sugars, refined carbs and excess saturated fats —&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Research links these to fatty liver, metabolic dysfunction and gut disturbances.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay physically active throughout the day — &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Even modest movement improves liver metabolism and gut motility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support your microbiome with fibre-rich foods and fermented foods &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;that promote SCFA production.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage metabolic conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; such as obesity and diabetes to lower risk for liver and gut diseases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider genomic lifestyle assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; if you have a family history of IBS, NAFLD, or other digestive/metabolic disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="116"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Detox” will not ever be a one-week juice cleanse or a trendy reset package. True detox is about reducing lifetime exposure to metabolic stressors, strengthening the body’s own detoxification pathways and using science-based strategies to keep the gut and liver functioning optimally. As research continues, integrating diet, movement, microbiome support, chronic disease management and personalised genomic insights promises the most effective, enduring path to real biological detoxification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="121"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

sidewalk or your driveway — a traditional shovel may not be the most efficient option. Instead, experts recommend looking for a snow pusher: "The shovels now that can push/glide instead of having to physically lift are preferred," says Dr. Babaria. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This heavy-duty snow pusher is a top choice for clearing large areas. It features a wide 36-inch blade that can be angled in either direction and is mounted on large pneumatic tires that facilitate smooth pushing. Additionally, you can adjust the height and angle of the handle, so you can a position that's comfortable for your physique. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;a

to spend a little more, you may want to consider an electric snow shovel: "These are similar in size and style to regular shovels, yet they function more like snow throwers," says Steve Corcoran, CEO of landscaping company &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1;sec:large-product;subsec:commlist;pkgt:square-editorial;pos:9;cpos:3" href="https://lawnlove.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"

them still, but they send snow outward. So, they are a lot less physically demanding, since you aren’t actually manually shoveling in the same way."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This model from Earthwise is able to handle snow up to 8 inches deep, and it's mounted on wheels for easy pushing. It has a cordless design and adjustable front handle for better grip, and it can easily throw snow up to 30 feet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;a

live in an area that gets a lot of snow each year, it's worth upgrading to a snow blower to effortlessly clear your sidewalks and driveways. My 65-year-old father purchased this EGO POWER+ model around two years ago, and he raves about it every winter. Its self-propelled design moves forward automatically, and it's able to easily clear snow up to 20 inches deep. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This two-stage snow blower runs on dual 56-volt batteries, so there's no need to mess around with gas in the cold weather. It's easy to adjust how far it throws snow, as well as the chute angle, and it even has bright LED headlights for visibility during storms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;a data-ylk="aid:manual_29694407-b6a9-4044-826a-4ea9df538685_1765905047130;cpos:4;itmId:$1,649;ll3:product-available;ll4:productoffer-manual;pid:manual_29694407-b6a9-4044-826a-4ea9df538685_1765905047130;pdid:EGO POWER+ 24-in Two-stage Self-propelled Battery Snow Blower;subsec:commlist;elmt:chooseForMe;itemcost:$1,649;sellerN:Lowe's;pos:4;sec:large-product;elm:affiliate_link;itc:0;pkgt:horizontal-cta-1;slk:$1,649 at Lowe's;" class="peer clear-right box-border block w-full min-w-60 rounded-[40px] px-7 text-center hover:no-underline hover:opacity-100 active:opacity-60 @xl/p:w-9/12 rapid-with-clickid commerce-cta-btn-primary bg-article-ui-button py-3 font-semibold leading-5 text-article-ui-button-label hover:bg-article-ui-button-hover hover:text-grey-hair active:bg-article-ui-button-hover active:text-grey-hair peer-[&amp;amp;]:mt-3 dark:bg-white dark:text-batcave dark:hover:bg-bob dark:focus:bg-bob dark:active:bg-bob" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ba84e34b-21a4-4d54-b349-5490609c35f4&amp;amp;siteId=us-aol&amp;amp;pageId=pnr-product-module&amp;amp;contentUuid=29694407-b6a9-4044-826a-4ea9df538685&amp;amp;featureId=manual-entry&amp;amp;itemName=EGO+POWER%2B+24-in+Two-stage+Self-propelled+Battery+Snow+Blower&amp;amp;merchantName=Lowe%27s&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb3dlcy5jb20vcGQvRUdPLTI0SU4tMi1TVEFHRS1TTk9XLVRIUk9XRVItS0lULzEwMDMxMzA3MjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjI5Njk0NDA3LWI2YTktNDA0NC04MjZhLTRlYTlkZjUzODY4NSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubG93ZXMuY29tL3BkL0VHTy0yNElOLTItU1RBR0UtU05PVy1USFJPV0VSLUtJVC8xMDAzMTMwNzIwIn0&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAf8uPcpUW483E_t3MWJBM7YAHnFg3Qp9QtaD8A3lrSDv&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lowes.com%2Fpd%2FEGO-24IN-2-STAGE-SNOW-THROWER-KIT%2F1003130720&amp;amp;spaceId=1197803369" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;$1,649 at Lowe's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="tips-for-safely-shoveling-snow"&gt;Tips for safely shoveling snow&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having the right tools alone isn't enough to keep you safe while shoveling. It's also important to use proper technique and pace yourself while out in the cold winter weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few snow shoveling safety tips for seniors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warm up beforehand:&lt;/strong&gt; "A good stretch before you begin is essential to avoid injury. Head, neck, back, shoulders and hips should all be warmed up prior to shoveling," says Dr. Babaria. You may also want to walk in place for a few minutes to warm up your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternate sides when tossing:&lt;/strong&gt; "If lifting and throwing, seniors should alternate sides and distance they are going to throw," he explains. "Use proper bending techniques to avoid throwing out your back." Remember: Lift with your knees, not your back!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest in proper winter gear:&lt;/strong&gt; "Choose good footwear too — having a solid base to avoid slipping can ensure your foundation helps you push, pull, and throw," recommends chiropractor &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.drlhands.com/meet-dr-lief-hands/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Lief Hands;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Lief Hands&lt;/a&gt;.

Warning signs can be hard to see past the cold weather," says Dr. Hands. The snow isn't going anywhere, so take a break and come back later if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask for help:&lt;/strong&gt; If there's a lot of snow or you're not feeling well, there are many resources available to help with snow removal.

Past studies in rodents have shown that after exercise, the animals’ brains teem with a neurochemical called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF. Sometimes referred to as “Miracle-Gro for the brain,” BDNF helps spark the creation of new neurons. So it’s not surprising that after exercise, mouse and rat brains typically sprout two or three times as many new brain cells as the brains of sedentary animals. The exercising animals also ace rodent intelligence tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;People who exercise also show large increases in BDNF in their bloodstreams afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;Other studies have shown that as few as 25 minutes a week of walking, cycling, swimming or similar exercise can be strongly linked to greater brain volume in older people, while taking as few as 3,000 steps a day helps slow cognitive decline in people at high risk for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;But most of this research involved aerobic exercise and the brain effects of endurance. Fewer studies have looked at the role of muscle mass. Many questions also remain about the role of body fat on brain health, especially the deep, interior fat around our bellies known as visceral fat, which can increase inflammation throughout the body, including, potentially, in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;Is your brain young or old?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;For the new study, scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and other institutions decided to look deep inside people’s body tissues and brains with magnetic resonance imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;They turned to existing whole-body scans of 1,164 healthy men and women in their 40s, 50s or early 60s. “To understand dementia risk, we’ve got to focus on midlife,” said Cyrus Raji, an associate professor of radiology and neurology at Washington University School of Medicine and the study’s senior author. It’s in middle age that we typically start to develop - or avoid - most of the common risk factors for later dementia, he said, making it a critical time period to study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;The scientists used artificial intelligence to analyze the scans and determine people’s total muscle mass and body fat. The body fat was characterized as either visceral or subcutaneous, a different type of fat found just beneath our skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;The researchers figured out the apparent age of people’s brains using algorithms based on scans of tens of thousands of other brains. These provided benchmarks of typical brain structure and volume for someone of any age. People’s brains could either match the benchmarks for their chronological age, or look like those of people younger or older. Older-looking brains face heightened risks for early cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;More muscle means younger brains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;The researchers found that the amounts of people’s muscle mass and their visceral fat were both strongly linked to their apparent brain age, though in opposing ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;“The larger the muscle bulk, the younger-looking the brain,” Raji said. “And the more visceral fat that was present, the older-looking the brain.” People whose ratio of visceral fat to muscle mass was especially high - meaning they had a relatively large level of visceral fat and low muscle mass - tended to have the oldest-looking brains. (Subcutaneous fat was not linked to brain age in any way.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;The study didn’t look at how muscle and fat affect brains, but both tissues release a variety of biochemicals that can travel to the brain and jump-start various processes there, Raji said. The substances from muscles tend to promote the creation and integration of brain cells and neuronal connections; those from visceral fat do the reverse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;On a practical level, the findings underscore that resistance exercise “is super important” for healthy brain aging, Raji said. Most of us begin losing muscle mass in middle age, but strength training can slow or even reverse that decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;Shedding visceral fat is likewise a good idea for our brains, he said. Both aerobic and resistance exercise will target visceral fat. Using weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and other GLP-1 drugs can also substantially reduce visceral fat. But many people taking the drugs will drop muscle mass, Raji said - unless they also lift weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;The study has limitations. It hasn’t been published or peer-reviewed. Because it’s not an experiment, it also can’t show that more muscle and less belly fat cause brains to age more slowly - only that those conditions are all linked to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;But its findings are plausible and align with those of a growing number of other studies, said Fang Yu, director of the Roybal Center for Older Adults Living Alone with Cognitive Decline at Arizona State University in Phoenix. She studies exercise and aging but was not involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;Essentially, the study’s message is simple, actionable and even rhymes: If you want a younger, healthier brain, Raji said, “strength train.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Anchorage Daily News</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 00:45:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQdlJ1QWFySDJDT1I3cFJvNFhWb19qSEhTbmxtU1lfSWNLR3pBcm1zSDhleW1ITWNOMk1YRkwyLUNPTzNtQWV5cHVLNkRHSm9LRFlXNGlIc3phQWlyMzBSRTZvcWptN1EwZnkzLW1ZZUowTTdCZDV1cndWZGNrUS1WeDM2aS1UMUU4VEtKd2NwSk1jbTU3VERBY0tBM2xXWHg3UW1XUF9LQVp2NHlMa1pXQmV3</guid></item><item><title>随着犹他州、亚利桑那州和南卡罗来纳州病例增加，麻疹疫情不会在2025年结束- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreaks-no-end-2025-cases-mount-utah-arizona-south-carolina-rcna249743</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9c34e1" class="body-graf"&gt;As measles &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-south-carolina-quarantine-utah-arizona-us-rcna248435" target="_blank"&gt;continues to spread&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, it’s likely that the outbreaks that broke records in 2025 will continue into the new year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f8d56a" class="body-graf"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/2025-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, 168 people, mostly schoolchildren, are in quarantine. Most of the state's 138 cases confirmed since September, nearly all in unvaccinated people, have been centered in Spartanburg County in the northwestern part of the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a7d103" class="body-graf"&gt;“As we identify new cases, and if those cases have susceptible contacts, that’s a new 21-day quarantine period,” Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist for the state Department of Public Health, said Wednesday at what has become a weekly news briefing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a972cb" class="body-graf"&gt;That is, anyone who is unvaccinated and therefore vulnerable to measles exposures occurring now will be in quarantine through the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-811cd8" class="body-graf"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/map-kindergartner-vaccination-rates-are-lowest-rcna229455" target="_blank"&gt;NBC News data&lt;/a&gt;, the K-12 vaccination rate for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) in Spartanburg County was 90% for the 2024-25 school year, below the 95% level doctors say is needed to protect against an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7ec4f1" class="body-graf"&gt;Bell said the vaccination rate has been falling for several years, similar to other areas in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e6eb6e" class="body-graf"&gt;Based on NBC News' investigation, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/vaccine-divide/" target="_blank"&gt;The Vaccine Divide&lt;/a&gt;, in the states collecting data for the MMR vaccine, 67% of counties and jurisdictions have immunization rates below 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-538117" class="body-graf"&gt;Bell said at the briefing that there was no indication the South Carolina outbreak was spreading yet to nearby states, such as North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-099f9c" class="body-graf"&gt;Since the latest surge in cases, which began in late summer in the &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" target="_blank"&gt;bordering areas of southwestern Utah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;Arizona &lt;/a&gt;and, more recently, in South Carolina, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has taken a low profile, with nearly all public outreach about the nationwide outbreaks coming from local and state health departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5d6f3c" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s a stark contrast to how the agency has previously communicated about infectious diseases like measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-301ca0" class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41380254/" target="_blank"&gt;study published last week&lt;/a&gt; uncovered an “emerging health communication void” regarding measles and measles vaccines in the CDC’s social media accounts. The agency posted about measles 10 times on its social media channels from January through August, according to the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-722a8b" class="body-graf"&gt;During the same period from 2021 to 2024, the CDC posted an average of about 46 times each year, the study found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-edfaa8" class="body-graf"&gt;Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services (which oversees the CDC), said in an email that the “CDC has developed and distributed updated communication materials, including multilingual resources, to help communities respond to ongoing outbreaks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4d09b5" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC sends teams to investigate infectious disease hot spots only if states request it. Bell said the South Carolina Public Health Department hasn’t asked for extra help from the agency to contain the outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-feeb7d" class="body-graf"&gt;Separately, the measles outbreak largely straddling the border between Arizona and Utah also continues to swell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-28ad09" class="body-graf"&gt;The Utah Department of Health and Human Services reports 125 cases, with 21 diagnosed just in the last three weeks. According to the health department, there were multiple measles exposures last week in the southwestern part of the state, including at an elementary school, an urgent care facility, a pediatrician’s office and a pediatric dentistry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-60d3e0" class="body-graf"&gt;The Arizona Department of Health Services reports 190 cases, nearly all in Mohave County, which borders Utah. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c55398" class="body-graf"&gt;Nearly all of those cases, 97%, occurred among people who weren’t vaccinated against the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d59ec5" class="body-graf"&gt;As of Wednesday, the United States had logged 1,958 measles cases in 2025, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;latest update from the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. That’s just 168 cases shy of a previous high of 2,216 recorded in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-88ec0b" class="body-graf"&gt;There have been 49 outbreaks (defined as three or more related cases) reported in 2025.

			&lt;p&gt;How is it December already? What happened to 2025? And how did we suddenly jump from eating Easter eggs to putting up Christmas trees?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why our perception of time seems to bend and warp, we need to dig into how our brains tell time in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term "&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/ive-researched-time-for-15-years-heres-how-my-perception-of-it-has-changed-215499"&gt;time perception&lt;/a&gt;" is actually a bit of a misnomer, because time itself isn't "out there" to be perceived.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brain-goes-through-5-distinct-epochs-massive-study-finds"&gt;Your Brain Goes Through 5 Distinct Epochs, Massive Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we perceive a colour, a sound, a flavour or a touch, specialised sensory organs detect something in the environment: the wavelength of a light particle that enters the eye, the frequency of a sound wave that enters the ear, the presence of different chemicals in the mouth and nose, or the pressure of an object against our skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is no parallel for time – no "time particle" for the brain to detect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How brains deal with time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our brains don't perceive time – they infer it. Like the ticking of a clock, the brain estimates the passage of time by keeping track of change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But unlike a clock, the brain does not have regular ticks to count. To infer how much time has passed, the brain simply adds up how much happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you fill a time interval with exciting stuff, it seems to last longer. In the lab, a briefly presented flickering image &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1167/6.12.8"&gt;seems to last longer&lt;/a&gt; than a static image of the same duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/707641/original/file-20251210-64-curvv5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;rect=0%2C0%2C6000%2C4000&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Brains estimate time by keeping track of change. (&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/night-city-traffic-motion-blur-with-officer-35081258/"&gt;Jean-Guillaume Starnini/Pexels&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also why witnesses of highly intense events (such as car accidents) frequently report that time seems to slow down. Indeed, in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0001295"&gt;one well-known study&lt;/a&gt;, research participants fell backwards into a net from a height of more than 30 metres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they were subsequently asked to estimate the duration of their terrifying experience, they reported durations more than a third longer than when they judged someone else's fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intense arousal of the first-hand experience amplifies attention, in turn causing the brain to store dense, rich memories of events as they unfold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, when it needs to estimate how much time passed during the event, this unusually dense recollection of unfolding events causes the brain to overestimate how much time passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Time… flies?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand what happened to November and the rest of 2025, we also need to distinguish between telling time retrospectively (how much time has passed) versus prospectively (how fast time is passing now).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As every child knows, time spent waiting at the dentist passes much more slowly than time spent playing with a new toy. But why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, a key part of the story is how much is happening – and, specifically, what you're paying attention to. The more you pay attention to time itself, the more slowly it seems to pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The old adage states that time flies when you're having fun, but it doesn't necessarily need to be fun. Whatever you're attending to just needs to distract you from the passage of time. Keep your mind engaged, whether it's work or play, and time will slip away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But try staring at a clock for even five minutes, and you will feel how endless that seems, unless you let your mind wander. Boredom slows time right down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Routine makes the years fly by&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This disconnect between prospective and retrospective time perception also explains the saying "&lt;a href="https://gretchenrubin.com/articles/secret-of-adulthood-the-days-are-long-but-the-years-are-short/"&gt;the days are long but the years are short&lt;/a&gt;", a phenomenon that tends to increase as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we are young, lots of things are new: we go to school for the first time, enter a first relationship, start our first job. All these novel events form a rich store of memories that the brain later looks back on to conclude that a lot has happened, so a lot of time must have passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, when we get older, a lot of our daily tasks become more routine: bring the kids to school, go to work, cook dinner. As some previously novel parts of our day become routine, they become less interesting. Boring jobs cause time to slow down, creating the impression that the days crawl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-hidden-brain-state-before-sleep-may-be-the-key-to-human-genius"&gt;A Hidden Brain State Before Sleep May Be The Key to Human Genius&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically though, because these routine tasks are less exciting and novel, they leave weaker and less vivid memory traces. When our older brain therefore looks back to infer how much time has passed since the start of the year, it concludes that not much has happened, so it doesn't feel very long ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is at odds with our conscious knowledge that it's already December, and we are left wondering how the year flew by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do I slow down time, then?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slowing down time &lt;em&gt;as you're experiencing&lt;/em&gt; it is very easy, although completely dissatisfying: just get bored. Go wait at red traffic lights. Count to ten thousand in your head. Watch paint dry, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, slowing down &lt;em&gt;retrospective&lt;/em&gt; time is a little more difficult. Essentially, you need to make sure that come December, you have a year's worth of memories to show for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to do this is to prevent memories from fading, and the best way to do that is to rehash them. &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-01-29/how-to-stick-to-regular-journalling/100777232"&gt;Write things down&lt;/a&gt; in a diary or journal. Look back and reminisce. Keep your memories alive, and you'll keep your past alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other way to ensure you've got a year's worth of memories at year's end takes a little more initiative, but is a lot more inspiring. Because the best way to prevent the year from feeling like it flew by, is to fill it with lots of exciting memories of new, unique experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So explore. Go adventuring. Do something crazy – something you'll never forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your internal clock will thank you for it.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268982/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

He was 26, and had moved to Bristol a year earlier to start a "dream job" in the race cycling industry. So far, he had struggled to make friends.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I wasn't alone all the time, but […] I was a bit of an outsider," he remembers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;As he headed home, the streets were full of Halloween partygoers in monster and cat costumes. "I walked past people turning up to friend's houses, people running into shops to buy beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"All the pubs were full. It just [felt] like a different world that you're not part of. And you feel like you can never be part of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;That night, he felt like the only person experiencing serious loneliness. In fact, it is becoming a defining feature of his generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Conversations around social isolation tend to focus on the elderly, especially around Christmas. But by some measures, people in their 20s are the loneliest group in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/29cd/live/f4cc9130-d9c4-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/29cd/live/f4cc9130-d9c4-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/29cd/live/f4cc9130-d9c4-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/29cd/live/f4cc9130-d9c4-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/29cd/live/f4cc9130-d9c4-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/29cd/live/f4cc9130-d9c4-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/29cd/live/f4cc9130-d9c4-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/29cd/live/f4cc9130-d9c4-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Adam Becket Left: an image of Adam Becket on a walk.

But analysts say that in most research, young adults shine through as a particularly isolated group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Adults between 18 and 24 are the most lonely - followed by older people," says Prof Andrea Wigfield, director of the Centre for Loneliness Studies at Sheffield Hallam University. "It's a growing problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But why has this happened - and is there a solution?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;The problem of 'scattering'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Increasingly, experts say the modern world is to blame. Many twenty-somethings live in house-shares where they do not know or like their housemates. Work increasingly is done from home and friends are often spoken to on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It is not all bleak. Thanks to the internet, young adults enjoy access to friendships from all over the world. But broadly speaking, experts say, the image of gregarious twenty-something life presented in sitcoms like Friends needs urgent correction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/aca8/live/71c080a0-d9b3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/aca8/live/71c080a0-d9b3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aca8/live/71c080a0-d9b3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/aca8/live/71c080a0-d9b3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/aca8/live/71c080a0-d9b3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/aca8/live/71c080a0-d9b3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/aca8/live/71c080a0-d9b3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aca8/live/71c080a0-d9b3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="NBC Universal via Getty Images A still from the show Friends, with characters standing around in an apartment" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;NBC Universal via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;The 1990s sitcom 'Friends' paints a sociable picture of life for twenty-somethings - but according to young adults who have spoken to the BBC, along with academics, charity bosses and doctors, the 20s is a primary decade of loneliness&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We tend to romanticise young adulthood as a carefree time - when it's usually the most miserable time in people's lives," says Prof Richard Weissbourd, a lecturer in education at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In some ways, early adulthood has always been a time of instability. Young adults tend to leave their childhood home and move around. Friends depart, and family ties weaken. These transitory life events can, for some, lead to intense loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"A big problem is the scattering - everybody you ever knew now lives in a million different places," says Dr Meg Jay, a clinical psychologist and author of The Twenty-Something Treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This "scattering" proved difficult for Adam Becket. He had a rich social life when he lived in London in his early 20s - but after moving to Bristol, he had to make friends from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Not only did I not know anyone, I didn't know where to start meeting people either. You can't just go up to someone and be like, 'Can I join in this fun?' It's easy to spiral into self-doubt and self-flagellation - 'I'm clearly not interesting or cool, or the right kind of person.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Things improved when he joined running and cycling clubs and met people that he "clicked with" - though he says his loneliness still comes and goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;The Bowling Alone thesis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Today, there is also a set of new, distinctly modern factors that could be making the problem worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In many parts of the world, people are getting married and having children later (or not at all). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The average age of first marriage in the UK is now 31, according to the ONS, up from 1970 when it was 23 for men and 21 for women. Young adults tend to be more reliant on friends for emotional connection - and if those friends don't deliver, loneliness can follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Weissbourd points to a broader fragmenting of communities too. In rich countries, membership of civic institutions - like churches, community groups, or trade unions - has dropped since the 1970s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This is sometimes known as the Bowling Alone thesis, named after an influential 1995 essay by political scientist Robert Putnam, who observed that more young Americans were bowling on their own rather than in teams, a symbol of a wider collapse of social relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Twenty-somethings - who might have left their childhood home but not yet started their own family - can feel that decline of community most sharply, says Prof Weissbourd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We live in an increasingly individualistic society. I think loneliness is a symptom of our failure to care for each other."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7577/live/1e8da770-d9c5-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7577/live/1e8da770-d9c5-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7577/live/1e8da770-d9c5-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7577/live/1e8da770-d9c5-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7577/live/1e8da770-d9c5-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7577/live/1e8da770-d9c5-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7577/live/1e8da770-d9c5-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7577/live/1e8da770-d9c5-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A black and white image of young men and women bowling." class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;In the 1950s young Americans mostly bowled in teams; by the 1990s, more people bowled alone - a trend highlighted by Robert Putnam's famous essay&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This resonates with Zeyneb, 23, who lives alone in Cheltenham. Her own feelings of loneliness peaked last year during her master's degree. With only a few hours of teaching each week, she struggled to find meaningful connections with her classmates. And with her family far away in Romania, she now spends much of her time alone while she looks for a job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It does feel cripplingly lonely when everyone has their own thing to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She craves what psychologists call a "third place": a social setting like a park or library that is different from your "first place" (home) or your "second place" (work or university). "We don't really have that space to meet people," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The closest thing she can think of is her gym - but virtually everyone there wears headphones, she tells me, and few make eye contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;The urban houseshare paradox&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Then there is the post-pandemic rise in working from home. Though young adults in the UK don't work from home as often as older generations - 28% of 16-to-29-year-olds worked from home at least some of the time in the first quarter of 2025, compared with 54% of 30-to-49-year-olds, one study suggests - remote work can hit people in their 20s particularly hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Work from home has been, in my opinion, a nightmare for twenty-somethings," says Dr Jay. "It's really hard to make friends when you don't leave the house."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Nor do shared living situations always help. There is something of a paradox here, as young adults are the most likely to live with other people. (In England and Wales only 5% of people in their early 20s live alone, versus 49% of over-85s, suggests the ONS.) But living under the same roof as others doesn't always seem to make young adults any less lonely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Some of my most pitiful memories of my 20s were being stuck living with people that I didn't like," recalls Dr Jay. "If I was having a hard time, they didn't care, they were too wrapped up in themselves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Of course this isn't the case for all house-shares - but she thinks having an emotionally distant flatmate can make people "even more lonely" than if they lived alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;'Compare and despair' on smartphones&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;All of this is complicated by smartphones and social media. This year, the average British 18-to-24-year-old spent six hours and 20 minutes online every day, according to the media regulator Ofcom, higher than other adult age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some might assume that apps like Instagram and Snapchat contribute to feelings of loneliness because they encourage people to speak online rather than in person - but the data doesn't cleanly support this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;What is certainly true, say some experts, is that social media &lt;i id="amplifies" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;amplifies&lt;/i&gt; pre-existing feelings of loneliness because of what Dr Jay calls the "compare and despair" factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"You feel like, 'Everybody seems to have best friends and they're all skydiving in Dubai - what's wrong with me, I didn't see anyone all weekend.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e514/live/d5e626a0-d9ba-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e514/live/d5e626a0-d9ba-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e514/live/d5e626a0-d9ba-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e514/live/d5e626a0-d9ba-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e514/live/d5e626a0-d9ba-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e514/live/d5e626a0-d9ba-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e514/live/d5e626a0-d9ba-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e514/live/d5e626a0-d9ba-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Four men stand in a queue, looking at their smartphones." class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;The average young adult in the UK spends 6 hours and 20 minutes online every day, according to media regulator Ofcom&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Yet it is also possible that reporting biases are playing a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Studies about loneliness are mostly based on self-report surveys (meaning people are simply asked whether they feel lonely). And Prof Weissbourd says it is plausible that young adults, who tend to be more fluent in the language of mental health and therapy, are more likely than older people to describe themselves as lonely in surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He thinks reporting biases may explain a "piece" of the puzzle - but certainly not all of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Wigfield also thinks the high level of young-adult loneliness is a real phenomenon, not a statistical mirage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;The 'lottery' of social prescribing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;At first, David Gradon's story was fairly typical. In his late 20s, his friends moved away from London. "My social circle really shrunk," he remembers - and he developed symptoms of depression. It was an NHS counsellor who suggested this could be loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He tried meeting people over dating apps (a "terrible" idea) and joined a tag rugby club, but injured his leg in the first session. Increasingly despondent, he organised a park walk on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One autumn day in 2021, Mr Gradon and 11 strangers met at Hampstead Heath in north London. He organised more walks and in time this became his full-time job. He now runs The Great Friendship Project, a non-profit group to combat young adult loneliness, which runs social events for under-35s across London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Everyone's in that same boat. And actually, that brings down barriers. Because you know you're not going to be judged," he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7336/live/bc1d8fc0-d9b4-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7336/live/bc1d8fc0-d9b4-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7336/live/bc1d8fc0-d9b4-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7336/live/bc1d8fc0-d9b4-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7336/live/bc1d8fc0-d9b4-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7336/live/bc1d8fc0-d9b4-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7336/live/bc1d8fc0-d9b4-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7336/live/bc1d8fc0-d9b4-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="The Great Friendship Project A group of people stand in a park, some of them wearing dinosaur costumes." class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;The Great Friendship Project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;David Gradon's non-profit group organises park walks and other events for under-35s in London&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Council-funded youth clubs operate around the country. Most are currently aimed at teenagers and children, but Laura Cunliffe-Hall, head of policy at charity UK Youth, wants to see more clubs for people in their early 20s. She argues that youth work should serve everyone up to the age of 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Funding, she says, is the barrier. Local authority spending on youth services in England fell by 73% between 2010/11 and 2023/24, according to the charity YMCA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some argue that spending money on friendship services can save money over the long term, because the health consequences of long-term loneliness can be severe. Prof Wigfield says that chronic loneliness is linked to inflammation, and can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and dementia in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In recent years the NHS has invested in "social prescribing", where GPs connect patients with certain mental health problems to charity-run services in their area - like art classes or gardening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;More than one million people (of all ages) were referred to NHS social prescribing services in 2023, a recent study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But Prof Wigfield says infrastructure remains patchy. "It really is a lottery in terms of where you live [and] whether the GP has knowledge of local services."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/85db/live/ad0b3960-d9b4-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/85db/live/ad0b3960-d9b4-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/85db/live/ad0b3960-d9b4-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/85db/live/ad0b3960-d9b4-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/85db/live/ad0b3960-d9b4-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/85db/live/ad0b3960-d9b4-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/85db/live/ad0b3960-d9b4-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/85db/live/ad0b3960-d9b4-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="The Great Friendship Project People walking through a London park" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;The Great Friendship Project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Virtually all attendees come alone, meaning everyone's "in the same boat", says David Gradon of The Great Friendship Project&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Looking ahead to the next decade, Dr Jay sees signs of hope. For one, she thinks working from home has "lost some of its lustre" among twenty-somethings. (Several large employers - including Barclays and WPP - asked staff to spend longer in the office this year.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Jay also notes that some high-profile people are turning against social media - though she says there is not yet much evidence of a significant fall in usage among young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I'd love to see more of a backlash against [social media], but it's just so in our pockets," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Then there are those who find their solution to loneliness in unexpected places.

From 2003 to August 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) has &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.paho.org/en/documents/epidemiological-update-avian-influenza-ah5n1-americas-region-15-october-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 990 human H5N1 cases across 25 countries, including 475 deaths - a 48% fatality rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In the US alone, the virus has struck more than 180 million birds, spread to over 1,000 dairy herds in 18 states, and infected at least 70 people - mostly farmworkers - causing several hospitalisations and one death. In January, three tigers and a leopard died at a wildlife rescue centre in India's Nagpur city from the virus that typically infects birds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Symptoms in humans mimic a severe flu: high fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches and, at times, conjunctivitis. Some people have no symptoms at all. The risk to humans remains low, but authorities are watching H5N1 closely for any shift that could make it spread more easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;That concern is what prompted new peer-reviewed modelling by Indian researchers Philip Cherian and Gautam Menon of Ashoka University, which simulates how an H5N1 outbreak might unfold in humans and what early interventions could stop it before it spreads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In other words, the&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12889-025-25358-5" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt; model &lt;/a&gt;published in the BMC Public Health journal uses real world data and computer simulations to play out how an outbreak might spread in real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"The threat of an H5N1 pandemic in humans is a genuine one, but we can hope to forestall it through better surveillance and a more nimble public-health response," Prof Menon told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A bird flu pandemic, researchers say, would begin quietly: a single infected bird passing the virus to a human - most likely a farmer, market worker or someone handling poultry. From there, the danger lies not in that first infection but in what happens next: sustained human-to-human transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Because real outbreaks start with limited, messy data, the researchers turned to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bharatsim.ashoka.edu.in/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;BharatSim&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source simulation platform originally built for Covid 19 modelling, but versatile enough to study other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Hindustan Times via Getty Images A worker at National Zoological Park sprays pesticides at the entrance gate to sanitize the premises as bird flu spread in the zoo area on 1 September, 2025 in New Delhi, India.

Secondary contacts are those who have not met the infected person but have been in close contact with a primary contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If households of primary contacts are quarantined when just two cases are detected, the outbreak can almost certainly be contained, the research found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But by the time 10 cases are identified, it is overwhelmingly likely that the infection has already spread into the wider population, making its trajectory virtually indistinguishable from a scenario with no early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;To keep the study grounded in real-world conditions, the researchers chose a model of a single village in Namakkal district, Tamil Nadu - the heart of India's poultry belt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Namakkal is home to more than 1,600 poultry farms and some 70 million chickens; it produces over 60 million eggs a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A village of 9,667 residents was generated using a synthetic community - households, workplaces, market spaces - and seeded with infected birds to mimic real-life exposure. (A synthetic community is an artificial, computer-generated population that mimics the characteristics and behaviours of a real population.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In the simulation, the virus starts at one workplace -  a mid-sized farm or wet market - spreads first to people there (primary contacts), and then moves outward to others (seconday contacts) they interact with through homes, schools and other workplaces.  Homes, schools and workplaces formed a fixed network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;By tracking primary and secondary infections, the researchers estimated key transmission metrics, including the basic reproductive number, R0 - which measures how many people, on average, one infected person passes the virus on to. In the absence of a real-world pandemic, the researchers instead modelled a range of plausible transmission speeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Then they tested what happens when different interventions - culling birds, quarantining close contacts and targeted vaccination - kicked in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The results were blunt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Culling of birds works - but only if done before the virus infects a human. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If a spillover does occur, timing becomes everything, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Isolating infected people and quarantining households can stop the virus at the secondary stage. But once tertiary infections appear - friends of friends, or contacts of contacts - the outbreak slips out of control unless authorities impose much tougher measures, including lockdowns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Targeted vaccination helps by raising the threshold at which the virus can sustain itself, though it does little to change the immediate risk within households.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Bloomberg via Getty Images Chicks at a poultry farm in Kachhawa village, near Karnal, Haryana, India." class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;India's poultry industry is one of the world's largest&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The simulations also highlighted an awkward trade-off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Quarantine, introduced too early, keeps families together for long stretches - and increases the chance that infected individuals will pass the virus to those they live with. Introduced too late, it does little to slow the outbreak at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The researchers say this approach comes with caveats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The model relies on one synthetic village, with fixed household sizes, workplaces and daily movement patterns. It does not include simultaneous outbreaks seeded by migratory birds or by poultry networks. Nor does it account for behavioural shifts - mask-wearing, for instance - once people know birds are dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Atlanta-based Emory University, adds another caveat: this simulation model "assumes a very efficient transmission of influenza viruses".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Transmission is complex and not every strain will have the same efficiency as another," she says, adding that scientists are also now starting to understand that not all people infected with seasonal flu spread the virus equally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She says emerging research shows that only a "subset of flu-positive individuals actually shed infectious influenza virus into the air". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This mirrors the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51447143" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;super-spreader phenomenon&lt;/a&gt; seen with Covid-19, though it is far less well characterised for flu - a gap that could strongly influence how the virus spreads through human populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;What happens if H5N1 becomes successful in the human population?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Lakdawala believes that it "will cause a large disruption likely more similar to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/influenza-a-%28h1n1%29-outbreak?utm_source=chatgpt.com" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;2009 [swine flu] pandemic&lt;/a&gt; rather than Covid-19".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"This is because we are more prepared for an influenza pandemic.

Such mixing could reshape seasonal influenza, triggering "chaotic and unpredictable seasonal epidemics".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The Indian modellers say the simulations can be run in real time and updated as data come in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;With refinements - better reporting delays, asymptomatic cases - they could give public-health officials something priceless in the early hours of an outbreak: a sense of which actions matter most, before the window for containment snaps shut.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;i id="follow-bbc-news-india-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;Follow BBC News India on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;&lt;i id="youtube," class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;YouTube,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBCIndia" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 23:56:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBYeDhIZ0tyYXBIUjN6RzdQLTFlT05oTkFTLTlSSHdYOG9SVjZwT21lVHF3a1ZURjRxa0NrQ1YtYnZfRlREbkVMX3FOUDh4QjVTczk0WGdyemJPd9IBX0FVX3lxTE1mbTc0bWczN0R4ZGRGNWpWaUhLVklKSEdpQWNTTXlmSXJJWGFTeDdsSWFjLVFYemxCdnJfWkpJUXlOcFBic0dRNGJLR0NZbW1TQ01seWtfYVNjc0pFU09R</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，洛杉矶森林大火后心脏病发作增加-《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/17/los-angeles-wildfires-heart-attacks</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the first 90 days after the devastating Palisades and Eaton fires that destroyed entire Los Angeles neighborhoods, there was a 46% increase in ER visits for heart attack symptoms at LA’s Cedars-Sinai hospital, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.10.079" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;newly released study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Rates of heart attacks in January 2025 actually surpassed heart attack rates during all the prior Januaries, even during the Covid years,” Dr Susan Cheng, director of public health research at Cedars-Sinai and the study’s senior author, told the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Residents in the zip codes directly affected by the January wildfires or located adjacent to a fire-affected area also reported a 24% increase in pulmonary illness and a staggering 118% increase in blood test abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Palisades fire was the &lt;a href="https://www.wildfirela.org/history/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;most destructive fire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; history, destroying 6,800 structures and killing 12 people. To the east, the Eaton fire devastated the neighborhood of Altadena, with 19 confirmed deaths. More than &lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2025/1/7/eaton-fire/updates/262ba0be-593a-463c-94b1-a15d1e7f2a1e" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;9,400 structures&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed across Altadena and neighboring Pasadena and Sierra Madre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The findings, which were released in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, are part of &lt;a href="https://lafirehealth.org/data/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a research project&lt;/a&gt; on the short- and long-term impact of the fires on human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cedars-Sinai medical center is located approximately 10 and 20 miles from the epicenters of the Palisades and Eaton fires, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“What we saw during the wildfires was an excess of respiratory illness showing up in our ER that matched the worst years of Covid,” Cheng said. “And that was striking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While some increased respiratory illness was expected due to the effects of wildfire smoke,Cheng said she was surprised not only by the percentage of increase, but also by the jump in heart attack incidences and blood test abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“For a very large number of people, the January wildfire exposures led to a biochemical or metabolic stress on the body that likely affected, not just one, but multiple organ systems,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The blood test data came from patients who reported physical symptoms that did not have a clear diagnosis, such as dizziness without clear signs of dehydration or chest pains without other signs of a heart attack. Cheng noted that the patients’ blood tests revealed subtle abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The blood tests could show their electrolytes were a little bit off, like sodium, potassium, or there’s a slight imbalance in their protein levels,” she said. “Or there’s a slight change in markers of kidney and liver function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Palisades and Eaton fires were particularly harmful to human health due to their classification as a “wildland-urban interface fire (WUI)”. This type of fire spreads more easily than a wildfire-only or urban-only fire, burning a combination of organic materials and industrial fuels, such as plastic, batteries, and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While the data collected by Chang and her colleagues is a start, there are still many questions left to be answered on the long-term effects of January’s fires on human health. “There’s a lot of work to do,” she said. “We’re still working hard to put the pieces together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 23:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQaEwxdlNHd1N3czBWeDJESHJTU1hENVVpQ0lVY0pjS3h2VWZnTENmOXBLZkstYk5WekpEb3BYWUt0SmdpczlvZmFBaHZiTlA5REM3MEw0NUk3R1Y2YkNuZnpDWUJqSnBZVm9xd296ZlpsQUs2R1Fxc2s2OTd2Y2V4R2l0eEZNMG9TSkxz</guid></item><item><title>被亚特兰大地铁皮肤科医生毁容的男子家庭获得了5680万美元的$ - WSB-TV</title><link>https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/family-man-disfigured-by-metro-atlanta-dermatologist-awarded-568-million/ZEL7NJ5RHRBVLL2RSTMUNRUULE/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="default__ArticleBody-sc-tl066j-1 jPcFTl article-body-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;FULTON COUNTY, Ga. — A jury awarded more than $50 million to the estate of Vietnam veteran Tony Waldrop after finding that a doctor disfigured him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;In 2013, Waldrop was suffering from skin cancer on his right ear and was getting treated at the VA for years with no problems.

It also counters something that speeds brain aging up: having more hidden abdominal fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Healthier bodies with more muscle mass and less hidden belly fat are more likely to have healthier, youthful brains,” senior study author Dr. Cyrus Raji, associate professor of radiology and neurology in the Department of Radiology at Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251125112506.htm" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251125112506.htm"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;. “Better brain health, in turn, lowers the risk for future brain diseases, such as Alzheimer’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Raji said it’s well known that chronological aging leads to loss of muscle mass and more hidden belly fat. But the study shows that those two things are involved in brain health — and that positive change is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Study-details" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Study details&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers used full-body magnetic resonance imaging to look at fat, muscle and brain tissue. Besides quantifying the fat and muscle, they also used the brain’s structure to estimate its biological age in the 1,164 healthy adults participating in the study, which was conducted at four different sites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Just over half of the study participants were women and the average age was barely over 55 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;An artificial intelligence algorithm was created to measure total normalized muscle volume, hidden belly fat (visceral fat), fat under the skin (subcutaneous fat) and the predicted brain age based on imaging. It showed that those who had higher visceral-fat-to-muscle ratio appeared to have older brains. Subcutaneous fat was not significant to how old the brain appeared to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In April, a smaller study from Brazil had similar findings on brain protection from dementia, though it didn’t talk about fat. Forty-four adults with cognitive impairment were followed and those who did strength training for six months showed improvements in both memory and brain anatomy, while those who didn’t use weights showed decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The results of that study, by researchers at State University of Campinas, were &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-024-01483-8" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal GeroScience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Hit-those-weights" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Hit those weights&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;People have the power to change the trajectory in this particular case. Raji said working to build muscle and reduce hidden belly fat are “realistic and actionable” goals. He also noted that whole-body MRI and brain age estimates generated by artificial intelligence provide benchmarks that can be used to create programs that lower visceral fat while they also increase muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Moreover, the research — like many studies that have come before it — offers strong evidence that physical health and brain health are related and directly impact each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“This research has validated widely held hypotheses about the association between body composition biomarkers and brain health and provides a foundation for those biomarkers to be included in future trials of various metabolic interventions and treatments,” Raji said in the written statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Can-weight-loss-drugs-help" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Can weight-loss drugs help?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The university release also talked about weight-loss drugs and how they can interact with the findings. That, it seems, is a bit of a mixed bag. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Per the release, “Commonly prescribed glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) weight loss medications, including Ozempic, are effective at reducing body fat but may also contribute to muscle loss. Dr. Raji suggested that the study’s findings could help guide the development of next-generation therapies. These future treatments may aim to reduce visceral fat more than subcutaneous fat while protecting muscle mass.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers said they hope their findings will help inform a new generation of weight-loss efforts that focus on hidden body fat and muscle volume, to the benefit of the brain’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 23:00:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxQQjc3X1QwTEo2ckNYbGtqdVhvandudElyblowT0lua0p4NzA4aEY1Z1lldTBKS3JsdW9mRkQtUFRnOVM2OFZxbVl3T0VBV09MaTJwelg3WTV3MUdSTWZCOUZNdFhhdXF1ZW5vUEtvc2tSa0VYMG05UDA0T2dQVHl2bVVsbEt1OGtydmxvQXZjYlZ5Z3ZNREw1U2NJLVVYbDNrYW9Jck55WVdiLThRNXNFR0gwR2hBWUZXTzdRc3YtVEt6QQ</guid></item><item><title>流感季节从WakeMed开始限制游客- WRAL</title><link>https://www.wral.com/news/local/wakemed-flu-season-visitor-restrictions-december-2025/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Seasonal visitation restrictions at WakeMed’s facilities will go into effect on Dec. 22 to try to limit the spread of illness during flu season.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Starting on the 22nd, children younger than 12 will not be allowed to visit patients in WakeMed hospital nursing units, patient care areas and waiting rooms. The measure is to prevent the spread of respiratory syncytial virus and the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The policy includes Healthplex emergency departments and WakeMed Mental Health and Well-Being Hospital – WakeBrook.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"We truly understand that this annual visitation restriction can be difficult for families, but we are committed to ensuring our patients are safe while they are in our care," said a WakeMed spokesperson. "Restricting visitation is best clinical practice to prevent the spread of viruses within our facilities."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/flu-deaths-north-carolina-october-2025/"&gt;Eleven people have died from the flu in North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; as of Wednesday, Dec. 17, for the 2025-2026 flu season.&lt;/p&gt;

Likewise, a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2024/12/09/sugary-drinks-raise-cardiovascular-disease-risk-frontiers-public-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by a group of Swedish researchers has gone so far as to directly condemn the sugar drink industry for cases of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When you drink a can of regular Coca-Cola, your body experiences a sugar rush within the first hour of consumption. Since Coca-Cola contains caffeine as well as sugar, drinking soda consistently can also cause you to develop a "degree of dependence," per the Telegraph. This dependency can then cause some consistent cola drinkers to "wean themselves off it gradually to lessen the effects of the caffeine and sugar withdrawal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is the new set of research important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new research reinforces the health risks of regularly drinking Coca-Cola. What's worse, in the United Kingdom, experts are also calling out the country's food labeling system, which gives Coca-Cola three green traffic lights, a label that is &lt;a href="http://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/educate-yourself-about-greenwashing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:misleading for consumers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;misleading for consumers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Coke is just through the roof [for sugar]," specialist registered dietitian Nichola Ludlam-Raine told the Telegraph. "In my opinion, it shouldn't be allowed to be sold."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;From an environmental perspective, Coca-Cola is the world's leading producer of branded plastic waste, and while the company has taken some steps to mitigate its plastic waste, it still has a significant way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about the health risks of Coca-Cola?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers are continuing to study the long-term impacts of drinking soda, adding to the growing pile of evidence underscoring the health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To protect yourself from these risks, you can reduce your soda intake.

as food&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by Luz María Alzate Tamayo, a food scientist at the &lt;a href="https://lasalle.edu.co/es/wps/portal/Home/Principal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lasallian University Corporation&lt;/a&gt; in Colombia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her research focuses on how this carob-like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gold-found-growing-in-norway-spruce-christmas-tree-needles-finland-forests/"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt; can supply safe natural ingredients for the food industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hymenaea courbaril is native to tropical forests from southern Mexico through the Amazon basin and into parts of the Caribbean. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local people know it by many names, including algarrobo, guapinol, and jatobá, and value it both as shade and as food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each pod is built like a tough container, with a woody shell and a dry but edible pulp pressed around the seeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pale pulp tastes slightly sweet and floury, and it dries well, which makes it easy to mill and store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For centuries, communities across these regions have milled the pulp into flour for porridges, drinks, and simple baked foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tree has also fed animals and supported traditional remedies for digestive troubles and chronic respiratory infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lab-tested-nutrients"&gt;Lab tested nutrients&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One detailed &lt;a href="https://www.scielo.cl/pdf/rchnut/v47n3/0717-7518-rchnut-47-03-0366.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; looked at pulp flour and fibrous residue from a Brazilian variety known as &lt;em&gt;jatobá da mata&lt;/em&gt; and measured its nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That team found 44 grams of dietary fiber, indigestible plant material that adds bulk, and 11 grams of protein per 100 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrition researchers describe these concentrated fractions as functional foods, everyday products formulated to deliver a health benefit beyond basic calories and protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulp flour blended into breads, snacks, and breakfast foods could lift fiber intake without adding sugar or synthetic additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The better known Mediterranean carob &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/slow-and-steady-tree-growth-wins-the-race-for-carbon-capture/"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ceratonia siliqua&lt;/em&gt;, supplies cocoa like powders and drinks that use most of the pod instead of discarding it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent scientific &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5710/11/1/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; described these beverages as naturally sweet, caffeine free, and rich in polyphenols, fiber, and minerals for health focused consumers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hymenaea-courbaril-as-medicine"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hymenaea courbaril&lt;/em&gt; as medicine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern studies show that the jatobá &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/giant-trees-never-seen-before-up-to-3000-years-old-tessmannia-princeps-tasmania/"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt; carries many polyphenols, plant molecules that can neutralize reactive oxygen and other unstable chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In bark, leaf, and seed extracts, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6382/12/11/1601" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; saw strong inhibition of &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; growth at relatively low concentrations in culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These same preparations scored high in tests of antioxidant capacity, a measure of how well a substance blocks damage from reactive oxygen molecules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some tests, leaf extracts from &lt;em&gt;Hymenaea courbaril&lt;/em&gt; matched or exceeded strong synthetic antioxidants, showing that the foliage is chemically very active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work on pod residues, the material left after the edible pulp, highlights compounds called procyanidins, flavonoid chains that give astringent taste and antioxidant behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That study found these molecules alongside quercetin and taxifolin derivatives, giving extracts a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39599418/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt; that might support antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects in foods and possibly people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional medicine in Brazil and Colombia reflects these findings, using jatobá sap and bark decoctions as tonics for chronic coughs, fatigue, and difficult infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early experiments hint at wound healing and liver protective effects in animals, yet doctors still need larger controlled studies before trusting those claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lessons-from-hymenaea-courbaril"&gt;Lessons from &lt;em&gt;Hymenaea courbaril&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For food companies, the big industrial hook lies in the seed gum, a family of galactomannans, carbohydrates that swell and thicken water based mixtures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seed gums from Hymenaea courbaril appear structurally similar, which is why scientists expect them to behave much like the carob based gums used today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In regulatory language, carob bean gum, also called locust bean gum, is classified as a thickener and stabilizer rather than as a flavoring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Joint FAO and WHO expert &lt;a href="https://apps.who.int/food-additives-contaminants-jecfa-database/Home/Chemical/940" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;committee&lt;/a&gt; says carob bean gum has no set intake limit for the general population at approved uses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, seed gum from carob-like trees can stabilize ice creams and dairy desserts by binding water and slowing ice crystal growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That smoother texture can allow recipe developers to cut fat or sugar while delivering creamy products that keep structure during transport and storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this chemistry matters because isolated fiber fractions from carob relatives have shown direct effects on blood lipids in people with high cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one clinical &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14569404/"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, 15 grams of carob fiber for six weeks reduced LDL cholesterol by 10.5 percent in adults with high levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40905618_Propiedades_farmacologicas_del_Algarrobo_Hymenaea_courbaril_Linneaus_de_interes_para_la_industria_de_alimentos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revista Lasallista de Investigación&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Someone with measles last week traveled through terminal two
of Raleigh-Durham International Airport while infected, according to the state
and Wake County.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services
[DHHS] said the person lives in another state.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"Measles is a highly contagious disease and it spreads
quickly in children and adults who are not vaccinated," said State
Epidemiologist Zack Moore. "All North Carolinians should ensure that they
and their families are up to date on their MMR vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The person arrived in the early morning of Dec. 10 at the
terminal, according to the DHHS.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;There is no known health risk at the Raleigh-Durham
International Airport as of Wednesday, according to the state.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Public health leaders are recommending all unvaccinated
individuals ages 1 year and older receive measles vaccination to protect
themselves and those around them. Measles vaccine is also recommended for
infants 6-11 months who will be traveling internationally or to areas with
active measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Any person that was in terminal 2 between 4 a.m. to 8 a.m.
on Wednesday, Dec. 10 could have been exposed to measles and should monitor for
measles-like symptoms until Jan. 1, 2026. The state also urges anyone there to &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/ncdhhs.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=58ec19aaea4630b1baad0e5e4&amp;amp;id=e6db9e9c41&amp;amp;e=00ecd6c0b8__;!!M5erwxGTI6mlTHJSECWB8LY!E1F1tNNYg0x5orCc-_-U5yI4Q7JlFsXwLVlYfxtXDcJ18UHnX9pHgzDSDQTo2_FiVAVR7zsa2jU4hQ$"&gt;contact

						&lt;p&gt;As of Dec. 9, 2025, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention has reported 1,912 people from 43 states as confirmed measles cases
this year. This is the highest number of measles cases reported in the U.S.
since the second dose of MMR vaccine became widely used in the early 1990s. No
cases of measles have been identified in North Carolina residents in 2025,
though a confirmed case was identified in June in a child who traveled to North
Carolina from another country where measles outbreaks had recently been
reported.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Measles is a respiratory disease that is spread through the
air by coughing and sneezing. It can also be transmitted through contact with
secretions from the nose or mouth of an infected person. The virus can live for
up to two hours in the air where the infected person was present. Symptoms of
measles usually begin seven to 14 days after exposure, but can appear up to 21
days after exposure and may include:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (may spike to more than 104 degrees)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots on the inner cheeks, gums and roof of the mouth (Koplik Spots) two to three days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that is red, raised, blotchy; usually starts on face, spreads to trunk, arms and legs three to five days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Measles can lead to severe complications like pneumonia and
encephalitis, especially in young children. Globally, measles killed
approximately 95,000 people in 2024, with most of those being unvaccinated
children 5 and under. This number has dropped 88% since 2000 thanks to
vaccination efforts, meaning measles vaccines saved nearly 59 million lives
since that time.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Vaccinations are safe, effective and remain the best way to
prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and death from respiratory viral
infections and from vaccine-preventable infections like measles. Measles can be
prevented by the combination MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/ncdhhs.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=58ec19aaea4630b1baad0e5e4&amp;amp;id=73eee22f8e&amp;amp;e=00ecd6c0b8__;!!M5erwxGTI6mlTHJSECWB8LY!E1F1tNNYg0x5orCc-_-U5yI4Q7JlFsXwLVlYfxtXDcJ18UHnX9pHgzDSDQTo2_FiVAVR7zvEVZIDWQ$"&gt;The
MMR vaccine is highly effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing measles, and it is
recommended that all adults and children 1 year and older be up to date on

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sourdough’s long fermentation boosts digestion and gut health by increasing probiotics, prebiotics, and reducing hard-to-digest carbs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its fermentation also reduces gluten and phytates, improving nutrient absorption—though it’s still not safe for people with celiac disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compared with most breads, sourdough has a lower glycemic index and offers antioxidant benefits that support blood sugar control and reduce oxidative stress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you eat sourdough bread, you're getting more than a delicious base for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/853635/favorite-sandwich-recipes" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sandwiches&lt;/a&gt; and toast. You'll also experience many benefits for health, as the bread is high in essential nutrients. In fact, sourdough bread is considered to be one of the &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/healthiest-breads-to-eat-11701423" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;best breads to eat&lt;/a&gt;, particularly if you choose a loaf with a minimal ingredients list. Yet, you might wonder: What happens to the body when you eat sourdough, and how does it compare to other varieties of bread? We spoke with dietitians to find out.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sourdough bread is made of flour, water, salt, and a starter. "A &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/how-to-make-sourdough-starter-8547141" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sourdough starter&lt;/a&gt; is made using water and flour that is fermented for approximately seven days (or more) in order to develop an active culture, contributing to its flavor and ability to rise," says Samantha Coogan, MS, RDN, LD, FAND, registered dietitian nutritionist, program director of the didactic program in nutrition and dietetics, and senior lecturer at the department of kinesiology and nutrition sciences at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. This is different from other breads, which use traditional dry yeast to rise, says Connie Elick, RD,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;registered dietitian and health-centered culinary arts instructor at the Institute of Culinary Education.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are the effects of consuming sourdough.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Improved Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since sourdough bread undergoes a longer fermentation process than regular breads, it contains beneficial bacteria, says Elick. These bacteria, known as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/best-probiotic-foods-11791312" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, are advantageous for digestion. "Sourdough is also a good source of fiber and prebiotics, which is what feeds probiotics," says Coogan. This is important because a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/8197882/best-recipes-gut-health" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthy gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; can help strengthen the immune system, reduce inflammation, and possibly improve mental health, says Elick.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Easier Digestion &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have gluten sensitivity or irritable bowel disease, eating sourdough vs. other breads might be easier on your GI tract. According to Coogan, the fermentation process decreases FODMAPs (i.e., poorly absorbed carbs) and gluten, making it easier to digest. But take note: Sourdough "is not safe for those with Celiac disease due to the lingering gluten content," says Coogan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Reduced Oxidative Stress &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sourdough contains selenium, an essential nutrient for optimal health, says Elick. "Selenium functions as an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/antioxidant-foods-11765686" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant&lt;/a&gt; that protects us from toxins and free radicals that can cause oxidative damage," notes Elick. As a result, it keeps cells, DNA, and proteins safe, she says.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Improved Blood Sugar Control &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sourdough has a lower glycemic index than most other breads. (A food's glycemic index measures how quickly it increases blood sugar.) This is due to the fermentation process, which makes the starch portion of the bread less readily available for digestion and absorption in the bloodstream, says Coogan. Thus, compared to other types of bread, sourdough won't raise your blood sugar levels as quickly, according to Coogan. The result? A lower risk for type 2 diabetes and related complications.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Enhanced Nutrient Absorption &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you eat sourdough bread, you'll be able to absorb more nutrients vs. when you consume other varieties of bread. That's because sourdough contains fewer phytates, or "anti-nutrient" compounds found in grains. Phytates "bind to certain minerals such as zinc and iron, preventing them from being absorbed," says Elick. However, "the longer, more acidic fermentation process of sourdough makes it possible to break down more phytates than regular bread," says Elick. This paves the way for better nutrient absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
