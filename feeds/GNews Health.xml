			&lt;p&gt;Stores of glucose in the brain could play a much more significant role in the pathological degeneration of neurons than scientists realized, opening the way to new treatments for conditions like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="166540" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's is a tauopathy; a condition characterized by harmful build-ups of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_protein"&gt;tau proteins&lt;/a&gt; inside neurons. It's not clear, however, if these build-ups are a cause or a consequence of the disease. &lt;span&gt;A new study now adds important detail by revealing significant interactions between tau and glucose in its stored form of glycogen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in the US, the research sheds new light on the functions of glycogen in the brain. Before now, it's only been regarded as an energy backup for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-unexpected-link-between-diet-and-lung-cancer-risk"&gt;the liver and the muscles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This new study challenges that view, and it does so with striking implications," &lt;a href="https://www.buckinstitute.org/news/neurons-burn-sugar-differently-the-discovery-could-save-the-brain/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; molecular biologist Pankaj Kapahi, from the Buck Institute. "Stored glycogen doesn't just sit there in the brain, it is involved in pathology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/insulin-isnt-just-made-by-the-pancreas-heres-another-location-few-know-about?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Insulin Isn't Just Made by The Pancreas. Here's Another Location Few Know About.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on links previously found between &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddu024"&gt;glycogen and neurodegeneration&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers spotted evidence of excessive glycogen levels both in tauopathy models created in fruit flies (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and in the brain cells of people with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis revealed a key mechanism at play: tau proteins interrupt the normal breakdown and use of glycogen in the brain, adding to the dangerous build-up of both tau and glycogen, as well as lowering protective neuron defense barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166553" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166553" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BrainScans-1.jpg" alt="Brain scans" class="wp-image-166553 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BrainScans-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BrainScans-1-554x415.jpg 554w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/BrainScans-1-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166553" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at the effects of a build-up of tau proteins and glycogen in fruit fly brains. Above are normal brains; below, brains with tauopathy show increased vacuole size, marked by arrows. (Bar et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucial to this interaction is the activity of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen_phosphorylase"&gt;glycogen phosphorylase&lt;/a&gt; or GlyP, the main enzyme tasked with turning glycogen into a fuel the body can use. When the researchers boosted GlyP production in fruit flies, glycogen stores were utilized once more, helping to fight back against cell damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By increasing GlyP activity, the brain cells could better detoxify harmful reactive oxygen species, thereby reducing damage and even extending the lifespan of tauopathy model flies," &lt;a href="https://www.buckinstitute.org/news/neurons-burn-sugar-differently-the-discovery-could-save-the-brain/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;Buck Institute &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;biologist Sudipta Bar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team wondered if a restricted diet – already associated with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0047-6374(01)00226-3"&gt;better brain health&lt;/a&gt; – would help. When fruit flies affected by tauopathy were put on a low-protein diet, they lived longer and showed reduced brain damage, suggesting that the metabolic shift prompted by dieting can help boost GlyP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a notable set of findings, not least because it suggests a way that glycogen and tau aggregation could be tackled in the brain. The researchers also developed a drug based around the 8-Br-cAMP molecule to mimic the effects of dietary restriction, which had similar effects on flies in experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work might even tie into research involving GLP-1 receptor agonists such as Ozempic, designed to manage  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="166540" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and reduce weight loss, but also now showing promise for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-loss-drugs-like-ozempic-may-guard-against-dementia-research-finds"&gt;protecting against dementia&lt;/a&gt;. That might be because these drugs interact with one of glycogen's pathways, the researchers suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By discovering how neurons manage sugar, we may have unearthed a novel therapeutic strategy: one that targets the cell's inner chemistry to fight age-related decline," &lt;a href="https://www.buckinstitute.org/news/neurons-burn-sugar-differently-the-discovery-could-save-the-brain/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Kapahi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we continue to age as a society, findings like these offer hope that better understanding – and perhaps rebalancing – our brain's hidden sugar code could unlock powerful tools for combating dementia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01314-w"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A piece of chewed birch bark tar gum unearthed in western Sweden has unlocked a window into ancient life, revealing the oldest known human DNA in the region. First excavated in the early 1990s from the &lt;strong&gt;Huseby Klev&lt;/strong&gt; site, this 10,000-year-old artifact was originally thought to be just another example of Stone Age tool-making material. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;But decades later, new DNA sequencing techniques have confirmed that this humble piece of prehistoric gum once passed through the mouths of three individuals — &lt;strong&gt;two women and one man&lt;/strong&gt; — providing genetic insights that were previously impossible to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Rare Genetic Snapshot From Ancient Scandinavia&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the early Mesolithic period, &lt;strong&gt;birch bark tar&lt;/strong&gt; was widely used by hunter-gatherer societies across Europe as an adhesive in tool production. But its secondary role as a chewing gum may have been just as common. Researchers now believe ancient people chewed the bark either during downtime or while working, leaving behind invaluable traces of their DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Human remains from this era in Scandinavia are exceedingly rare, and those that have been found usually contain poorly preserved genetic material. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-019-0399-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study published in Communications Biology&lt;/a&gt;, scientists at Stockholm University were finally able to unlock DNA hidden in the bark thanks to modern advancements. As researcher &lt;strong&gt;Anders Götherström&lt;/strong&gt; explained, “Much of our history is visible in the DNA we carry with us, so we try to look for DNA wherever we believe we can find it.”&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tracing Ancient Migrations through DNA&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When scientists analyzed the preserved chewed material, they discovered strong links between the three individuals and ancient populations from &lt;strong&gt;Ice Age Europe&lt;/strong&gt;. Interestingly, the tools found at the Huseby Klev site appear to have originated in Russia, offering dual evidence of prehistoric movement into Scandinavia from both the &lt;strong&gt;East European Plain&lt;/strong&gt; and Southern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings align with previous hypotheses about dual migration routes into the region. As &lt;strong&gt;Natalija Kashuba&lt;/strong&gt; of the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo put it, researchers were “really impressed that archaeologists took care during the excavations and preserved such fragile material.” She described the breakthrough as “almost forensic research,” as scientists sequenced DNA from “mastic lumps” that had been discarded 10,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Unlocking Ancient Lifestyles From Chewing Bark&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond migration patterns, this ancient gum has the potential to uncover intimate aspects of prehistoric life — including diet, health, and social structure. According to &lt;strong&gt;Per Persson&lt;/strong&gt;, also from the Museum of Cultural History in Oslo, “&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/05/traces-unknown-human-tibetan-dna/" data-type="post" data-id="91243"&gt;DNA &lt;/a&gt;from these ancient chewing gums have an enormous potential not only for tracing the origin and movement of peoples long time ago, but also for providing insights in their social relations, diseases, and food.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although birch bark tar chewing might not seem unusual given its documented use as glue, its role in preserving genetic history is now beyond question. The two casts of the bark, which clearly show distinct &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/07/komodo-dragons-iron-teeth-new-discovery/" data-type="post" data-id="7030"&gt;teeth &lt;/a&gt;marks, reveal a brief but intimate moment frozen in time — one that offers modern science a rare glimpse into the people who once inhabited early Scandinavia.&lt;/p&gt;

But now there is a surprising rapidly growing market for it: middle aged women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson still puts in his protein shake to “put on size,” Ivanka Trump revealed earlier this year she takes a dose with her morning smoothie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From fitness influencers on TikTok to health experts, the chalky powder is now being touted for a range of benefits for &lt;a href="/topic/women"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt;.

Creatine may also offer benefits tied to hormonal fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creatine can help ease fatigue during your period by supporting stable energy levels,” Rupar continued, “especially when you’re feeling more tired.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oestrogen and progesterone, &lt;a href="/topic/hormones"&gt;hormones&lt;/a&gt; that regulate the menstrual cycle, influence how the body produces and uses creatine, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During the menstrual cycle, creatine levels can change, and supplements may help keep energy and muscle function more stable, especially when oestrogen is low,” Rupar said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 fcVRZz"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/02/13/57/AdobeStock_499615526.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/02/13/57/AdobeStock_499615526.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/02/13/57/AdobeStock_499615526.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Creatine may help women support muscle strength, brain function, and energy levels" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-23363"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Creatine may help women support muscle strength, brain function, and energy levels&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt;

have breached the fluids that surround eggs and travel with sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team led by Dr. Emilio Gómez‑Sánchez of Next Fertility Murcia in Spain scanned &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/follicular-fluid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;follicular fluid&lt;/a&gt; from 29 women and seminal fluid from 22 men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts found microplastics in 69 percent of the women and 55 percent of the men they studied. According to Dr. Gómez‑Sánchez, the team was surprised to find that the particles were so widespread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-plastics-in-human-reproductive-fluids"&gt;Plastics in human reproductive fluids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study detected polymers such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/polytetrafluoroethylene" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polytetrafluoroethylene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://adrecoplastics.co.uk/polypropylene-uses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polypropylene&lt;/a&gt;, materials better known for slick frying pans and food packaging. Seeing them next to human eggs turns a theoretical hazard into a measurable one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2021, Italian obstetricians spotted twelve plastic fragments in every placenta they examined, confirming that particles smaller than five millimeters can cross the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33395930/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;maternal‑fetal boundary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly sized particles have been uncovered deep in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35364151/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lung tissue&lt;/a&gt; removed during surgery, proving that inhalation is a realistic delivery route for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/simple-way-to-remove-microplastics-from-tap-water-home-faucet/"&gt;plastic&lt;/a&gt; dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the Netherlands have even measured plastic mass circulating in human blood samples, an &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35367073/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;observation&lt;/a&gt; that explains how fragments migrate to distant tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-plastics-enter-the-human-body"&gt;How plastics enter the human body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people take in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-in-human-brains-may-affect-mental-health/"&gt;plastic&lt;/a&gt; flecks by eating, drinking, or breathing, because everyday products shed invisible dust whenever they are heated, abraded, or exposed to sunlight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once swallowed or inhaled, particles small enough can slip through the gut wall or the thin air‑blood membrane in the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies suggest that fragments under one micrometer can enter cells directly, whereas larger shards get trapped in tissue and spark local irritation. Either way, they bypass the body’s usual waste filters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory work on mice shows that digestive uptake rises when &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/airborne-microplastics-where-they-come-from-and-where-they-go/"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt; hitchhike on fats, a detail that matters for fertility research because reproductive hormones ride on similar lipid highways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overlap raises worry that plastics may act as endocrine mimics or carriers for other chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gómez‑Sánchez’s team avoided laboratory contamination by collecting every human sample in glass vials and verifying the absence of background plastic. This means the polymers they found were genuine residents, not stray lab dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-plastic-harms-fertility"&gt;Plastic harms fertility&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice exposed to polystyrene fragments shed sperm with damaged DNA and sluggish movement, effects traced to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31896473/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; that overwhelms antioxidant defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36948006/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; on rodent Leydig cells shows shriveled mitochondria after nanoplastic exposure, which throttles testosterone production and shrinks litter sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviews published in 2024 concluded that microplastics can disrupt the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38750730/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hypothalamic‑pituitary‑gonadal axis&lt;/a&gt;, leading to hormonal imbalances and faulty egg maturation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because human oocytes develop over months, chronic exposure could matter more than a short spike. That makes the repeated detection of PTFE in both eggs and sperm especially noteworthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-plastic-levels-in-eggs-and-sperm"&gt;Plastic levels in eggs and sperm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current data set, PTFE appeared in 31 percent of sampled egg fluid and 41 percent of semen. PP ranked second among women and &lt;a href="https://www.chemicalsafetyfacts.org/chemicals/polystyrene/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polystyrene&lt;/a&gt; second among men, with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/polyethylene-terephthalate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polyethylene terephthalate&lt;/a&gt; also present but in smaller numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annual plastic output has climbed from under two million tons in 1950 to about 460 million in 2019, a 230‑fold jump documented by the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36969097/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Minderoo‑Monaco Commission on Plastics and Human Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each uptick in production increases litter, weathering, and fragment release, tightening the feedback loop between plastics and people. Reproductive cells, delicate by design, stand on the front line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gómez‑Sánchez reported that most reproductive samples contained only one or two plastic particles, amounts considered low compared with overall debris in the fluids. Yet fertility specialists note that even trace metals can derail embryo development, so particle counts alone may not predict risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-fertility-research-must-include-plastics"&gt;Human fertility research must include plastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They should be considered an additional argument in favor of avoiding the generalized use of plastics in our daily lives,” said Professor Carlos Calhaz‑Jorge of the University of Lisbon. He also noted that further research is needed to prove causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team will now study hundreds of patients and link particle loads to embryo quality during &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22457-ivf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;in vitro fertilization cycles&lt;/a&gt;. Those correlations could supply the first direct human evidence beyond laboratory rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They plan lifestyle questionnaires to test whether habits such as heavy bottled‑water use or microwaving food in plastic correlate with higher particle counts. The approach could convert abstract exposure theory into personal advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Microplastics are just one variable in a complex equation,” said Dr. Gómez‑Sánchez. He urges moderation of plastic use rather than alarm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-simple-habits-to-lower-exposure"&gt;Simple habits to lower exposure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switching from plastic bottles to glass or stainless steel lowers ingestion because heat and time no longer leach particles from container walls. Replacing scratched nonstick pans can cut PTFE flakes in the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers advise skipping plastic cutting boards and using ceramic or bamboo instead, because knife action liberates shavings that cling to food. Letting take‑out cool before transferring it from polystyrene boxes also helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air purifiers with HEPA filters capture airborne fibers shed by synthetic textiles, a step especially useful for nurseries. Regular vacuuming with a sealed system keeps particles from resuspending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tweaks are not foolproof, yet they come with side benefits like removing chemical additives that ride on plastic dust. They buy time while science sorts out the clinical stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-efforts-to-cut-human-plastics-pollution"&gt;Efforts to cut human plastics pollution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public‑health researchers argue that personal choices alone cannot outrun a supply chain making more than a billion pounds of new plastic every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negotiators at the United Nations are hammering out a global treaty that could cap production and streamline recycling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/biology/people/faculty-directory/Phil-Landrigan.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Philip Landrigan&lt;/a&gt; of Boston College calls the treaty a once‑in‑a‑generation chance to protect human health, because curbing output remains the only sure way to slow microplastic fallout. He points to the emerging fertility data as evidence that time is short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether lawmakers act or not, the science of sub‑visible plastic is moving fast thanks to sharper imaging tools and nanomechanical sensors. Studies that once took months now finish in days, filling the literature with fresh clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every new dataset sharpens the same picture: plastics weather into dust, the dust goes everywhere, and living tissue keeps no closed doors. Eggs and sperm, it turns out, are no exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Human Reproduction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 15:32:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxQSWRTV19pTUZhQ3lMYWpNOFBpRUMxeUF1clV3eU1fbTRQTkw5VERGRjBtaTJ0enVSZHVINlNtVU82OG1OdzVqQjcxNzQzSFRQN2xfRi14MHRxSHNNUzJUcnF0NS1kNjV1U2V2VjhZczZ1QjM3R3RJLUlDMDlvZV9wSW5yUGpqOXE2UHI3enQ1dw</guid></item><item><title>自美国宣布消灭麻疹以来，麻疹病例激增至历史新高- CNN | Measles cases surge to record high since disease was declared eliminated in the US - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxOUVdZeGFjRGZLU0FFaU04Zk9MVXpSdWx2UWd2YlFrMlk1UGdaMmY2aGRlazM5eHRHSi01U2lVVzNkMmgwZzBuOEtISGVIZzU1ZXVObDQ2Y1dKU1UyR3RjYURNTzRzVjNlNWRMbFhfdFBHSTZ6SkFBeVZ3bjBKUXdfdm1QTlhRd9IBiwFBVV95cUxOTjZwRE94QXRPbk5CSWsyUWtYN3MzeGtnVEV4SlRzU1lubHhBYk5jT29tWXpDVkFSWmVQNmdvMGNWRzlNUWtWcWdiV2NsTXkxWUVaU0cxdmk4YkVQUUp0blNpMlFYRTRXTG5SdlJwSlNMNVA1T1hMQnM0VU9Xdm5wWFJvUTdTRkRSR204?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Falling childhood vaccine coverage and a large, smoldering outbreak that was kindled in an undervaccinated pocket of West Texas have driven the United States to a troubling new milestone: There have been more measles cases in the US this year than any other since the disease was declared eliminated a quarter-century ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn600043b6mvzj71np5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been at least 1,277 confirmed cases of measles reported in the US in 2025, according to &lt;a href="https://cori.centerforhealthsecurity.org/resources/measles-outbreak-response" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Outbreak Response Innovation. Just halfway through the year, the case tally has already surpassed the last record from 2019, when there were a total of 1,274 cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn600053b6mz9tcsdpg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say this year’s cases are likely to be severely undercounted because many are going unreported. Three people have died from measles this year – two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all of whom were unvaccinated – matching the total number of US measles deaths from the previous two and a half decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn600063b6m1x9vi8r9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, meaning there has not been continuous transmission for more than a year at a time. Reaching this status was “a historic public health achievement,” according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, possible in large part because of vaccine development. The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine that is most commonly used first became widely available in the US in the 1970s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn600073b6ml1mxlwsj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before this year, there have been an average of about 180 measles cases reported each year since the disease was declared eliminated, according to CDC data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn600083b6m59sk5tgf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-outbreak-new-york-2019-lessons-learned"&gt;large outbreaks in New York&lt;/a&gt; threatened elimination status; those outbreaks were concentrated in Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn and Rockland County that had been targeted with anti-vaccine disinformation for years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn600093b6m12z6cerq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This year, the vast majority of measles cases have been in Texas, with more than 750 confirmed cases associated with one outbreak that started in late January. If cases associated with that outbreak continue to accumulate through January of next year, the US could lose its measles elimination status.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclzqcig00043b6me94k1xsq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most of those cases – more than 400 since the start of the year – have been in Gaines County, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;the state health department&lt;/a&gt;, where vaccination rates are well below the recommended level. In the 2024-25 school year, nearly 1 in 4 kindergartners in Gaines County did not have their required MMR vaccine, one of the worst rates in the state.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000d3b6mr6rd7glk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dozens of cases in New Mexico and Oklahoma have also been linked to the West Texas outbreak, and cases reported in Kansas may also be connected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000e3b6mwlqq7hxx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Special &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/04/health/measles-wastewater-us-spread"&gt;vaccination clinics&lt;/a&gt; that have been stood up in response to the outbreak have led to additional coverage for thousands of people. Many of the affected counties have also introduced expanded vaccination guidance, allowing infants to get their first shot as early as 6 months old instead of waiting until 1 year. In New Mexico, nearly twice as many MMR vaccines have been administered this year than there were at this point last year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the state health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm9daul00033b6mxtsnbbg9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And a recent &lt;a href="https://www.truveta.com/blog/research/research-insights/2025-early-measles-vaccinations-in-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of health records by Truveta, a health-care data and analytics company, shows that early vaccination rates jumped among infants in Texas. MMR vaccination rates among 6-month-olds in Texas this year are more than eight times higher than they were in 2019, and in March and April, about 1 in 5 children who received their first measles shot in Texas had gotten it early, before their first birthday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000f3b6m83kjht4y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But as the pace of new cases associated with the West Texas outbreak has slowed, cases have continued to accumulate across the country. There have been at least 27  total outbreaks – defined as three or more related cases – and at least 38&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;states have reported at least one case this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000g3b6m38c8hbxs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cases rose quickly in Colorado last month when an out-of-state traveler flew while infectious, leading to multiple cases among passengers on the same plane, and others among people who were in the airport at the same time and broader community spread from those cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000h3b6mlz4c0a63@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other cases among Colorado residents were linked to travel to Chihuahua, Mexico, where there is also a large outbreak concentrated among the local Mennonite population. There is another large outbreak happening in Ontario, Canada, which was linked to multiple cases in Michigan. At least one person has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/06/health/measles-deaths-canada-mexico"&gt;died from measles&lt;/a&gt; this year in Canada, and there have been nine deaths in Mexico.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000i3b6muv2fb8p8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In April, Mexico issued a &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/992760/APV-EEUU-EEUU-CANADA-Sarampion_20250425_english.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; for people traveling to the US and Canada due to high measles case rates. The CDC has also stepped up its guidance for travelers, advising that anyone traveling internationally should be vaccinated with two doses of the MMR vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000j3b6mr0910te8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of cases in the US this year have been in people who are unvaccinated; only about 8% of confirmed cases have been in people who had received one or two doses of the MMR vaccine, according to the CDC. At least 155 people with measles – about 1 out of every 8 cases – have been hospitalized this year, CDC data shows, and 28% of cases have been in children younger than 5.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclui2a300003b6mukid62r6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The MMR vaccine is safe and extremely effective – one dose is 93% effective against measles, and two doses are 97% effective – but measles is one of the most highly transmissible diseases in the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclv0qgb00063b6mk2lk45wd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Department of Health and Human Services has set a &lt;a href="https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/vaccination/maintain-vaccination-coverage-level-2-doses-mmr-vaccine-children-kindergarten-iid-04" target="_blank"&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; that at least 95% of children in kindergarten will have gotten two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, a threshold necessary to help prevent outbreaks of the highly contagious disease. The US has now fallen short of that threshold for four years in a row.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclv0xzz00093b6mer3s8tyc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="http://cnn.com/2024/10/02/health/measles-vaccine-coverage-kindergarten-school-requirement/index.html"&gt;record share&lt;/a&gt; of US kindergartners had an exemption for required vaccinations in the 2023-24 school year, leaving more than 125,000 new schoolchildren without coverage for at least one state-mandated vaccine, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html?ldkjfdl" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published by the CDC in October.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000k3b6mtrrkcpf9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the measles case count reached its previous record in 2019 – under the first Trump administration – both the HHS secretary and CDC director at the time released statements emphasizing the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine and encouraging Americans to get vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcly58zc000j3b6mywfz9cp0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the CDC still&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;does not have a director, and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/12/politics/rfk-jrs-long-complicated-history-with-the-measles-vaccines"&gt;long and complicated history&lt;/a&gt; with measles vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmclu6mn6000l3b6mxl0cirjl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In April, when there had been about 600 measles cases in the US, Kennedy made his strongest endorsement of vaccination yet – but it stood in stark contrast to years of work against measles vaccines. And last month, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisers-removed"&gt;dismissed an expert panel of vaccine advisers&lt;/a&gt; that has historically guided the federal government’s vaccine recommendations, a move that concerned public health officials across the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “With an ongoing measles outbreak and routine child vaccination rates declining, this move will further fuel the spread of vaccine-preventable illnesses,” Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, said in a statement at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

of wireless technology.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;If you thought you were tech savvy enough to know what the 'G' in 5G stands for, chances are you're wrong (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;But the G in 3G, 4G and of course, 5G all stand for 'generation' (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A quick glimpse across social media proves that many people believe this is the case for all the data speeds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The higher the number next to the G, the better the data, making 5G better than the earlier versions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent post on X, formerly Twitter, by &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://x.com/mtnug/status/1904171355169226835"&gt;MTN Uganda &lt;/a&gt;- the largest telecom company in the country asked people 'without Googling, what does the “G” in 4G and 5G stand for? A) Generation B) Gigabyte C) Google D) Grid.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;X users were quick to respond with a lot guessing gigabyte wrongly. Others offered their own guesses including 'generator', 'God' and 'greed'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/sciencetech/article-14247371/Cellphone-radiation-warning-researchers-reveal-new-risk-factor-5G-networks.html"&gt;5G wireless&lt;/a&gt; is now commonly used for smartphones and is better than the other generations at connecting to multiple devices at once. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But - adding another convoluted layer - 10G is not necessarily faster than 5G.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because the two Gs represent different concepts and therefore are not evenly comparable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The evolution of the G system started in 1980 with the invention of the mobile phone which allowed for analogue data to be transmitted via phone calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Digital came into play in 1991 with 2G and SMS and MMS capabilities were launched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An aerial view of a cellular tower stands on the top of a hill in Larkspur, California&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The higher the number next to the G, the better the data, making 5G better than the earlier versions. A file photo of a woman on her phone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then, the capabilities and carrying capacity for the mobile network has increased massively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More data can be transferred from one point to another via the mobile network quicker than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;5G debuted in South Korea in April 2019. During the Covid pandemic, US researchers investigated&lt;span&gt; the effects of radio-frequency radiation generated by the ultra-fast mobile internet and revealed that it had negligible health impacts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/sciencetech/article-8510939/Scientific-study-confirms-5G-harmless-benign.html"&gt;The study &lt;/a&gt;came after several 5G masts were vandalized during lockdowns following unfounded conspiracy theories saying the form of wireless communication caused Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Theorists claimed the fifth-generation wireless standard emitted radiation that lowers the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite providing essential communications technology during the pandemic, 5G masts were subject to arson attacks throughout the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In their research paper, published in PLOS ONE, the team wrote that the potential for health effects from higher radio-frequency radiation should be examined as concerns 'over their potential health impacts are ongoing'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To learn more, researchers conducted experiments using embryonic zebrafish, an organism often used to discover interactions between potential environmental stressors and biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Adult zebrafish in the lab. Around 70 per cent of human genes are found in zebrafish, according to scientists, which makes them well suited as lab models&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The experimental set up used in the experiments for the study.

Redweik had picked up a fungal infection, probably during a visit to Vancouver Island in mid-2016, and there was little doubt he now was near death: He was crashing into walls when he tried to walk and vomiting frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="E2CX37KMZ5CNRP3ZJOUANA52OI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“He was probably within a day or two of dying when he got to the hospital,” said Redweik’s wife, Joyce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D7OIGH5VHNFW3GA6SSOLYE3XSA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Redweik was hospitalized from August to October while doctors blasted the fungus in his system with amphotericin. He&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;lost his hearing and went blind in one eye from the pressure of swelling on critical nerves. His kidneys were damaged by the medication. He couldn’t walk or even swallow, receiving nutrition through a feeding tube in his nose. A former competitive weightlifter, Redweik, who was 58 years old at the time, lost 63 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="REY2LD7PBBCNDFNH2SU67ZJSRE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But after six weeks, the amphotericin seemed to have killed the fungus. Laboratory cultures of Redweik’s spinal fluid began to run clear. He started relearning how to walk, swallow and take care of himself. On Oct. 17, he went home to continue recuperating, and a few weeks later, he attended his daughter’s wedding, even walking a few steps down the aisle with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SQ3T5C3EKJASLCRNQ6SWCFYCLU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Four days later, though, while sitting on a couch at his home in Arizona, Redweik passed out. At a Tucson hospital, he complained of pain in his eye sockets. The pressure in his brain had soared, and a surgeon there installed a shunt in his head that routed the excess cerebrospinal fluid into his abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6QNC3DD4MRB4HE6VMEUJ4XQ3IU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But soon, his ability to walk regressed and he lapsed into near-unconsciousness. More amphotericin seemed like the only choice. Yet cultures of his spinal fluid showed definitively the fungus was dead. What good would another round of “amphoterrible” do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="R6IVR2V5Y5G7JNIUMO3HEIFJUQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Stumped by Redweik’s continuing severe illness, his doctor tracked down a specialist in fungal diseases at the National Institutes of Health who said he knew of cases like Redweik’s. Peter Williamson, chief of the translational mycology section at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had a hunch about how to treat Redweik. But Redweik needed to come to the NIH’s clinical center, the research hospital for severely ill patients where Williamson worked. Only then was Redweik’s condition identified and treated, saving his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="Q4O4VGT3RJB2JO7XRMCEZ2HRTA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="Q4O4VGT3RJB2JO7XRMCEZ2HRTA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Unbearable headaches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P23MVOZXYJBOPL4QQBNM7XOTNE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When his crushing headaches began in the spring of 2017, Redweik gobbled over-the-counter painkillers and eventually visited the emergency room near his Green Valley, Arizona, home. There he received a common diagnosis for people in hot, dry climates: dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JDNPEEX4EZEDNKQKMQ46PZ73QQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He and Joyce didn’t believe it. Redweik had once developed a blood clot in his calf, and they were concerned he had another in his head. They wanted an MRI, but the wait to see a neurologist was four to six months, and Redweik was starting a new job in Plano, Texas, leaving ahead of Joyce, who would join him later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YVDNFBJTFJDH7FHYSQJKQKMARY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There, his condition worsened. The headaches were nearly unbearable and had spread down his neck. He began throwing up two or three times a day, and his gait was unsteady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BKSCEW3SMZA7FOWJBSNPL4TYCU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It was like I was intoxicated,” Redweik recalled. “I couldn’t walk steadily. I was hoping people weren’t watching. It was like I was going to work drunk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J3KVVXRQNBFKDFWB5Q7KS33BII" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;During a visit a few weeks later, Joyce Redweik found her husband confused and disoriented. By August, Peter Redweik was falling down when he tried to walk. He needed a wheelchair. He finally got in to see a neurologist and had an MRI exam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MHEHYRMULZEDBI6JBPF5B3UCYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There was no blood clot. But given his condition, Redweik was admitted to the hospital, where tests revealed &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000642.htm" target="_blank"&gt;cryptococcal meningitis&lt;/a&gt;, which, left untreated, can be fatal. He began therapy with amphotericin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TVOMLTWLIJA2VE3JJS2EZ2P6ZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Redweiks had spent their adult lives in the deserts of Arizona and Nevada, so it was unusual that Peter was infected by a fungus, &lt;i&gt;Cryptococcus gattii&lt;/i&gt;, that thrives in a wet, temperate, forested climate. But they had visited Vancouver Island, which had such a climate, the year before, so perhaps that was where Peter was exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4AXBY2J2GBGHRCIXZZGAMRZUXQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;With dangerous pressure building up in his brain, Redweik endured painful lumbar punctures to drain cerebrospinal fluid every few days. Eventually, that procedure was replaced by a lumbar drain installed in his lower back that siphoned off the fluid when the pressure grew too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XWTLF3YMWREUXCCYND7WVUMQXI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After six weeks, laboratory cultures of Redweik’s spinal fluid were negative.

With the development of powerful medications to control HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, very few cases now occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KFIP3PO5LNHZXLGNGA6GHWGHXM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;According to the NIH’s Williamson, only about 3,000 people are infected by the cryptococcus fungus each year. About 1,000 are HIV patients, another 1,000 are people with suppressed immune systems such as transplant recipients, and 1,000 are previously healthy people like Redweik. About a third of the 3,000 die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CFBJSDMU5FDMFFPDDOTWDRQHOQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When Redweik collapsed on his couch and was taken to the hospital again with what seemed like a relapse, his doctors were puzzled. Lab cultures of his spinal fluid showed no evidence of live fungus, but he still showed symptoms of severe meningitis. One test might be wrong, but not several. Should they ignore the results and try to kill the fungus again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VJGVXO3OCNHELPFP423TMWDRUA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a search for that answer, one of Redweik’s physicians found Williamson’s name online and contacted him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7J6WTGD7JRC3HKEKALVKB7EBEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;According to Williamson, a subset of the previously healthy patients suffer an autoimmune reaction after the fungus is killed: a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4825797/" target="_blank"&gt;post-infectious inflammatory response syndrome, or PIIRS.&lt;/a&gt; It is not unlike the inflammatory response that has produced long covid in some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I7K2QRO56NFDLPJSPSVDRM6I2E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Williamson was confident that Redweik was one of those patients and his immune system still considered the fungus a threat. It had amped up the various cells that attack invaders, focusing on tiny particles of the fungus — proteins it had released and cell walls that still remained in Redweik’s system after the cryptococcus was vanquished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WS7AO25C7NEBNIW6QWQRPNAGSU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That is what unleashed another round of inflammation and the new symptoms, Williamson theorized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D6OBDNYWQFFATH6BV5FDAH6U4M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Redweik was declining quickly when he arrived at the NIH, and Williamson put him on large doses of the steroid methylprednisolone to suppress the immune response, along with the antifungal fluconazole in case the cryptococcus fungus somehow flourished again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RD77MX2R5REUVNBM6HNZPIW5SY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It may be that microscopic particles of the fungus were still in Redweik’s brain, triggering swelling and pressure akin to his meningitis as the immune system attacked, according to Williamson. Or perhaps antibodies were able to travel to areas of the brain and produce generalized inflammation, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GU2UBA56SZAFTJXO2H2JBJWIK4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It is so counterintuitive,” Williamson said. Doctors “treat again with amphotericin because they don’t know.” But “it’s the delay in diagnosis and the inflammatory response that kills you,” he said. “It’s the edema [swelling] that kills you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LAZGJSZ5IJDOJELFF4IPRZPL5U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;about three days, Redweik began to respond to the steroids and his symptoms started to fade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZMZUAIQBWBEJFCCSODN7KNYZJU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The technology available at the NIH hospital for monitoring his immune response was critical to saving him, Williamson said. Advanced flow cytometry allowed doctors to rapidly identify the immune cells in Redweik’s spinal fluid and confirm Williamson’s diagnosis that he was suffering an immune response to the dead fungus, not a recurrence of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M4LZXT4UYZFGPK5AU6UZPUMR4Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After three weeks at the NIH, Redweik went through rehab again and returned home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XJ44QXS63VGJNEFKO4VKUROSYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Today he still has difficulty hearing, he remains blind in his right eye, and his legs are numb below the knees, he said. With Stage 3 kidney disease caused by the amphotericin, he may one day need dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LRYYZQIYRZESXBI2TWPDBPPG3E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But even with those deficits, Redweik has regained his weight and resumed the retired life he and Joyce had planned.

But this seemed to be something that could work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Worthingtons set up &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-the-worthington-fertility-fight?attribution_id=sl:a08e9ce2-63d5-4f75-a760-0b37d9a68ac8&amp;amp;lang=en_US&amp;amp;ts=1749573367&amp;amp;utm_campaign=man_sharesheet_dash&amp;amp;utm_content=amp13_c-amp14_t1-amp15_t3&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=copy_link&amp;amp;v=amp14_t1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;an account on GoFundMe*&lt;/a&gt;, originally asking for $8,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are not alone. Between 2011 and 2015, 1,602 GoFundMe campaigns were created specifically to raise funds for IVF treatments. GoFundMe reports that more than $3 million has been raised for these campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although GoFundMe does not publicize a listing of IVF campaigns by state, the company confirmed that couples in Payson, Springville and American Fork have also created campaigns to raise funds for IVF treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;I want to be able to provide that amazing life-growing experience, but I want to accomplish this before we turn 40.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Megan Worthington&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is understandable, given the costs. The average cost for one IVF round of treatment in the U.S. is between $15,000 and $30,000, according to the Stanford for Economic Policy Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurance rarely covers the cost of any fertility treatments, meaning that unless a couple has an extra tens of thousands of dollars available to them, they have to find ways to raise the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes IVF even more difficult to handle for many women is not only the cost of the treatment, but also the fact that there is no guarantee that they will have a baby in the end. In other words, a couple may go through the various rounds of treatments — creating embryos outside of the woman's body and placing them in the uterus — without a guaranteed formation of a fetus that will lead to a baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pew Research Center continues to report that the number of women who use IVF services continues to increase, despite the costs, which also continue to rise. The organization states that one out of every 10 women in the United States between the ages of 15 and 44 has received some form of fertility assistance, including advice, referrals and medical procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Pew and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have investigated the connection between women having children later in life and the growing use of fertility treatments. What researchers do know is that one of every 42 babies born in the U.S. is a product of IVF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking fertility treatments can also be a struggle in a state like Utah, where families have more children than the national average. Women like Worthington, and others in Utah seeking IVF treatments, have found the entire endeavor frustrating, sometimes causing questions of self-worth and more. They often feel misunderstood by others, including some family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this to say, this process for couples can be exhausting emotionally and for the women, physically, as well. Having friends and family who support the couple is important, as well as considering other ways to parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I really want to be able to give my husband not just the experience of being a father and watching his child grow up, but also the different growth stages of pregnancy from hearing the first heartbeat, to the first kick and alien belly roll," Worthington wrote on the GoFundMe page. "I want to be able to provide that amazing life-growing experience, but I want to accomplish this before we turn 40."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worthington has a 13-year-old daughter from a previous relationship and has witnessed her husband loving the girl as his own. They have also considered adopting a child through the foster system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They want to be parents. And even though the path to get there has been a struggle, they know it will happen somehow. For now, they'll focus on raising the money and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think I can only go through this until I'm 40," Worthington said. "We'll keep trying until then. My sisters-in-law have been really supportive and they've come up with things like having a garage sale. And I think the GoFundMe campaign can be very useful. This was a last-minute decision we made a month ago. This whole thing has been a roller coaster."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*KSL.com does not assure that the money deposited into the account will be applied for the benefit of the persons named as beneficiaries.

"Just standing or walking after a meal can lower your blood sugar by up to 30%. Yes, it's that powerful." And no, you don't need to go for long walks. Ruchi recommends just a short stroll.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In fact, a 2022 &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/17034/#:~:text=Just%202%20minutes%20of%20walking%20after%20eating%20can%20help%20blood,It%20helps%2C%20too." data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in Sports Medicine found that walking for just 2 to 5 minutes after a meal can significantly improve blood sugar levels. Even simply standing helps, though walking remains more effective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Don't have time to walk after meals? Or stuck at a desk job that keeps you sedentary?" Ruchi offers a clever alternative: calf raises. "You can do them while brushing your teeth, sitting at your desk, or waiting for your food to heat up," she says. These small movements activate your lower leg muscles, especially the soleus, a powerful muscle that plays a big role in blood sugar regulation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why does this matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When your &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/blood-sugar" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="blood sugar"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; is stable, insulin stays balanced and your body stays in fat-burning mode," Ruchi explains. "But when insulin spikes, your body stops burning fat. And over time, needing more and more insulin to do the same job can make weight loss even harder." That's why Ruchi emphasises the power of small, consistent habits. "Little changes like this may not seem like much, but they can lead to big results over time."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Unlike in your bones, having calcium in your coronary arteries is a bad thing, because it indicates the buildup of plaque comprised of cholesterol, fat, and other lovely things. The higher the calcium score, the more plaque that has built up — and with it, &lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/blog/articles/2021/oct/calcium-score-what-is-a-cac-test-do-i-need-one/#:~:text=Wait%2C%20isn%E2%80%99t%20calcium%20a,future%20heart%20attack%20or%20stroke."&gt;the higher the risk&lt;/a&gt; of heart disease and even heart attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A couple of hours after the test, I received a ping on my phone. My CAC score was 7, which indicated the presence of a small amount of calcified plaque, &lt;a href="https://www.droracle.ai/articles/21304/agatston-score-how-to-interprete"&gt;which translates&lt;/a&gt; to a “low but non-zero cardiovascular risk.” Put another way, &lt;a href="https://internal.mesa-nhlbi.org/about/procedures/tools/mesa-score-risk-calculator"&gt;according to one calculator&lt;/a&gt;, it means an approximately 2.1 percent chance of a major adverse cardiovascular event over the next 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;2.1 percent doesn’t &lt;em&gt;sound &lt;/em&gt;high — it’s a &lt;a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/data-science/a-priori-probability/"&gt;little higher&lt;/a&gt; than the chance of pulling an ace of spades from a card deck — but when it comes to major adverse cardiovascular events, 2.1 percent is approximately 100 percent higher than I’d like. That’s how I found myself joining the &lt;a href="https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/articles/do-statins-save-lives-doctors-dont-agree"&gt;tens of millions of Americans&lt;/a&gt; who are currently on statin drugs, which lower levels of LDL cholesterol (aka the “bad” cholesterol). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I didn’t really want to celebrate my birthday with a numerical reminder of my creeping mortality. But everything about my experience — from the high-tech calcium scan to my doctor’s aggressive statin prescription — explains how the US has made amazing progress against one of our biggest health risks: heart disease, and especially, heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="a-dramatic-drop-in-heart-attack-deaths" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;A dramatic drop in heart attack deaths&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A heart attack — which usually occurs when atherosclerotic plaque partially or fully blocks the flow of blood to the heart — used to be close to a death sentence. In 1963, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_20/sr20_002acc.pdf"&gt;death rate from coronary heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, which includes heart attacks, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4830a1.htm"&gt;peaked&lt;/a&gt; in the US, with 290 deaths per 100,000 population. As late as 1970, a man over 65 who was hospitalized with a heart attack &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/06/heart-attack.html?ck_subscriber_id=2771385781&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Heart+attacks+no+longer+leading+cause+of+US+deaths+-+18114390&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=convertkit"&gt;had only a 60 percent chance&lt;/a&gt; of ever leaving that hospital alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A sudden cardiac death is the disease equivalent of homicide or a car crash death. It meant someone’s father or husband, wife or mother, was suddenly ripped away without warning. Heart attacks were &lt;em&gt;terrifying&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yet today, that risk is much less. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.038644"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;, the proportion of all deaths attributable to heart attacks plummeted by nearly 90 percent between 1970 and 2022. Over the same period, heart disease as a cause of all adult deaths in the US fell from 41 percent to 24 percent. Today, if a man over 65 is hospitalized with a heart attack, he has a 90 percent chance of leaving the hospital alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;By my calculations, the improvements in preventing and treating heart attacks between 1970 and 2022 have likely saved tens of millions of lives. So how did we get here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In 1964, the year after the coronary heart disease death rate peaked, the US surgeon general released a &lt;a href="https://digirepo.nlm.nih.gov/ext/document/101584932X202/PDF/101584932X202.pdf"&gt;landmark report&lt;/a&gt; on the risks of smoking. It marked the start of a decades-long public health campaign against one of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/about/cigarettes-and-cardiovascular-disease.html"&gt;biggest contributing factors to cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That campaign has been incredibly successful. In 1970, an estimated 40 percent of Americans smoked. By 2019, that percentage had fallen to 14 percent, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/smoking.htm"&gt;it keeps declining&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The reduction in smoking has helped lower the number of Americans at risk of a heart attack. So did the development and spread in the 1980s of statins like I’m on now, which make it far easier to manage cholesterol and prevent heart disease. By one estimate, statins &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X%2821%2900572-6/fulltext"&gt;save&lt;/a&gt; nearly 2 million lives globally each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When heart attacks do occur, the widespread adoption of CPR and the development of portable defibrillators — which only began to become &lt;a href="https://www.aedleader.com/blog/history-of-aeds/#:~:text=The%20First%20Portable%20Defibrillators%20in,in%20UK%20ambulances%20until%201990."&gt;common in the late 1960s&lt;/a&gt; — ensured that more people survived long enough to make it to the hospital. Once there, the development of specialized coronary care units, balloon angioplasty and artery-opening stents made it easier for doctors to rescue a patient suffering an acute cardiac event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="our-changing-heart-health-deaths" class="_7ka5u2 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h3 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Our changing heart health deaths&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Despite this progress in stopping heart attacks, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.html"&gt;around 700,000 Americans&lt;/a&gt; still die of all forms of heart disease every year, equivalent to 1 in 5 deaths overall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some of this is the unintended result of our medical success. As more patients survive acute heart attacks and &lt;a href="https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/u-s-life-expectancy-compare-countries/"&gt;life expectancy has risen as a whole&lt;/a&gt;, it means more people are living long enough to become vulnerable to other, more chronic forms of heart disease, like heart failure and pulmonary-related heart conditions. While the decline in smoking has reduced a major risk factor for heart disease, Americans are in many other ways much less healthy than they were 50 years ago. The increasing prevalence of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/php/data-research/index.html"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/hypertension.htm"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2731178"&gt;sedentary behavior&lt;/a&gt; all raise the risk that more Americans will develop some form of potentially fatal heart disease down the line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here, GLP-1 inhibitors like Ozempic hold amazing potential to reduce heart disease’s toll. &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/major-cvd-event-risk-cut-by-20-in-adults-without-diabetes-with-overweight-or-obesity"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; found that obese or overweight patients who took a GLP-1 inhibitor for more than three years had a 20 percent lower risk of heart attack, stroke, or death due to cardiovascular disease. Statins have saved millions of lives, yet &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/127172/cdc_127172_DS1.pdf"&gt;tens of millions more Americans&lt;/a&gt; could likely benefit from taking the cholesterol-lowering drugs, especially &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2019/08/19/why-do-women-get-cholesterol-lowering-statins-less-frequently-than-men"&gt;women, minorities, and people in rural areas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Lastly, far more Americans could benefit from the kind of advanced screening I received. Only &lt;a href="https://rcastoragev2.blob.core.windows.net/3c9c26e329cc22b38adf73d92e6f530f/PMC8105517.pdf"&gt;about 1.5 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; received a CAC test in 2017, but clinical guidelines indicate that &lt;a href="https://www.journalofcardiovascularct.com/article/S1934-5925%2816%2930285-4/fulltext"&gt;more than 30 million people&lt;/a&gt; could benefit from such scans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Just as it is with cancer, getting ahead of heart disease is the best way to stay healthy. It’s an astounding accomplishment to have reduced deaths from heart attacks by 90 percent over the past 50-plus years. But even better would be preventing more of us from ever getting to the cardiac brink at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter. &lt;a href="/pages/good-news-newsletter-signup"&gt;Sign up here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOTXB2a0FseURhbDdCWEpEbVJzNjJQY3ZSRzAxaDJiTjFmYzNlcGJ0SWJTbUM0czR6QnJFUTJfMUN2RkRVcjA2VmdOSnhzcHlQZk5GSWZaazlUaFZqYU1yQkdBNzI3N2NvV2RZZXNLM1BjanBzMkZEcU9nNzRuY1hzSE9adE9GRDFreUZsbV9PSk1mVHlsV2E3MWlaQm12TldJdDV2TA</guid></item><item><title>空气污染与肺癌相关的DNA突变“密切相关” - ScienceAlert | Air Pollution 'Strongly Associated' With DNA Mutations Tied to Lung Cancer - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxOTXQ0bHBSbFNIZGc0ekJid2p1SV9sSENfOTdjWmlzei0zUFZFekxKOGlGTDlvZTRXVU9oajYxa3ZoeE1Zb3RfRlNUdTZUSGRGWUJQaHlER2xiM3pJN05SSG15YXd5T1RkQ2lzdkdHRm9weWZsMmE0alhBZ09YQkdIRWJ3bWttX0JTVFBTelJXaTdKZWxuT1ZGNnJkaGlmbm5NSGJv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lung cancer cases are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lung-cancer-is-rising-in-non-smokers-and-this-could-be-why"&gt;&lt;span&gt;on the rise in non-smokers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; around the world, and air pollution could be an insidious, contributing factor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A genome study has now found that outdoor smog and soot are strongly associated with DNA mutations related to lung cancer – including known drivers seen in smokers, and new ones unique to non-smokers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The more pollution someone was exposed to, the more mutations scientists found in their lung tumors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The findings don't mean that air pollution is directly causing lung cancer, but they &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-3-years-of-air-pollution-can-increase-lung-cancer-risk-study-warns"&gt;do contribute to evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that possibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-how-lung-cancer-might-get-started-in-people-who-have-never-smoked?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Geneticists Just Got Closer to The Sources of Lung Cancer in People Who Never Smoked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We're seeing this problematic trend that never-smokers are increasingly getting lung cancer, but we haven't understood why," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/air-pollution-may-contribute-to-development-of-lung-cancer-in-never-smokers-new-study-finds"&gt;&lt;span&gt;explains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; biomolecular scientist Ludmil Alexandrov from the University of California San Diego (UCSD). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our research shows that air pollution is strongly associated with the same types of DNA mutations we typically associate with smoking."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The extensive international analysis examined the cancer genomes of 871 individuals from four continents, all of whom had lung cancer despite never having smoked and who had not yet received cancer treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those who lived in regions with high levels of air pollution were significantly more likely to have TP53 mutations, EGFR mutations, and shorter telomeres.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Abnormal TP53 and EGFR genes are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2011/583929"&gt;&lt;span&gt;hallmarks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of lung cancers, especially those driven by the SBS4 DNA mutation, and shorter telomeres are linked to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-long-could-the-human-lifespan-get-the-answer-may-surprise-you"&gt;accelerated aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the current study, non-smokers who lived in areas with higher air pollution were nearly four times more likely to exhibit SBS4 signatures as those who lived in regions with cleaner air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By contrast, exposure to secondhand smoke, which is a known cancer risk, showed only a slight increase in genetic mutations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"If there is a mutagenic effect of secondhand smoke, it may be too weak for our current tools to detect," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/air-pollution-may-contribute-to-development-of-lung-cancer-in-never-smokers-new-study-finds"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; geneticist Tongwu Zhang from the US National Cancer Institute (NCI).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not so for air pollution or tobacco smoking: both were strongly linked to DNA mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today in the United States, people who have never smoked or who have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lives make up &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lung-cancer/nonsmokers/index.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;about 10 to 20 percent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of lung cancer cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists have long suspected that air pollution could be a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/air-pollution-isnt-only-bad-for-lungs-say-studies-its-also-bad-for-mental-health"&gt;&lt;span&gt;contributing factor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, but exactly how fine particulate matter in the air compares to tobacco smoking or secondhand smoke exposure remains unclear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some studies suggest that breathing polluted air is on par with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/air-pollution-can-be-as-bad-for-lung-disease-as-a-pack-of-cigarettes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;smoking a pack a day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and yet these conclusions are mostly based on observational analyses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The current study digs further by looking at some of the molecular mechanisms that may be at play. It compared the lung cancer genomes of the 871 non-smokers with tumors from 345 smokers, to find similarities and differences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The majority of non-smokers with lung cancer had adenocarcinomas (the most common type of lung cancer), and nearly 5 percent of those tumors showed the SBS4 mutational signature. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, 28 percent of non-smokers showed a new signature called SBS40a, which wasn't found in t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;obacco smokers. Strangely, the cause of this particular mutational driver was unknown, but doesn't seem to be environmental in nature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We see it in a majority of cases in this study, but we don't yet know what's driving it," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/air-pollution-may-contribute-to-development-of-lung-cancer-in-never-smokers-new-study-finds"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Alexandrov. "This is something entirely different, and it opens up a whole new area of investigation."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The current research relied only on regional air pollution levels, which means it can't say how much any one individual was directly exposed to fine particulate matter in the air. Participants who said they had never smoked may have also smoked more than reported.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These limitations notwithstanding, the overall findings align with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-think-theyve-solved-the-enigma-of-how-air-pollution-causes-lung-cancer"&gt;&lt;span&gt;other evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; indicating that soot or smog may trigger tumor growth in a similar way to cigarette chemicals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This is an urgent and growing global problem that we are working to understand regarding never-smokers," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/air-pollution-may-contribute-to-development-of-lung-cancer-in-never-smokers-new-study-finds"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; epidemiologist Maria Teresa Landi from the NCI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team now hopes to expand their study to include cancer genomes from a more diverse, global cohort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09219-0"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="204" data-end="561"&gt;If you’ve ever found yourself asking your cat whether she slept well or telling your dog he’s a “good colleague” while you both work from home, you’re in crowded company. Psychologists call the tendency to treat animals as if they possess human minds anthropomorphism. Far from being flaky, that impulse reveals a cluster of hard‑won emotional skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="563" data-end="965"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6826447/"&gt;Well‑designed studies&lt;/a&gt; show that anthropomorphism is tied to stronger social bonds, richer imagination, and even measurable biochemical changes such as lower cortisol and higher oxytocin when people interact with their pets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="563" data-end="965"&gt;Below are seven emotional strengths that research consistently links to people who chat with Rover as if he actually understands every word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="972" data-end="1021"&gt;1. Heightened empathy and perspective‑taking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1023" data-end="1679"&gt;Imagining an inner world for an animal forces you to practice walking in “someone” else’s shoes—literally a different species. A 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1391606/full"&gt;Frontiers in Psychology paper&lt;/a&gt; found that attachment to pets mediates a positive relationship between animal empathy and prosocial attitudes toward humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1023" data-end="1679"&gt;In plain English: the same neural wiring that lets you wonder whether your dog is bored also fires when you wonder how a colleague feels. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9597799/"&gt;Meta‑analyses&lt;/a&gt; of anthropomorphism confirm that this habit of mind sharpens our ability to attribute emotions accurately to both animals and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1681" data-end="1895"&gt;Over time, that reflexive perspective‑taking shows up as warm curiosity in friendships, quicker recognition of non‑verbal cues, and a reputation for being the person who “just gets it” without lengthy explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1902" data-end="1952"&gt;2. Superior emotional regulation under stress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1954" data-end="2452"&gt;Talking aloud to a pet is a form of co‑regulation: you borrow the animal’s calm presence while narrating your own feelings. &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-friend-who-keeps-you-young"&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt; highlights how simply stroking a dog reduces the stress hormone cortisol while boosting oxytocin, the same bonding hormone that quiets infants .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1954" data-end="2452"&gt;Because language labels emotion, giving voice to worries (“Buddy, I’ve had a chaotic day!”) helps the prefrontal cortex down‑regulate the amygdala’s alarm bells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2454" data-end="2680"&gt;People who habitually vent to their pets therefore practice a neurological loop of name it → calm it → re‑engage, which translates to quicker recovery from workplace friction and fewer sleepless 3 a.m. rumination sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2687" data-end="2728"&gt;3. Creative and imaginative thinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2730" data-end="3315"&gt;Anthropomorphism requires mental flexibility: you are, in effect, writing mini fiction scenes every time you ask your rabbit whether she prefers kale or carrot. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6243028/"&gt;Developmental psychologists note&lt;/a&gt; a positive link between children’s pretend role‑play and their tendency to attribute minds to non‑human agents &lt;span class="" data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"&gt;&lt;a class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[9px] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6243028/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"&gt;&lt;span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden"&gt;&lt;span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center"&gt;pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Adults don’t lose that benefit; the 2018 &lt;em data-start="3119" data-end="3144"&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/em&gt; review on the “development of anthropomorphism” argues that the practice keeps the imagination muscles supple across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3317" data-end="3619"&gt;Creativity researchers describe anthropomorphic thinking as a low‑stakes sandbox for hypothesis testing: “What would a terrier CEO decide in this situation?” Those who keep that sandbox open often score higher on divergent‑thinking tasks and report an easier time brainstorming novel solutions at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3626" data-end="3681"&gt;4. Nurturing attachment style and care orientation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3683" data-end="4178"&gt;People who converse with pets display what attachment theorists call a secure base script—they assume their companion is available, responsive, and worthy of care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3683" data-end="4178"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8614365"&gt;Reviews&lt;/a&gt; of the human–animal bond suggest that anthropomorphic language often reinforces healthy caregiving behaviors and a nurturing self‑identity .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3683" data-end="4178"&gt; That attitude spills over: partners of devoted pet‑talkers report more supportive listening and practical kindness in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4180" data-end="4419"&gt;Importantly, the emotional strength here isn’t just kindness but consistency—the daily ritual of greeting the cat after work trains the nervous system for predictable caregiving routines, a key ingredient in building trust with humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4426" data-end="4466"&gt;5. Healthy self‑compassion dialogue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4468" data-end="4956"&gt;Listen closely and you’ll notice the words you choose for your pet are gentle, forgiving, and even playful—exactly the tone most of us struggle to use in our internal monologue. Therapists sometimes invite clients to “speak to yourself the way you speak to your dog.” &lt;a href="https://www.thementalwellnesscenter.com/new-blog/2023/10/31/speak-to-yourself-like-you-speak-to-your-dog-a-lesson-in-self-compassion"&gt;Emerging research supports&lt;/a&gt; the idea: a 2023 commentary on self‑compassion notes that mirroring pet‑directed speech can soften harsh self‑criticism and increase self‑acceptance &lt;span class="" data-state="closed"&gt;&lt;span class="ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]"&gt;&lt;a class="flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[9px] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out" href="https://www.thementalwellnesscenter.com/new-blog/2023/10/31/speak-to-yourself-like-you-speak-to-your-dog-a-lesson-in-self-compassion?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class="relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center"&gt;&lt;span class="flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden"&gt;&lt;span class="max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center"&gt;thementalwellnesscenter.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4958" data-end="5272"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10163869/"&gt;separate study&lt;/a&gt; of nurses found that pet ownership predicted higher self‑compassion scores, suggesting the spill‑over effect isn’t merely theoretical. People who chat warmly to their pets rehearse that same warmth internally, buffering them against perfectionism and burnout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5279" data-end="5342"&gt;6. Resilience against loneliness through micro‑connections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5344" data-end="5756"&gt;Yes, some recent work warns that acquiring a pet isn’t a magic pill for chronic loneliness—but &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-04-power-pets-loneliness-social-isolation.html"&gt;programs that &lt;/a&gt;leverage pet interactions to build social bridges do show promise . The distinction is subtle: it’s not owning a dog that matters; it’s the social behavior that ownership sparks—smiling at other walkers, sharing funny “conversations” your parrot had at dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5758" data-end="6083"&gt;Pet‑talkers excel here because they naturally weave narrative (“Charlie told me he prefers the park at sunset”) that invites others into dialogue. Psychologists call these narratives “micro‑bids” for connection. People who make them frequently cultivate denser social networks and bounce back faster when isolation threatens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6090" data-end="6145"&gt;7. Mindful presence and moment‑to‑moment awareness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6147" data-end="6511"&gt;Mindfulness is often taught through breath or body scans, but interacting intentionally with an animal can evoke the same state. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8300148/"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; compared a brief mindfulness audio with a guided dog‑interaction and found both interventions equally effective at boosting momentary wellbeing and reducing mind‑wandering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6513" data-end="6840"&gt;When you crouch to your pet’s eye level and narrate what you’re both seeing (“Look at that fluttering leaf, champ!”) you anchor your attention to sensory details. Regular practice strengthens the brain’s default‑mode‑network control, improving focus back at the laptop and making you less susceptible to doom‑scrolling spirals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="6847" data-end="6882"&gt;Putting the strengths to work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6884" data-end="7160"&gt;If you already greet your goldfish with “Morning, mate!” keep going—you’re running a daily emotional‑fitness circuit. If you feel silly, remember that the payoff isn’t about whether your pet grasps syntax; it’s about the skills you rehearse each time you anthropomorphize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="7162" data-end="7389"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7162" data-end="7182"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7164" data-end="7182"&gt;widening empathy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7183" data-end="7220"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7185" data-end="7220"&gt;labelling feelings to soothe them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7221" data-end="7253"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7223" data-end="7253"&gt;flexing imaginative thinking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7254" data-end="7286"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7256" data-end="7286"&gt;reinforcing nurturing habits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7287" data-end="7316"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7289" data-end="7316"&gt;cultivating self‑kindness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7317" data-end="7350"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7319" data-end="7350"&gt;sprinkling social invitations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7351" data-end="7389"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7353" data-end="7389"&gt;grounding attention in the present&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7391" data-end="7720"&gt;Take those strengths outside the living room. Try using the same gentle tone on yourself when a project stalls, or the same playful storytelling to lighten a tense meeting. And if you’re still on the fence about chatting to your pet, you now have seven research‑backed reasons to pull up a chair and ask the cat how her day went.&lt;/p&gt;

The analysis compared vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, focusing on vaccines such as Tdap/Td, shingles (HZ), and pneumococcal immunizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were clear: people vaccinated with Tdap/Td were 30% less likely to develop &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-turn-coffee-waste-into-a-weapon-against-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, shingles and pneumococcal vaccines showed a reduced risk of 25% and 27%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="how_vaccines_may_protect_the_brain"&gt;How Vaccines May Protect the Brain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists believe several mechanisms could explain this protective effect. Vaccines might reduce overall inflammation in your body or help your immune system fight infections that could otherwise speed up cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul E. Schulz explained this theory clearly: "We and others hypothesize that the immune system is responsible for causing brain cell dysfunction in Alzheimer's. The findings suggest to us that vaccination is having a more general effect on the immune system that is reducing the risk for developing Alzheimer's."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expanding further, Avram Bukhbinder, MD, co-author of the study, suggested vaccines might alter how your immune system reacts to the buildup of harmful proteins in your brain, characteristic of Alzheimer's. "Vaccines may change how the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/first-ever-study-reveals-the-impact-of-space-travel-on-the-human-immune-system/"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; responds to the build-up of toxic proteins that contribute to Alzheimer's disease, such as by enhancing the efficiency of immune cells at clearing the toxic proteins," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="importance_of_vaccination_data"&gt;Importance of Vaccination Data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study utilized advanced analytical tools and large-scale healthcare data to ensure robust and reliable results. Yaobin Ling pointed out the significance of this approach, stating, "It's particularly encouraging to observe consistent results across numerous large-scale healthcare databases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Paul E. Schulz, MD, the Rick McCord Professor in Neurology with McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston, was senior author of a study that found several vaccinations were linked to a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease.

Existing therapies involving anti-amyloid antibodies slow &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/breakthrough-ai-finds-a-cause-and-treatment-candidate-for-alzheimers/"&gt;Alzheimer's progression&lt;/a&gt; by about 25% to 35%. This vaccine-based prevention strategy, offering similar or even greater risk reduction, highlights a powerful and accessible alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="understanding_tdap_and_td_vaccines"&gt;Understanding Tdap and Td Vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tdap vaccine protects you from three diseases: &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/revolutionary-skin-cancer-vaccine-dramatically-boosts-survival-rates-in-male-patients/"&gt;tetanus&lt;/a&gt;, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough). Tetanus bacteria live in soil and dust, entering your body through cuts to cause muscle stiffness and spasms. Diphtheria, a bacterial respiratory disease, leads to severe breathing problems and heart issues. Pertussis is highly contagious, causing severe coughing fits, especially dangerous for infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Results of a risk regression model on a) Tdap/Td, b) HZ, and c) pneumococcal vaccinations, stratified by three different ages (65, 75, 85) as measured at baseline.

Health authorities recommend Tdap for adolescents around age 11 or 12, and it’s essential for adults, especially pregnant women, during each pregnancy. Td booster shots are necessary every 10 years to maintain immunity or after severe injuries if your last dose was more than five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kristofer Harris emphasized the broader public health significance of their findings. "Our findings are a win for both Alzheimer's disease prevention research and for public health in general, as this is one more study demonstrating the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/left-or-right-arm-new-study-reveals-why-vaccination-site-matters/"&gt;value of vaccination&lt;/a&gt;," Harris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_promising_path_forward"&gt;A Promising Path Forward&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new study strengthens the argument for routine adult vaccinations beyond traditional disease prevention. Alzheimer’s disease remains incurable, but preventing it by using accessible healthcare measures like vaccination provides hope. Continued research might clarify exactly how vaccines achieve this protective effect, potentially leading to new preventive strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Pairwise Correlation of Covariates in the Unmatched Cohort Prior to Use in the Competing-Risk Regression Model for the Secondary Analysis.

Every child of a parent with Huntington’s — such as my two sisters and I — has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the gene that causes the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AF77L5PNLVBFFPBDHC7XREV5OA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Unlike conditions where you may not get the disease even if you carry the gene, if you test positive for Huntington’s, you will almost certainly develop it at some point. At-risk people can find out whether they have the gene through a testing process that includes a blood draw and appointments with trained genetic counselors who are available to discuss the process and the results before and after the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YJ2HR3FXC5FIDPAZTG4ZKG2DI4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At 27, Lindsey decided to take this step.

But not everyone does. In fact, you can have “silent celiac” and have no idea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, GI specialists explain what silent celiac is, how it’s diagnosed and treated and what to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is silent celiac?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“‘Silent’ celiac disease is when someone has celiac disease, a reaction to the gluten protein, but they do not manifest symptoms from the disease,” said &lt;a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/rabia-a-de-latour" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Rabia De

Latour&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist and assistant professor of medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. “They can have the physical manifestations of the disease like small bowel inflammation but without the GI symptoms like diarrhea and abdominal pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, the form of celiac often called “silent” celiac can also be referred to as “asymptomatic” celiac. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a rare form of celiac, as usually patients develop GI symptoms from the malabsorption, which is secondary to the intestinal damage caused by the celiac disease,” said &lt;a href="https://gastrohealth.com/physicians/kevin-m-cronley-md" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Kevin Cronley" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68669baee4b0d0f8dcccdff4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body"

class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the idea of silent celiac presumes you have no symptoms of the disease, some people might simply not realize they’re experiencing mild symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For probably a portion of those patients who think they have no symptoms, they discover that they did have symptoms and feel much better once they go on a gluten-free diet,” said &lt;a href="https://www.jeffersonhealth.org/find-a-doctor/k/kastenberg-david-m" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. David Kastenberg" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68669baee4b0d0f8dcccdff4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body"

data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. David Kastenberg&lt;/a&gt;, chief of the division of gastroenterology and hepatology at Jefferson Health in the Greater Philadelphia area. “They weren’t aware that they had symptoms because they thought things like headaches, joint aches, chronic sinus problems or muscle aches were just part of their normal everyday life rather than celiac.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is it diagnosed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because this manifestation of celiac disease does not involve clear symptoms, many people go undiagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Silent celiac disease is underdiagnosed, and physicians should have a low threshold to test for it if there are any laboratory abnormalities suggestive of celiac, family history of celiac disease, or other conditions which celiac can be associated with,” Cronley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he noted, further inspection of lab abnormalities are typically the way people with the disease wind up with a diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Someone might have silent GI symptoms but may have abnormal lab findings or nonspecific generalized symptoms like fatigue and headaches,” De Latour noted. “Going to your doctor for regular checkups with appropriate blood work can pick up the lab work signs of celiac before your symptoms might. Someone might have blood work findings suggesting they are not absorbing certain nutrients well from their food due to the gut inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a patient’s bloodwork shows iron deficiency or elevated liver function, for instance, doctors may then check for celiac by doing a blood test for certain antibodies, like tissue transglutaminase antibody. They can also do an upper endoscopy to look at the GI tract and take a sample of tissue from the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Silent celiac might be ‘unsilenced’ if someone is getting an upper endoscopy for something separate like acid reflux and the findings suggest celiac, leading them to go on and do blood tests,” Kastenberg said. “People also need to take notice when someone is at a higher risk for having celiac, like having a first-degree relative with celiac or concomitant medical problem like autoimmune thyroid disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that conditions like type 1 diabetes, Down syndrome and certain skin rashes are also associated with increased risk of celiac disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is it treated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is there’s a clear and effective treatment for celiac disease, silent or otherwise. The bad news is it calls for a big lifestyle change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet,” Cronley said. “Gluten is a protein that is found in wheat that the body will confuse with the lining of the patient’s intestines, causing damage to the intestines. This intestinal injury can result in symptoms of malabsorption, vitamin deficiencies, and can increase the risk of cancer of the small intestine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To remove this harmful protein from the equation and reduce the inflammation, patients must completely cut gluten out of their diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For sicker patients, there are more intense therapies, but this is less common,” De Latour noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there’s now more awareness and understanding around gluten-free eating than in the past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gluten-free diets are popular right now because in general, people feel better on a gluten-free diet by eating less processed foods,” Cronley said. “If you think you may have celiac, seek an evaluation by a physician who can properly evaluate you for the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you get the celiac diagnosis, it’s important to make those dietary changes, even if you don’t feel symptoms after eating gluten. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

If you feel terrible when you have gluten, you get that feedback that you shouldn’t eat that thing. But if you aren’t so sensitive and can eat gluten all the time without feeling it, you aren’t getting that feedback that it’s a problem for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you need to recognize that silent celiac should be taken just as seriously. Ignoring it can lead to long-term issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if you feel well, your small intestine is not well,” Kastenberg emphasized. “It’s not functioning properly, and there are lots of potential consequences like an increased risk for osteoporosis, nutritional deficiencies, malignancies and even reproductive and pregnancy-related issues like low birth weight or spontaneous abortion.

  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;For the 39 million Americans who suffer from migraines, finding effective relief can be a constant struggle – leading many to test out old wives' tales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;Some claim that applying &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;potato slices&lt;/a&gt; to the forehead helps kill the complex headaches, while others submerge their feet in hot water in a desperate search for relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another remedy? Sipping soda, particularly Coke, is said to cure migraines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But does it really work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/americans-told-avoid-coffee-extreme-heat-warning-3-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMERICANS TOLD TO AVOID COFFEE DURING EXTREME HEAT WARNING IN 3 STATES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kay Kennis, a general practitioner in England and a trustee for the Migraine Trust, pointed out that caffeine is the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;main substance in sodas&lt;/a&gt; that may help some migraine sufferers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The caffeine in Coke can act as a nerve disruptor, [as] a substance that affects nerve activity," the expert told Fox News Digital. "For some, that disturbance works in a positive way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Caffeine in soda can act as a nerve disruptor, which may provide some migraine relief, one expert said.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennis added, "There are some painkillers that people take for migraine that have caffeine - and some do respond well to that - but we don't fully know why."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine can be a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/pain-management/headaches-and-migraines" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;trigger for migraines&lt;/a&gt; as well, said the doctor, who advised that too much caffeine consumption can cause "a worse situation in the long run."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/why-red-wine-more-likely-give-you-headache" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY RED WINE IS MORE LIKELY TO GIVE YOU A HEADACHE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blake Livingood, a doctor of natural medicine (DC) based in North Carolina, also noted the impact of caffeine during an interview with Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine can impact blood flow to the brain, he said, which may provide relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Caffeine can constrict blood vessels and change blood flow to the brain."&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Caffeine can constrict blood vessels and change blood flow to the brain, which might help if your headache is related to dilation of those vessels," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But the idea that soda actually cures or prevents migraines - no, it doesn’t."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"Watermelon can give you good electrolytes and improve blood flow, especially if you sprinkle a little salt on it, which also happens to taste great."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Livingood also acknowledged the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/viral-mcmigraine-remedy-has-some-rushing-mcdonalds-headache-relief" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;viral "McMigraine" remedy&lt;/a&gt; that claims sipping Coke and eating McDonald's fries is an effective solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you look at those ingredients - salt, caffeine, and sugar - they can have an impact on blood flow to the head," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Migraines impact tens of millions of Americans, leaving many people reaching for soda to help relieve their pain.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That’s partly why grabbing fries with your soda sometimes seems to help. The salt in the fries, the sugar and the caffeine combined can change circulation and electrolytes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he said there are much healthier ways to get those benefits, ranging from fruit to nuts to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks/coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;organic coffee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Organic coffee is a better caffeine source," Livingood recommended. "Watermelon can give you good electrolytes and improve blood flow, especially if you sprinkle a little salt on it, which also happens to taste great."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;health expert&lt;/a&gt; has also seen success in using magnesium to prevent migraines. He said electrolytes and sodium are key components in prevention and recovery as well, in addition to potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead of reaching for soda to provide caffeine during a migraine headache, an expert recommends trying organic coffee.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Livingood also advised migraine sufferers to try mined salt and sea salt instead of regular table salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any form of salt can impact blood flow and electrolytes, but there are better sources," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sprinkling good-quality salt on watermelon or nuts or even adding a pinch to your water is a healthier way to get those minerals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norbert Heuser, an entpreneur and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/lifestyle-books" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;author of the book&lt;/a&gt; "Coffee Addiction &amp;amp; Caffeinism," also told Fox News Digital he doesn't recommend relying on sugary beverages for migraine relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The sugar content in soda makes it an unhealthy option for migraine sufferers, said one expert.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Migraines are complex and often tied to &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/ask-doctor-can-dehydrated-even-not-thirsty" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;inflammation, dehydration&lt;/a&gt;, toxins like heavy metals and chemicals, or even environmental stressors such as EMF [electromagnetic radiation] from cell phones, WiFi and other sources," the health and wellness advocate said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heuser added, "The high sugar content and artificial additives in sodas and energy drinks can actually make these underlying issues worse over time.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians unanimously recommend this specific bread as the healthiest sandwich option thanks to its high fiber, protein, and nutrient content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look for simple ingredient lists and minimal added sugar and sodium—ideally under 200 mg per slice—to avoid hidden additives and support long-term health goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sprouted breads not only offer a lower glycemic response and better digestibility, but they’re also widely available and versatile enough for both sandwiches and creative recipes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The bread aisle is more extensive than ever. With a wide range of options—many marketed as ‘healthy’—it can be tricky to know which loaf to choose, especially for &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/best-sandwich-recipes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sandwiches&lt;/a&gt;. After all, while store-bought bread can be used in a variety of recipes, a classic sandwich is where many of those slices are ultimately headed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But not all sandwich breads are created equal in terms of health benefits. Some are full of whole food ingredients and packed with a variety of nutrients, while others may contain additives, preservatives, added sugar, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-foods-high-in-sodium-7564072" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sky-high levels of sodium&lt;/a&gt;. “Ingredients and preparation methods make all the difference when choosing a bread,” says Brittany Brown, RD, IBCLC, CDE, registered dietitian and owner of Feeding Babies Nourishing Souls in Nova Scotia, Canada.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, with the help and insights of registered dietitians, we’re here to share the healthiest sandwich bread to look for on your next &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/grocery-shopping-tricks-to-save-money-every-week-11741049" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;grocery store run&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “When it comes to labeling bread as healthy or not, calories don't tell the full story. To &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-bread-7570769" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pick healthier bread&lt;/a&gt;, my non-negotiables are &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-fiber-do-you-need-a-day-7564730" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; and low added sugar,” shares Kaitlin Hippley, M.Ed, RDN, LD, CDCES, certified diabetes educator and dietitian in Cleveland, Ohio. She often chooses a loaf that has at least three grams of fiber to curb cravings and up satiety levels. Plus, this &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-fiber-carbohydrates-7566945" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;complex carbohydrate&lt;/a&gt; conveniently comes with built-in blood sugar regulation&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and digestive health benefits&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Hippley also shares that “less added sugar means fewer energy crashes, fewer cravings, and a lower risk of inflammation&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and weight gain.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Meanwhile Brown prioritizes low-ingredient sandwich breads. “Remember, you really only need a grain, water, salt, and sometimes yeast to make bread; anything else may be an unnecessary addition,” she explains. Most mystery ingredients—like additives, preservatives, and dyes—also lack the evidence needed to understand their long-term health benefits&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The healthiest bread is the bread that helps you reach your overall health goals,” adds Alexis Law, RDN, registered dietitian at Top Nutrition Coaching, explaining that some people might require a lower calorie count, while others may look to &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/fibermaxxing-nutrition-trend-is-it-good-for-you-11733806" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;maximize their fiber intake&lt;/a&gt; or minimize sodium consumption with their bread choice. Aiming for sodium levels of less than 200 milligrams per serving is a great rule of thumb to avoid going overboard with this mineral, which can increase blood pressure&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; when over-consumed over long periods.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-healthiest-sandwich-bread"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Healthiest Sandwich Bread &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to picking a bread MVP, these three dietitians agree that 100 percent whole wheat sprouted bread is the best sandwich bread choice.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “100 percent whole wheat bread is a great option, because it will offer a high amount of nutrients (like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/vitamin-b-foods" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;B vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and minerals like iron, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-zinc-7511268" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-with-more-potassium-than-bananas-11753287" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/foods-high-in-magnesium" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, selenium, and phosphorus) and fiber. It contains all three grain layers—germ, bran, and endosperm—to boost fiber content compared to white bread,” explains Law. Plus, it also has a lower glycemic response&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; than &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/signs-bread-is-unhealthy-8778162" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;white bread&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in less extreme spikes and dips in blood sugar (and energy) levels. Whole grain intake (including breads) is associated with lower chronic disease risk&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, too!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the sprouted front, Brown shares that, “sprouted grains are at their peak nutritionally&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, so these breads are higher in protein, fiber, and omega-3s than typical white or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/cooking-tips-techniques/whole-wheat-whole-grain-breads-0" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole wheat breads&lt;/a&gt;.” This results in a more filling, nourishing bread that also helps to mitigate inflammation&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, sprouted breads tend to have a lower gluten content&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for those sensitive to the wheat protein, and are also often lower in the anti-nutrients&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; found in wheat products that can inhibit the absorption of certain minerals like &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-iron-8702307" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This type of bread is also usually accessible and found in most stores—often offered by store brands to make them more affordable,” Law adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, it’s important to not be deceived by certain ‘wheat’ bread brands. “Surprisingly, many ‘wheat breads’ that seem healthy lack fiber and sneak in more added sugar than you'd expect,” shares Hipley. To avoid this, look for ‘100 percent’ or ‘whole’ on wheat breads, and be sure to double check the ingredients list.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you have your sprouted whole grain bread home, there are plenty of ways to make a delicious sandwich—and other recipes—with it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Law's go-to sandwiches include &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/tuna-salad-tartines-8419800" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tuna salad&lt;/a&gt; or turkey and cucumber. “I love adding &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/cucumber-health-benefits-7371080" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cucumber&lt;/a&gt; to a sandwich along with raw spinach to get a nice crunch and easily add more veggies to a meal,” she shares.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Brown also loves tuna (tuna melt with pickled onions, specifically!), nut butter and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/food/how-to-store-bananas" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;banana&lt;/a&gt;, and an ‘egg in a hole’ sandwich—though she has some ingenious uses for stale store-bought sandwich bread, too. “Don’t overlook stale bread; toast the crumbled crusts in a pan with herbs for homemade croutons or salad toppers,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Meanwhile, Hipley, also often whips up a tuna salad sando or homemade PB and J—but has some other tried and true recipes she adores, too. “&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/cottage-cheese-health-benefits-7109196" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt; topped with fresh garden tomatoes and a drizzle of olive oil and smashed avocado with an egg or hemp or &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/chia-seeds-vs-flax-seeds-11709668" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; are also some of my favorites,” she adds.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the end of the day, a healthy sandwich bread can turn a fairly healthy lunch into something particularly nutritious—not the other way around, as bread is often unfairly vilified. “Bread itself is not to be feared, unless there is an allergy or intolerance, and it can be a great way to add fiber easily to the diet,” Law encourages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For the very healthiest store-bought option, try a sprouted whole wheat loaf. “Sprouted grain breads like Dave’s Killer Bread or Silver Hills are two of my top picks for healthy sandwich breads,” Brown shares. These loaves offer fiber, protein, B vitamins, minerals, and even &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-fats-8740244" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;, arguably qualifying them as bona fide superfoods.&lt;br&gt;

Dubbed sea poisoning, ocean itch and &lt;a href="https://miamidade.floridahealth.gov/programs-and-services/environmental-health/_documents/sea-lice.pdf" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;even seabather’s eruption,&lt;/a&gt; sea lice can sully a beach day with itchy, stinging rashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their parasitic moniker, sea lice aren’t actually lice. They don’t suck blood or have much in common with head lice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“’Sea lice’ is an umbrella term that many people use to describe a wide variety of tiny, stinging plankton or nekton,” said &lt;a href="https://www.dnr.sc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;South Carolina Department of Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt; spokesperson Erin Weeks in an email. “These can include sea butterflies (pteropods, a type of sea snails), jellyfish larvae, blue crab larvae, and other unidentified crustacean larvae.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what beachgoers should know about these tiny, sometimes painful, sea creatures before hitting the coast this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why sea lice irritate swimmers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they don’t bite, sea lice irritate skin, especially around hair and apparel. The tiny creatures are too small to be identified by the human eye, but leave behind irritating rashes, which &lt;a href="https://www.tidelandshealth.org/" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;Tidelands Health &lt;/a&gt;Family Medicine physician Dr. Sean Nguyen describes as similar to poison ivy and other contact rashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really not the direct contact with your skin,” Nguyen said. “When you go in the water, it’s areas where the ‘lice’ or larvae are getting between your hair that’s wet, or your bathing suit, or anywhere if you’re wearing a rash guard or any type of shirt, it just gets in between that space and kind of irritates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The severity and scale of a rash depends on the sea lice encountered and how a person’s skin reacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where are sea lice found?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sea lice are found in salt water across South Carolina’s coast. The speck-sized creatures get carried by the tides, so if you or someone else on the beach encounters them, it’s probably best to steer clear for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because they are often plankton, which drift with the currents, ‘sea lice’ tend to be quite localized,” Weeks said. “If they’ve been reported in the area, you can often wait or try another stretch of beach to avoid them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When are sea lice most common?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;People tend to encounter sea lice most often in the summer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These aren’t well studied and it’s difficult to speak in general terms about a number of different organisms, but, naturally, reports are highest in the hot summer months when the largest number of beachgoers are in the ocean,” Weeks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="13" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s unclear if certain species are more populous along South Carolina’s coast in the summer, Nguyen agrees human contact is most frequent during the vacation season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We say about April to August, that’s when the waters usually have the highest possibility of having these ‘lice’ in the water,” said Nguyen. “That’s when you’re going to come into contact with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Removing sea lice from clothes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nguyen says swimmers affected by sea lice should exit the water as soon as they notice irritation and remove swimwear and clothes as quickly as possible. Because sea lice can get trapped in apparel, it’s better to thoroughly rinse the body and hair off in the nude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-107" class="zone zone-el" index="17" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After swimwear and clothing have trapped sea lice, it’s a good idea to thoroughly wash them. Exposure to heat can also help kill any remaining sea lice left over. But ultimately, if apparel continues to cause issues, it may be time to part ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If it’s just severely irritating, your skin is breaking out, sometimes we recommend just getting rid of the bathing suit, if you feel like it’s still irritating you even after you’ve cleaned it,” Nguyen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to treat sea lice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once people stung are rid of their apparel, it’s best to rinse off as soon as possible. Although Nguyen generally recommends using lukewarm water, temperature can be adjusted hot or cold, depending on what’s comfortable and provides relief from itching and stinging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-108" class="zone zone-el" index="21" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rinsing with saltwater and acidic solutions like vinegar can also help dislodge or neutralize stinging cells from the sea lice, according to Weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the area is clean, topical treatments like ice or aloe can help manage discomfort or pain. Similar to insect bite treatments, topical creams can also help ease irritation and slow a rash after skin is exposed to a toxin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What you’re trying to do is kind of prevent the spread of the rash,” said Nguyen. “Once your body kind of recognizes that it’s been foreign body or foreign irritation is there, it tries to create a chain reaction to create a larger rash.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-109" class="zone zone-el" index="24" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For milder rashes, antihistamine cream and calamine lotion may help, while more severe irritation may benefit from steroid creams. No matter how badly a rash itches, it’s important to resist the urge to scratch, which will irritate the skin further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most of these rashes will go away on its own once you get away from the exposure,” Nguyen said. “Some people will have to take an antihistamine, an allergy pill, a Zyrtec, a Benadryl to calm the rash down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When to seek medical help&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most sea lice rashes heal with little issue, some people may experience complications. Nguyen recommends reaching out to a doctor or medical provider if exposure produces more severe reactions, like fever, headache or nausea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-110" class="zone zone-el" index="28" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I tell all my patients, if it’s something you just want any provider to look at, contact your doctor,” Nguyen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="story-module"&gt;&lt;div class="author-card "&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The Rock loves it, Zac Efron invests in it, and Equinox gym members are signing up for it in droves. Function Health is the latest hot commodity for &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/simple-longevity-tricks-to-improve-diet-routine-2025-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; seekers looking to optimize their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The promise is simple: skip the waiting room at the doctor's office and head straight to the lab, for comprehensive medical testing that evaluates the health of key organs, like your &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/test-heart-health-simple-exercises-to-live-longer-cardiologist" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Function also measures some things that "regular" doctors typically don't, like &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-elite-athletes-curb-water-intake-after-4pm-top-dietitian-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;electrolyte&lt;/a&gt; levels as well as the so-called "heavy metals" — lead, mercury — potentially poisonous substances that can sometimes lurk in our air, water, and food. It might even find cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see what all the big buzz was about with this $500 annual blood-and-pee testing service, so I tried it out. Disclaimer: I didn't have to pay for it, because Function Health gave out free trials to journalists as the company is still in beta testing mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, my Function results led me to seek out more advice from doctors than I usually would, to help me separate the signal from the noise in all the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="6dc5fe0a-902f-43cc-b07f-efdc842f9024" data-toc-id="6dc5fe0a-902f-43cc-b07f-efdc842f9024"&gt;I freaked out about all the little cholesterol particles hiding out in my blood&lt;/h2&gt;

                      My Function results flagged seven "out of range" tests, and three of those were related to heart health.

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The good news is that Function is not a huge time suck. It takes about 15 minutes to get the initial testing done and you can roll up to just about any Quest Diagnostics lab location nationwide (except in Hawaii and Rhode Island).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their tests measure over 90 different biomarkers in your blood and urine, including almost all the typical stuff you'd find in a doctor's office (except STD testing). Function performed roughly three times the number of tests I had done the last time I went to the doctor's office for routine bloodwork. There were more measurements related to hormones, key nutrients, my metabolism, and heart health. Function Health also measured my "&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-the-maximum-age-of-humans-115-or-older-2023-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;biological age&lt;/a&gt;," a scientifically squishy indicator of health and fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so many tests being run, there's a good chance that something you measure when you do Function will come back abnormal. That doesn't always mean there's something wrong with you; sometimes your own "normal" doesn't fit neatly into a given reference range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Function is OK with having a few errant flags in the data, and encourages re-testing any out of range labs. Their ethos is the more information, the better. It's about creating a more detailed picture of your overall health, not making sure each test is perfect every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are "wanting to know more about their biology, and to be advocates for their own health," Dr. Mark Hyman, one of the founders of Function Health, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hyman, a longtime friend of US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., chalks it up "to disillusionment with healthcare in general" in the US. Hyman says many people who use Function's tests may be able to resolve their own health concerns without ever seeing a doctor afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While you'll need to see a doctor for certain things, the beauty of Function is you come in, follow up, order follow up tests on yourself, and then you can follow the guidance," Hyman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His venture dovetails with the rise of new tech promising to put you in the driver's seat of your own health. Think wearables (&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/oura-ring-fitness-tracker-pros-cons-after-years-wearing-style-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt;, watches, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/glucose-monitors-over-the-counter-track-blood-sugar-health-fitness-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;glucose monitors&lt;/a&gt;) and concierge medicine (full body MRIs, anti-aging &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nad-iv-therapy-we-tried-hollywood-secret-longevity-hack-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;IV drips&lt;/a&gt;). As the personalized medicine industry booms, Function is taking off. The company says its membership has more than doubled since December, to more than 200,000 customers.&lt;/p&gt;

While my regular LDL, or "bad" cholesterol number — the one you'd get measured in a doctor's office — looked fine, Function also measured the size of my LDL cholesterol particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, I had slightly elevated numbers of small and medium sized LDL cholesterol particles, which are more dangerous than larger LDL particles. This "could indicate an increased risk for cardiovascular disease despite normal LDL cholesterol levels," my results said, adding "it is vital to address the out-of-range results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a surprise. I had always been told I have "good" cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started imagining all those tiny, sticky cholesterol particles racing towards my aging heart. Knowing how important &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/heart-healthy-habits-reverse-biological-age-study-2023-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;heart health is for healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;, and that heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US, I started to worry. Should I quit my beloved mayonnaise? Maybe I should at least cut back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my initial shock, I reached out to independent cardiologists and longevity doctors for this story. I also spoke directly to Hyman about my results. All of those physicians refocused my attention, helping me interpret the results, and zoom in on the more meaningful ways to adjust my lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frankly, they reminded me why this kind of testing isn't widely recommended, and why we go to the doctor in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="e98fa65b-9a2a-42c9-98de-72b2656c9dd1" data-toc-id="e98fa65b-9a2a-42c9-98de-72b2656c9dd1"&gt;Without help from doctors, I was stressing about the wrong things in my labs and on my plate&lt;/h2&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                      Function recommended five supplements for me: vitamin D, omega-3, CoQ10, berberine, and fiber.

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even for me, a seasoned health journalist who isn't generally freaked out by medical test results, this felt like a lot to take in. In addition to the supposedly off-balance cholesterol numbers, there was also low vitamin D, and a few other items that could impact everything from my immunity to metabolism and fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a doctor's advice, I found it was easy to get lost in the noise of all the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think if you showed any cardiologist or lipidologist your panel, they wouldn't be worrying about you," Dr. Ken Feingold, an emeritus professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who is an expert on lipids and lipoprotein metabolism, told BI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cholesterol numbers that really matter were fine, including the basics (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL) but also some of the more niche measurements that doctors are now factoring into clinical decision-making, like lipoprotein A and apolipoprotein B (APOB), Feingold said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it would be very unfair to expect a consumer, the person that had the lab work done to try and figure it out on their own," Dr. David Sabgir, a cardiologist in Ohio who is also not involved with Function Health, told BI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, Function is designed to help consumers make simple nutrition tweaks they hadn't thought to make — perhaps adding fatty fish for omega-3, vitamin D, or fiber supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"80% of people's health issues will never need a doctor," Hyman said. "They're really lifestyle-driven and they can be modified through modifying your diet and your lifestyle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as a consumer, I found the barrage of information confusing, making it harder to feel in control of good decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, while Function gave me diet and supplement recommendations (vitamin D, fiber, berberine, omega-3, and coQ10, along with more fish and eggs), it buried the most important piece of nutrition advice that every doctor I spoke to was quickly able to point out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2d701cd4-7837-4216-87ac-d73dbbadc187" data-toc-id="2d701cd4-7837-4216-87ac-d73dbbadc187"&gt;Doctors told me to cut back on white bread and enjoy avocados&lt;/h2&gt;

                      Doctors recommended replacing white bread with whole grains, and enjoying healthy fats like avocados.

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a follow-up interview with Hyman — which is not standard procedure for Function patients — he told me I could improve my particle numbers by cutting down on, or ideally eliminating, refined starches and sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was advice that was not highlighted in my Function dashboard, but other doctors wholeheartedly agreed. It was the first thing they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miora longevity clinic director Dr. Gregory Pippert uses advanced blood testing that's similar to Function's, often catering to patients who are trying to optimize their health and gains in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I look at so much green on that," he said of my cholesterol panel. "Then I see particle numbers that are not massively high."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Pippert, the headline was simple: just skip the refined grains more often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do I really, really need the big extra thick slice of white bread? Maybe not," Pippert said. "It's making the good choices more than the bad choices, but not obsessing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing more granular data may help some patients take general pieces of health advice — to hit the gym five days a week, incorporate more strength training, or adhere to heart healthy diets, like the Mediterranean diet, more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The anxiety associated with the results may trigger more compliance with lifestyle modification," Sabgir said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how can we be sure we'll pick out the right tweaks on our own? If I'm skipping mayo but not switching to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/whole-grain-bigger-meals-provide-more-energy-dietitian-advice-2022-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt; or cutting back on sugar, I'm probably not going to have a huge impact on my test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know why people are offering this," Feingold said. "It's a way to make a lot of money because sure, they're charging a significant amount of money for this, but you don't really need it to make decisions about who you're going to treat, most of the time."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online dating apps have transformed the dating market, yet their broader effects remain unclear. We study Tinder’s impact on college students using its initial marketing focus on Greek organizations for identification. We show that the full-scale launch of Tinder led to a sharp, persistent increase in sexual activity, but with little corresponding impact on the formation of long-term relationships or relationship quality. Dating outcome inequality, especially among men, rose, alongside rates of sexual assault and STDs. However, despite these changes, Tinder’s introduction did not worsen students’ mental health, on average, and may have even led to improvements for female students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is from &lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20240455&amp;amp;from=f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a new paper&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;span&gt;Berkeren Büyükeren, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alexey Makarin, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Heyu Xiong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A recent study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2502760" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that cancer patients who participated in a structured exercise program had better outcomes, living longer without cancer recurrence and having a lower risk of death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's findings suggest that exercise should be a key component of cancer treatment, helping patients live longer and healthier lives. By incorporating exercise into their care plan, cancer patients can potentially improve their survival rates and reduce the risk of recurrence of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The study tells how regular exercise lowers the risk of cancer recurrence &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinical trial, conducted across multiple countries, followed nearly 900 patients diagnosed with stage II and stage III colon cancer. Participants had completed surgery and chemotherapy and were split into two groups: one group received structured exercise coaching twice monthly for the first six months, then monthly for three years, and the other group received usual care without specific exercise guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The results of the study were striking &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those in the exercise group had a 28% lower risk of cancer recurrence or developing a new cancer. More significantly, they had a 37% lower risk of death from any cause during an eight-year follow-up period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular fitness and endurance also improved in the exercise group, as shown by a better six-minute walk test and VO₂ max results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Experts suggest structured exercise should be a part of a cancer recovery plan &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As CNN spoke with Dr. Leana Wen, the potential for exercise to revolutionize cancer treatment became clear. The study's findings are significant, showing that exercise can substantially reduce the risk of recurrent or new cancers and death. According to Dr. Wen, these results could change cancer treatment protocols. Currently, patients often receive general advice to exercise after treatment, but many don't receive structured support. She suggests that patients should have "exercise prescriptions" and healthcare providers should track their progress. Insurance companies might also consider covering health coaching for cancer patients, potentially reducing the need for costly treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why exercise helps fight cancer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Leana Wen, exercise doesn’t just make you feel good, it alters your body at a cellular and hormonal level, helping to: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regulate hormones like insulin and estrogen that are linked to cancer growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce chronic inflammation, which contributes to cancer progression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhance immune function, supporting your body’s ability to detect and destroy abnormal cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support a healthy body weight, which is a major factor in cancer recurrence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This multi-layered impact makes exercise a powerful, non-pharmacological tool for improving cancer outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 06:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAJBVV95cUxPWUplVGhpb05NMVdaaWMxNUhVaGdPek9CN2lxVDRHMkZpN0JROW51WjJEblVHQ2VjdEUxOVA1ZWxfN3BUeWZDXzhKR2hOUldJQndZV25HY1IwOU9ZenNra3ZDRjNOUFRMczFEVXlKbWE1WVk3dGFMMU9YTU16RzJyTENnQ3JsUXRhYXJwSkE1by1yVmtMdWhORlpVY053Mzg5Ty1VZWh6VUo3eVNqVkRodXVjaXFaeTFZeFRCbmJhRUxXZzVMbzcycXlLczhYZnJxNEZyUmszdFA1bll6S0NQa1JSYjR4ZDlsQkFfWDc5bl9UeF9QN3pmODJEUFd2eXZ6NUZsZXBQNXJ5dGJo</guid></item><item><title>“令人震惊”的结果：阻断一种酶使帕金森受损细胞恢复活力- SciTechDaily | “Astounding” Results: Blocking One Enzyme Brings Parkinson’s-Damaged Cells Back to Life - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxNVGFPZzBXaVowR1QySTFIdVBlN0dmS2RudVpKeE1KYVZ6SE5iaVU3N1NMcjR4VlBaRk1fTDhoYVk0bTZZMS1kZHp1ZzFEN0M5ckdTOVczRXRqYjBDVlhCbmVualJ4WF9sa1NzQzRHY2VYZUVNWkZEWDdyZFRVcXFPRWRhTkJ0YWRHdUxudlNBN1pqWXVsZm5hSEU4SjFKUUxqdUgtajFfb3Zfc2UyNnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 04:09:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxNVGFPZzBXaVowR1QySTFIdVBlN0dmS2RudVpKeE1KYVZ6SE5iaVU3N1NMcjR4VlBaRk1fTDhoYVk0bTZZMS1kZHp1ZzFEN0M5ckdTOVczRXRqYjBDVlhCbmVualJ4WF9sa1NzQzRHY2VYZUVNWkZEWDdyZFRVcXFPRWRhTkJ0YWRHdUxudlNBN1pqWXVsZm5hSEU4SjFKUUxqdUgtajFfb3Zfc2UyNnc</guid></item><item><title>如果你不每天大便，你的身体会发生什么- EatingWell | What Happens to Your Body If You Don’t Poop Every Day - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxPSjJoeWZxMXFUS3hZYUliUlNaR1NLLUpza3lDUHlFS0pndWpUM2llS0pLMXo5NjBrTW5zcjFORzEtOGdIWHl2blFJY282RHB2dlFGdjh6dkZRelNzVThpS0hpNFE3T1Q2cmhoYldiV04yTEs5MFF6eUdtaHA0QUZRdldB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our bodies are unique and how often we poop varies from person to person.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Symptoms such as bloating or hard stools may indicate that you are not going to the bathroom frequently enough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Staying hydrated, exercising regularly, getting enough fiber and stressing less can help you stay regular.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to gut health, most people probably assume that pooping every day is the goal. However, experts agree that you can have a healthy gut and not poop every day. Since every body is a little different, not everyone goes No. 2 with the same frequency. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s not bad if you don’t poop everyday, because we all have a different version of normal. If we think of pooping like taking out the trash, then you want to be sure that you’re doing it regularly. So while you may not poop every day, it’s important that there is regularity,” says &lt;a href="https://amandasauceda.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Amanda Sauceda, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve ever been worried that you aren’t pooping every day, read on to find out why not pooping daily may not be such a bad thing and how to recognize when it may be a problem. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-is-it-bad-if-you-dont-poop-every-day"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Is It Bad If You Don’t Poop Every Day? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; No, you don’t have to poop every day and your gut can still be in tip-top shape. “Bowel habits are variable within the general population. Suppose a person has between three bowel movements per week and three per day, with soft, formed stools and minimal defecatory symptoms. In that case, this is considered within the range of normal bowel patterns,” says &lt;a href="https://atlanticcoastgastro.com/physicians/sandhya-shukla-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sandhya Shukla, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; Shukla goes on to add that there are no negative physiological consequences for otherwise healthy people if you aren’t going No. 2 daily.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So why is there so much variability when it comes to “normal” bowel habits? Several factors influence how frequently a person poops, including diet, hydration, stress, certain medications and activity levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-happens-inside-your-body"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Happens Inside Your Body? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The moment we take a bite of food or a sip of a beverage, our digestive system begins breaking down the food into essential nutrients. So while you may not go No. 2 every day, there is plenty happening in your gut behind the scenes. As waste is formed, it collects in the colon until your body signals that it’s time to head to the bathroom. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, if you aren’t pooping regularly, you may start to notice some uncomfortable symptoms. First, there’s gas and bloating. &lt;a href="https://wholeisticliving.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jenna Volpe, RDN, LD, CLT&lt;/a&gt;, shares that when stool remains in the intestines, it can ferment, leading to increased gas or bloating.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research suggests that the composition of your gut microbiome may play a role; individuals prone to constipation often have different strains of bacteria present in their gut microbiome compared to healthy individuals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to the potential for gas and bloating, you may experience dry and hard stools. “When you aren’t pooping regularly you will be more prone to dry, hard stools. This can mean that when you do poop you may notice that you’re struggling a bit, which puts more pressure on your pelvic floor and can lead to developing hemorrhoids and/or anal fissures,” says Sauceda.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, if pooping is our body’s natural means of eliminating waste, does skipping a day or two allow it to become toxic? While this is a popular selling point for colon cleanses, there isn’t scientific evidence to back up the theory that your poop can poison your body if you aren’t pooping daily.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Your microbiome, which is a key player in your immune system, is well-equipped to protect you. In fact, colon cleanses may sweep away the good gut bacteria you need to support healthy bowel habits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-when-skipping-poops-does-become-a-problem"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; When Skipping Poops Does Become a Problem &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While “regular” can mean something slightly different for everyone, healthy bowel movements should meet these criteria: “A healthy, normal consistency (but not too hard), brown in color and about 6 to 12 inches long and 1 to 2 inches in diameter (resembling a sausage or a peeled banana),” says Volpe. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the other hand, skipping a poop becomes a problem if it has been longer than three days and you are starting to feel uncomfortable. The most common symptoms indicating that you’re not pooping often enough include bloating, excess gas and stools that are hard, dry or difficult to pass. Fortunately, you can address a sluggish digestive system with a few small changes to your diet or lifestyle.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you aren’t pooping regularly, here are a few tips from our experts that can help you get things moving again. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydrate:&lt;/strong&gt; “We all know to eat more fiber, but don’t discount water. While fiber is critical to get things moving, we have to help it along by staying hydrated. If you aren’t drinking enough water, then you can make constipation worse,” says Sauceda.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Your Stress&lt;/strong&gt;: “Stress can also slow things down in the gut, so addressing the stress can help get things moving. There is a strong connection between the mind and the gut, so if your mind is stressed, that can translate to a stressed gut,” says Sauceda.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Fiber&lt;/strong&gt;: “Incorporating fiber-rich foods (such as fresh fruit, veggies or functional foods like chia seeds and/or ground flaxseeds) into the diet can go a long way to help get things moving in most cases,” says Volpe. She adds that you’ll want to make sure you are drinking plenty of fluids when adding more fiber to your diet. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move Your Body:&lt;/strong&gt; “Movement and moderate exercise can also help to promote healthy gut motility and regular bowel movements,” says Volpe.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “It doesn’t have to be anything too extreme or intense—even 20 minutes of walking each day (or most days) can make a big difference in gut motility!” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supplement When Needed: &lt;/strong&gt;If you have tried increasing your fiber and fluid intake as well as being more active, and you’re still feeling backed up, supplements may help. Shukla notes that magnesium or prune juice are good options for getting things moving again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-when-to-see-a-health-care-provider"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; When to See a Health Care Provider &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since everyone’s “normal” bowel habits are different, research has found it’s more important to look out for changes in your normal pooping schedule. For example, not going to the bathroom regularly for two weeks or longer is a strong indicator that you should follow up with your doctor.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “The red flag symptoms or warning signs that may indicate a more serious underlying condition in a patient presenting with constipation include rectal bleeding, blood mixed in the stool, unexplained weight loss, iron-deficiency anemia, a sudden or significant change in bowel habits, a change in stool caliber and a strong family history of colorectal cancer. The presence of any of these features should prompt further evaluation, typically with colonoscopy, to exclude colorectal malignancy or other serious pathology,” says Shukla.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s a common misconception that you need to poop every day for optimal gut health. Everyone goes to the bathroom on a different schedule; the key is to recognize what’s normal for you and take note if you’re experiencing discomfort. Symptoms like bloating or hard stools are indicators that you aren’t going to the bathroom frequently enough, and it may be time to adjust your diet or activity to promote regular bowel movements.&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-warns-consumers-not-purchase-or-use-any-tianeptine-product-due-serious-risks"&gt;issued an urgent warning&lt;/a&gt; about tianeptine – a substance marketed as a dietary supplement but known on the street as "gas station heroin".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linked to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/tianeptine-products-linked-serious-harm-overdoses-death"&gt;overdoses and deaths&lt;/a&gt;, it is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7304a5.htm?s_cid=mm7304a5_w"&gt;being sold&lt;/a&gt; in petrol stations, smoke shops and online retailers, despite never being approved for medical use in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what exactly is tianeptine, and why is it causing alarm?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fda-issues-eye-drops-warning-after-deadly-outbreak-of-bacterial-infections?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;FDA Issues Eye Drops Warning After Deadly Outbreak of Bacterial Infections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40122-023-00539-5"&gt;Tianeptine&lt;/a&gt; was developed in France in the 1960s and approved for medical use in the late 1980s as a &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_J2ti4EkYpkC&amp;amp;pg=PA3222"&gt;treatment for depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structurally, it resembles tricyclic antidepressants – an older class of antidepressant – but pharmacologically it behaves &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4119213/"&gt;very differently&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike conventional antidepressants, which typically increase serotonin levels, tianeptine appears to act on the brain's glutamate system, which is involved in learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is used as a prescription drug in some European, Asian and Latin American countries under brand names &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11587517/"&gt;like Stablon or Coaxil&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25026323/"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; later discovered something unusual, tianeptine also activates the brain's &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-018-0225-3"&gt;mu-opioid receptors&lt;/a&gt;, the same receptors targeted by morphine and heroin – hence it's nickname "gas station heroin".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A box of Stablon pills." src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=464&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=464&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=464&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=583&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=583&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=583&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;As a prescription drug, tianeptine is sold under various brand names, including Stablon. (IllusionalFate/&lt;a class="source" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=26786285"&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At prescribed doses, the effect is subtle, but in large amounts, tianeptine can trigger &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/tianeptine-products-linked-serious-harm-overdoses-death"&gt;euphoria, sedation and eventually dependence&lt;/a&gt;. People chasing a high might take doses far beyond anything recommended in medical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite never being approved by the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/information-select-dietary-supplement-ingredients-and-other-substances/tianeptine-dietary-supplements"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;, the drug is sold in the US as a "wellness" product or nootropic – a substance supposedly used to &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/tianeptine-is-safe-use-possible/art-20562252"&gt;enhance mood or mental clarity&lt;/a&gt;. It's packaged as capsules, powders or liquids, often misleadingly labelled as dietary supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This loophole has enabled companies to circumvent regulation. Products like Neptune's Fix have been promoted as safe and legal alternatives to traditional medications, despite lacking any clinical oversight and often containing unlisted or dangerous ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some samples have even been found to contain &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38300852/"&gt;synthetic cannabinoids and other drugs&lt;/a&gt;. According to US poison control data, calls related to tianeptine exposure rose by over &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39724478/"&gt;500% between 2018 and 2023&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/tianeptine-products-linked-serious-harm-overdoses-death"&gt;In 2024 alone&lt;/a&gt;, the drug was involved in more than 300 poisoning cases. The FDA's latest advisory included product recalls and import warnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users have taken to the social media site Reddit, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingTianeptine/"&gt;including a dedicated channel&lt;/a&gt;, and other forums to describe their experiences, both the highs and the grim withdrawals. Some report taking hundreds of pills a day. Others struggle to quit, describing cravings and relapses that mirror those seen with classic opioid addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since tianeptine doesn't show up in standard toxicology screenings, health professionals &lt;a href="https://keystonelab.com/tianeptine/tianeptine-drug-testing-guidelines/"&gt;may not recognise it&lt;/a&gt;. According to doctors in North America, it could be present in hospital patients without being detected, particularly in cases involving &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/tianeptine-is-safe-use-possible/art-20562252"&gt;seizures or unusual heart symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People report experiencing withdrawal symptoms that resemble those of opioids, like &lt;a href="https://www.crew.scot/drug/fentanyl/"&gt;fentanyl&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6730a2.htm"&gt;anxiety, tremors, insomnia, diarrhoea and muscle pain&lt;/a&gt;. Some have been hospitalised due to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-warns-consumers-not-purchase-or-use-any-tianeptine-product-due-serious-risks"&gt;seizures, loss of consciousness and respiratory depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;UK legality&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, tianeptine is not licensed for medical use by the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency"&gt;Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency&lt;/a&gt; and it is not classified as a controlled substance under the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/controlled-drugs-list--2/list-of-most-commonly-encountered-drugs-currently-controlled-under-the-misuse-of-drugs-legislation"&gt;Misuse of Drugs Act 1971&lt;/a&gt;. That puts it in a legal grey area, not formally approved, but not illegal to possess either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be bought online from overseas vendors, and a quick search reveals dozens of sellers offering "research-grade" powder and capsules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is little evidence that tianeptine is circulating widely in the UK; to date, just one confirmed sample has been publicly recorded in a national drug testing &lt;a href="https://www.wedinos.org/"&gt;database&lt;/a&gt;. It's not mentioned in recent Home Office or Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/controlled-drugs-list--2/list-of-most-commonly-encountered-drugs-currently-controlled-under-the-misuse-of-drugs-legislation"&gt;briefings&lt;/a&gt;, and it does not appear in official crime or hospital statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that may simply reflect the fact that no one is looking for it. Without testing protocols in place, it could be present, just unrecorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of its &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Tianeptine"&gt;chemical structure&lt;/a&gt; and unusual effects, if tianeptine did show up in a UK emergency department, it could easily be mistaken for a tricyclic antidepressant overdose, or even dismissed as recreational drug use. This makes it harder to diagnose and treat appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's possible, particularly among people seeking alternatives to harder-to-access opioids, or those looking for a legal high. With its low visibility, online availability and potential for addiction, tianeptine ticks many of the same boxes that once made drugs like &lt;a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/mcat-meow-meow-drug-2024-young-people-london-raves-b1185517.html"&gt;mephedrone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.crew.scot/drug/synthetic-cannabinoids/"&gt;spice&lt;/a&gt; popular before they were banned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK has seen waves of novel psychoactive substances emerge through similar routes, first appearing online or in head shops, then spreading quietly until authorities &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-uk-has-banned-drugs-that-dont-even-exist-yet-psychoactive-substances-act/"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;. If tianeptine follows the same path, by the time it appears on the radar, harm may already be underway.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259194/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

While medications and lifestyle play a vital role, adding a single vegetable can naturally improve blood sugar control, even for those with diabetes. A new study found that eating a certain vegetable has been linked to improved blood sugar levels in prediabetes, a precursor to type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study conducted at the University of Gothenburg found that a compound in broccoli has a more significant effect on blood sugar levels in certain people. The study is published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-025-01932-w" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Broccoli’s role in managing blood sugar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has found that sulforaphane, a compound found in broccoli, is an antidiabetic agent in type 2 diabetes. A study conducted in 2017 found reduced &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/diabetes-10-smart-fruit-choices-to-help-manage-blood-sugar-levels/photostory/122145614.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in people with diabetes after they took large doses of sulforaphane extracted from broccoli sprouts. The new study looked at the impact of this compound in controlling blood sugar in people with prediabetes. This condition is a precursor to type 2 diabetes, with slowly rising blood sugar levels due to impaired insulin production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The study &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 89 people with elevated fasting blood sugar, a sign of prediabetes. They were all between 35 and 75 years old and were either overweight or obese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were randomly given either sulforaphane or a placebo for 12 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither they nor the researchers knew who got what. By the end, 74 people completed all stages of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Significant change in fasting blood sugar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study were striking. The participants, who consumed the sulforaphane compound had a higher average reduction in fasting blood sugar than those who didn’t. In some participants, the results were even more prominent. Certain participants had more benefits. The group with the greatest improvement after taking sulforaphane had early signs of mild age-related diabetes, a relatively low BMI in the context of the study, low insulin resistance, low incidence of fatty liver disease, and low insulin secretion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Possible precision treatment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prediabetes affects millions of people across the world, and there is no clear treatment structure currently in place. This is because the condition often remains undetected. Early detection increases the chances of not developing type 2 diabetes. Anders Rosengren stressed the importance of early and individualized interventions to prevent the disease. The treatment of prediabetes is currently lacking in many respects, but these new findings open the way for possible precision treatment using sulforaphane extracted from broccoli as a functional food. However, lifestyle factors remain the foundation of any treatment for prediabetes, including exercise, healthy eating, and weight loss. The results of the study also offer a general model of how pathophysiology and gut flora interact with and influence treatment responses. A model that could have broader implications," Anders Rosengren said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Kheera for weight loss: 5 reasons to eat cucumber with every meal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwJBVV95cUxNOWpkM0p2dHAwMHJQem5aVE5zNHpqcFN5akhtZXowT1NWbkNjTDVlTUtiREhpekR5OHIzWGlqbFAyOHFlbFVSei1NY01hVW5rQXNjMnEyUDF0VnphTnBQTFRTd2ZsZWphbUxhQUlEdmhFZ1JNbkpLcE9QMDJ5VzdvVkU5VC10RXVRSmE1RTZsLTFqQjNMV1FiMTZtSGp0aWNteEpCNEkzdUVxS3c1WElJRFh1OWRVanp2M2lkU3BSRl9iekpJdE9XWDZBLVZKREJudXQwV0t2SW9uYnZXU3NEbmJiaC04ZV85VDRvNEstQkZOOG1hWXhBclBzN204SWZMOUt1X2tUdy1ZOE1ETV9V</guid></item><item><title>“它直接导致至少七种癌症” ： 30位肿瘤学家提供了您不应忽视的提示-无聊的熊猫 | “It Directly Causes At Least Seven Kinds Of Cancer”: 30 Oncologists Give Tips You Shouldn’t Ignore - Bored Panda</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE9leFV3clowbkJ4el9xTXVGR1NKWV84WDJEYUxUd1JVaVJFUnNVTElCekxoTFJRQmZ1Qjc4dDFjbUJ3V3J4LWotUGh2N1JLeEstMG9ZamRONzk5dWNtWmx1MjhzR2ZtckFYT0dYMEt4bkphb1JLWnVvcTFoV3kzd0k?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="open-list-post-description"&gt;  &lt;p class="ql-align-justify"&gt;The dreaded C-word... &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/fighting-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. It's a leading cause of death worldwide, with nearly 10 million people dying from the disease every year. An estimated 618,120 cancer-related deaths are estimated in 2025, in the United States alone.

The disease is among the leading causes of death worldwide, and America's National Cancer Institute (NCI) has &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics#:~:text=Cancer%20is%20among%20the%20leading,related%20deaths%20to%2018.2%20million." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that there were almost 20 million new cases and 9.7 million cancer-related deaths worldwide in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2050, the number of new cancer cases per year is expected to rise to 33 million, warns the Institute, adding that the number of cancer-related deaths is set to climb to 18.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what exactly is this dreaded disease? Well, according the NCI, cancer is when some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8925032"&gt;  &lt;p id="8925032" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/karolina-grabowska-rwYCGpywwJQ-unsplash-6860ed46cbc2c__700.jpg" alt="Hand pouring amber liquid into glass with ice, illustrating tobacco anything never concept related to health advice" title="Hand pouring amber liquid into glass with ice, illustrating tobacco anything never concept related to health advice"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Former fellow of the National Cancer Institute here—I hate to tell you this but it’s alcohol.

Human cells grow and multiply to form new cells as the body needs them. But sometimes things go wrong and abnormal or damaged cells grow and multiply when they shouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These cells may form tumors, which are lumps of tissue. Tumors can be cancerous or not cancerous (benign)," the NCI says. Another term for cancerous tumors is malignant tumors. And while many cancers form solid tumors, cancers of the blood, like leukemias, generally don't do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8925030"&gt;  &lt;p id="8925030" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/getty-images-LkNtMwoccz8-unsplash-685e7d4812f88__700.jpg" alt="Doctor with stethoscope reviewing notes on clipboard while consulting a patient, highlighting tobacco health risks advice." title="Doctor with stethoscope reviewing notes on clipboard while consulting a patient, highlighting tobacco health risks advice."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Oncology nurse here. I would never skip recommended cancer screenings, and I would never ignore weird unexplained symptoms (sudden weight loss, blood coming out your butt, ongoing abdominal pain, excessive bleeding or bruising, odd skin lesions, swollen lymph nodes that aren’t related to acute illness). It’s heartbreaking when people ignore symptoms and don’t get diagnosed until the cancer is too advanced for treatment to be helpful. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, I’m a big fan of sunscreen.

This is when cancerous tumors spread into, or invade, nearby tissues and travel to distant places in the body to form new tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Benign tumors do not spread into, or invade, nearby tissues. When removed, benign tumors usually don’t grow back, whereas cancerous tumors sometimes do," the NCI site explains. "Benign tumors can sometimes be quite large, however. Some can cause serious symptoms or be life-threatening, such as benign tumors in the brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, who is at risk of getting cancer?

Don’t smoke, don’t drink alcohol, don’t be overweight, wear sunscreen, minimise eating pork. Eat fibrous vegetables, foods containing turmeric, don’t hesitate to advocate for yourself when using health professionals, and if they’re tossing up whether to go gently or radically, always opt for radically because one day you’ll need the radical surgery anyway, and by then you’ll be less likely to fully recover. One other thing he swore by was having a social life because happy and supported patients last longer even when terminal. My old man died aged 80 of - the irony - a rare cancer with a genetic link, so my own advice is always to keep your MOT screening appointments with the GP.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1lhurwp/oncologists_of_reddit_whats_something_that_you/mz84hzf/" target="_blank"&gt; LycheeMangoJamun &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/asian-woman-doctor-encouragement-and-supportive-to-cansor-patient-after-consult-and-examine-in-clinic-hospital-health-ideas-concept-XLrxzXw1c_E" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9296-16/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the NCI, cancer is a genetic disease, meaning it's caused by changes to genes that control the way our cells function, how they grow and they divide. The site explains that these genetic changes happen for various reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be due to errors that occur as cells divide, or because of damage to DNA caused by harmful substances in the environment (like tobacco, alcohol or the ultraviolet rays from the sun).

The number of people who developed cancer because of something they were exposed to while serving is just mind-blowing (camp lejeune, asbestos in the navy, the tar pits, agent orange, etc etc etc)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Always recommended:&lt;br&gt;-keep your primary care informed about your family history of cancer (and other conditions, but that's not our focus here) because it may give you access to earlier or enhanced screening&lt;br&gt;-Screenings (mammogram, colonoscopies, prostate, skin)&lt;br&gt;-Exercise (30 min of cardiovascular exercise three times a week is correlated with a lower breast cancer risk)&lt;br&gt;-keep a healthy body weight (too much and the risk for uterine, colon, breast cancer and more increases)&lt;br&gt;-fiber (reduces risk of colon cancer)&lt;br&gt;-sunscreen (basal cell carcinoma is the most common cancer in the world)&lt;br&gt;-talk to your doctor if you're experiencing any ongoing unexplained symptoms, especially weight loss, fatigue, blood rectally or unexpected vaginally, pain, new lumps/bumps/skin lesions, new/changing moles, ongoing diarrhea/constipation (two week rule can help distinguish a random symptom from something that's more concerning) - I like to tell patients it's probably not cancer, but with your family history, talk to your doctor and make sure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My biggest advice: do what you can to improve your lifestyle and do the screenings to hopefully catch diagnoses that are out of our control.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1lhurwp/oncologists_of_reddit_whats_something_that_you/mz9txy1/" target="_blank"&gt; genetic-counselor &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9296-40/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8925031"&gt;  &lt;p id="8925031" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/getty-images-tWdVrG8pe4w-unsplash-685e7dda8970a__700.jpg" alt="Young girl smiling while getting sunscreen applied, promoting healthy habits and avoiding tobacco use for better health." title="Young girl smiling while getting sunscreen applied, promoting healthy habits and avoiding tobacco use for better health."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Not an oncologist, but I’m a radiation therapist, so I treat cancer patients every day. Obviously there are lifestyle habits you should avoid because they are linked to certain cancers or considered risk factors associated with certain cancers. That being said, one hard truth I’ve learned in the my years of doing this job is cancer really doesn’t discriminate. If it comes for you, it comes for you. I’ve treated 11 month old babies with brain tumors, a woman who never smoked a cigarette or had a drink in her life and did not have the BRCA gene and got cancer in not one but both breasts11 years apart- both primaries and not related to the other, triathletes with leukemia…it’s an evil and unfair disease. Now I’m in a specialized field where I only treat skin cancers with a superficial treatment machine, so I see less death and despair. My best piece of advice is WEAR SUNSCREEN and get your moles and spots checked. Health insurance typically covers a yearly total skin check at a dermatologist. .&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1lhurwp/oncologists_of_reddit_whats_something_that_you/mz8tvz1/" target="_blank"&gt; DAFFODIL0485 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-close-up-of-young-mother-applying-and-sunscreen-lotion-to-her-daughter-people-skin-protection-safety-sunbathing-in-hot-day-tWdVrG8pe4w" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9296-3/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers account for an estimated 48% of all cancers diagnosed in men in 2025," &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics#:~:text=Cancer%20is%20among%20the%20leading,related%20deaths%20to%2018.2%20million." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;reads&lt;/a&gt; the NCI's &lt;em&gt;"Cancer Statistics"&lt;/em&gt; page.

If you get any unusual symptoms such as lethargy, swollen glands, pain, weight loss, night sweats, a cough that won’t go away etc go get a simple blood test. If you’re bloated, have abdomen or back pain, changes in urine colour, headaches that persists, breathing changes, get an Xray/CT/ultrasound. If your GP dismisses you and doesn’t investigate at all… go get a better GP. The amount of patients that have been diagnosed late have usually been to their GP a few times and not had any tests performed.

One promising solution involves cytokines, natural proteins that stimulate your immune system to attack cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, conventional cytokine therapies have significant limitations. Scientists from &lt;a href="https://www.rice.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rice University&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Baylor College of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; are overcoming these hurdles by developing tiny implants that produce cytokines directly at tumor sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="understanding_cytokines_and_their_challenges"&gt;Understanding Cytokines and Their Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cytokines act as messengers in your immune system, triggering responses that fight infections or cancers. Specifically, interleukin-2 (IL-2) boosts the activity of immune cells called T cells, critical for destroying cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;A team of Rice University bioengineers—Amanda Nash, Omid Veiseh, and Samira Aghlara-Fotovat—partnered with Dr. Bryan Burt of Baylor College of Medicine to lead the collaboration.

Yet, traditional methods involve high doses of IL-2 injected intravenously, causing dangerous side effects such as vascular leak syndrome. This condition results in fluid buildup damaging vital organs like your &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/ozempic-successfully-treats-kidney-disease/"&gt;heart and kidneys&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, IL-2 rapidly disappears from your bloodstream, meaning high doses are necessary to fight tumors effectively. Repeated high doses often trigger your immune system to produce antibodies against the treatment itself, further reducing its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_new_approach_cytokine_factories"&gt;A New Approach: Cytokine Factories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome these drawbacks, researchers developed "cytokine factories"—microscopic beads loaded with thousands of engineered cells that naturally produce IL-2. Each bead, just 1.5 millimeters wide, continuously delivers IL-2 directly to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-discover-why-lungs-are-so-prone-to-developing-cancer/"&gt;tumor sites&lt;/a&gt;, significantly reducing systemic side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In studies published in journals like &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abm1032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Clinical Cancer Research&lt;/a&gt;, researchers implanted these cytokine-producing beads next to tumors in mice with ovarian, colorectal, and mesothelioma cancers. Remarkably, ovarian and colorectal tumors vanished within days. In mice with aggressive mesothelioma—a cancer of the lung lining often caused by asbestos exposure—over half the tumors disappeared using only the implants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more impressively, when cytokine factories were combined with checkpoint inhibitor drugs targeting proteins like PD-1, every mesothelioma tumor treated disappeared completely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bryan Burt, chief of Baylor’s Division of Thoracic Surgery, highlighted the significance, stating, "It's very hard to treat &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/eating-green-bananas-can-lower-your-risk-of-cancer-by-over-60/"&gt;mesothelioma&lt;/a&gt; tumors in mice, just as it is in humans. Our data show regional delivery produces very effective treatment responses.

IL-2 concentrations in these localized treatments remain about 100 times higher than in your bloodstream. This method maintains therapeutic effects without causing widespread toxicity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a clinical trial with &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/major-discovery-identifies-the-cause-of-ovarian-cancer/"&gt;ovarian cancer&lt;/a&gt; patients receiving IL-2 directly into the peritoneal cavity, side effects were significantly reduced compared to traditional treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amanda Nash, a Rice University graduate student involved in developing the cytokine factories, emphasized the platform's potential: "From the beginning, our objective was to develop a platform therapy useful for multiple immune disorders or cancers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="clinical_trials_and_future_directions"&gt;Clinical Trials and Future Directions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encouraged by these results, researchers are rapidly moving toward human trials. A spinout company, &lt;a href="https://avengebio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Avenge Bio&lt;/a&gt;, has secured FDA approval to start trials for ovarian cancer patients later this year. Additionally, researchers are preparing trials targeting mesothelioma and other lung cancers spreading within the chest cavity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Omid Veiseh, a Rice bioengineer leading this research, described the upcoming clinical plans: "In the next couple of months, they expect to begin treating patients with these IL-2 cytokine factories." Meetings with the FDA have already laid groundwork for these promising trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond cancer, Veiseh and colleagues received an &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; grant to explore cytokine implants for heart attack recovery.

Tests involving nonhuman primates showed the implants triggered strong &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-t-cell-protein-discovery-stops-autoimmune-diseases-in-their-tracks/"&gt;immune responses&lt;/a&gt; without toxic effects. Pharmacokinetic modeling—used to predict how the therapy works in humans—also indicated the treatment should translate successfully to clinical use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such precise control over dosage and duration addresses longstanding challenges of cytokine therapy, promising fewer complications and better patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_versatile_therapy_platform"&gt;A Versatile Therapy Platform&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cytokine factories represent a major breakthrough in cancer immunotherapy. By delivering cytokines directly to tumors at controlled rates, they harness your body's immune system effectively while minimizing harmful side effects. This approach could revolutionize treatments for multiple cancer types, &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/pecans-found-to-improve-cholesterol-diet-quality-and-lower-heart-disease-risk/"&gt;improving quality of life&lt;/a&gt; and survival rates for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As clinical trials begin, researchers remain hopeful this innovative treatment could soon become a reality for many patients.

							&lt;p data-start="319" data-end="559"&gt;There’s something incredibly frustrating about being exhausted, crawling into bed, and then… staring at the ceiling for hours. Or waking up at 2:47 a.m. for the third night in a row and wondering if this is just how life is going to be now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="561" data-end="690"&gt;For many people over 70, getting through the night without interruption feels like a luxury. But it’s not necessarily inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="692" data-end="918"&gt;Yes, age brings changes to sleep cycles, hormone levels, and even how our bodies regulate temperature. But what we often forget? Some of our evening habits—seemingly harmless ones—might be the very things sabotaging our sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="920" data-end="971"&gt;Let’s talk about the six culprits I see most often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="978" data-end="1017"&gt;1. Falling asleep in front of the TV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1019" data-end="1230"&gt;We’ve all done it—curled up with a good show after dinner and nodded off halfway through. In fact, it can feel like a comforting bedtime ritual. But there’s a reason sleep specialists strongly advise against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1232" data-end="1519"&gt;TVs (and phones and tablets) emit blue light, which interferes with melatonin, the hormone that regulates your internal clock. Even with your eyes half-closed, your brain is still registering those flickering lights and unpredictable sound spikes—keeping your mind in a semi-alert state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1521" data-end="1780"&gt;Not only that, but falling asleep on the couch often means your body doesn’t fully relax. Your head might be tilted at a weird angle. Your back unsupported. Your sleep shallow. Then, when you finally get up to go to bed, your body treats it like a full reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1782" data-end="2015"&gt;I used to tell myself it “didn’t count” if I just dozed for 20 minutes in the recliner. But I started tracking my sleep with a basic monitor, and sure enough—on TV nights, I had way more interruptions and grogginess the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2017" data-end="2232"&gt;So if TV is part of your routine, that’s fine. Just time it to end at least 30 minutes before bed. Use that final half hour for something lower stimulation—like listening to calm music or reading with soft lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2239" data-end="2285"&gt;2. Snacking too late—even if it’s “healthy”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2287" data-end="2359"&gt;Let me be clear: this isn’t about strict food rules or late-night guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2361" data-end="2650"&gt;This is about your body’s digestive system still working overtime when the rest of you wants to power down. Late-night snacking—especially on things like dark chocolate, yogurt, trail mix, or even fruit—can spike blood sugar or trigger wakefulness just as your body is trying to wind down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2652" data-end="2922"&gt;Here’s something many people don’t realize: digestion slightly raises your core temperature. And one of the signals your body relies on for sleep is a natural drop in temperature. So a late-night snack, even a small one, can throw off that signal and delay deeper sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2924" data-end="3146"&gt;As Dr. Shelby Harris, author of &lt;em data-start="2956" data-end="2998"&gt;The Women’s Guide to Overcoming Insomnia&lt;/em&gt;, has noted, “&lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/is-it-bad-to-sleep-right-after-eating-8419928?.com"&gt;Digestion can disrupt sleep&lt;/a&gt;, especially when you lie down too soon after eating. It’s best to finish eating 2–3 hours before bedtime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3148" data-end="3350"&gt;I once got into a habit of eating a banana with almond butter around 10 p.m. because I thought it was “healthy fuel.” Turns out, even that mild snack was enough to keep my sleep shallow and interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3352" data-end="3556"&gt;If you &lt;em data-start="3359" data-end="3363"&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; need a little something, keep it light and easy to digest. A warm herbal tea, a small piece of whole grain toast, or a slice of avocado can help settle you—without overstimulating your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3563" data-end="3616"&gt;3. Having that one extra glass of wine “to unwind”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3618" data-end="3765"&gt;Alcohol is a common go-to for relaxation, especially in the evening. And yes, it can make you feel drowsy at first. But sleep-wise? It’s deceptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3767" data-end="4016"&gt;Alcohol messes with REM sleep—that stage where your brain does the emotional and memory processing. And it tends to wear off a few hours after you fall asleep, leading to &lt;em data-start="3938" data-end="3959"&gt;rebound wakefulness&lt;/em&gt;—which is that sudden 2 a.m. alertness you can’t explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4018" data-end="4177"&gt;The reason? As your body metabolizes the alcohol, your nervous system becomes more active again, causing light sleep, vivid dreams, or frequent bathroom trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4179" data-end="4341"&gt;Sleep doctor Michael Breus puts it bluntly: “Alcohol is the&lt;a href="https://www.sleep.com/sleep-health/tart-cherry-juice-benefits?.com"&gt; number one sleep aid in the world&lt;/a&gt;—and also one of the worst things you can do for your sleep quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4343" data-end="4597"&gt;Instead of relying on that nightcap, try something that mimics the ritual but doesn’t interfere with your sleep: a warm cup of tart cherry juice (which contains melatonin), a magnesium-rich cocoa tea, or even just a mindful breathing practice before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4599" data-end="4712"&gt;And if you do have a glass of wine or cocktail with dinner, just keep it early—at least 3–4 hours before bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4719" data-end="4755"&gt;4. Obsessively checking the clock&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4757" data-end="4791"&gt;This one sneaks up on a lot of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4793" data-end="4987"&gt;You wake up in the middle of the night, glance at the clock, and suddenly you’re doing math. &lt;em data-start="4886" data-end="4987"&gt;It’s 2:46… okay, if I fall asleep in the next 20 minutes, I can still get 4 hours before the alarm…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4989" data-end="5076"&gt;Before you know it, you’re wide awake, irritated, and now anxious about &lt;em data-start="5061" data-end="5066"&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5078" data-end="5310"&gt;This is called &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/how-to-sleep-better-good-nights-sleep-lpw6vfskn?&amp;amp;region=global"&gt;sleep performance anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s something I see often in people who used to be “good sleepers” but find their patterns changing with age. The more we try to force sleep—or monitor it—the more elusive it becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5312" data-end="5481"&gt;As Dr. Guy Meadows explains, “Clock-watching increases anxiety, which is one of the main enemies of sleep. You begin to fear being awake, and that fear keeps you alert.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5483" data-end="5711"&gt;Try this instead: remove visual cues. Cover your bedside clock or turn your phone face-down. If you wake up, resist the urge to check the time. Remind yourself that rest—&lt;em data-start="5653" data-end="5679"&gt;even if not fully asleep&lt;/em&gt;—is still valuable to your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5713" data-end="5860"&gt;Some nights you’ll still wake up. That’s okay. But by not adding pressure, you’re giving your mind a chance to ease back into sleep more naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5867" data-end="5912"&gt;5. Having heavy conversations after dinner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5914" data-end="6187"&gt;Evening might feel like the natural time to talk things through—especially if you live with someone and the house finally gets quiet. But your nervous system doesn’t know the difference between a stimulating debate and an emotional argument. Either way, it kicks into gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6189" data-end="6440"&gt;I’ve been there. One minute I’m catching up with a friend or my spouse about something that happened during the day. The next thing I know, we’re deep in a serious conversation about finances or health fears… and my brain is now buzzing with cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6442" data-end="6552"&gt;It doesn’t always feel stressful in the moment. But your body still registers those discussions as activating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6554" data-end="6687"&gt;And when you mix that with aging-related changes in cortisol regulation, it creates the perfect recipe for fragmented, anxious sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6689" data-end="6954"&gt;Not every serious conversation can be perfectly timed. But where you can, shift those talks to earlier in the day. Or write down what you want to say and revisit it in the morning. That way, your mind isn’t left chewing on unresolved stress as you try to drift off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6961" data-end="7003"&gt;6. Staying too sedentary during the day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7005" data-end="7076"&gt;This one surprised me when I first started digging into sleep research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7078" data-end="7219"&gt;We often think of sleep issues as something to fix &lt;em data-start="7129" data-end="7139"&gt;at night&lt;/em&gt;. But a key part of deep sleep comes from how we move—or don’t—during the &lt;em data-start="7213" data-end="7218"&gt;day&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7221" data-end="7463"&gt;If your body isn’t getting enough physical activity, it doesn’t build up sufficient &lt;em data-start="7305" data-end="7321"&gt;sleep pressure&lt;/em&gt; (that biological drive that helps you fall into deep rest). And when you do lie down, you may fall asleep lightly but struggle to stay there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7465" data-end="7611"&gt;As the National Institute on Aging puts it, “Regular physical activity can help you &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/exercising-for-better-sleep?.com"&gt;fall asleep faster&lt;/a&gt;, stay asleep longer, and feel more rested.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7613" data-end="7824"&gt;This doesn’t mean high-intensity exercise or exhausting routines. For many people over 70, things like gentle yoga, gardening, housework, tai chi, or even a couple of 10-minute walks a day can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7826" data-end="7993"&gt;I’ve seen people improve their sleep just by switching their morning routines to include 10 minutes of movement after breakfast. It’s about consistency, not intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7995" data-end="8131"&gt;Sleep loves rhythm. And when your body has a full, steady rhythm of movement during the day, it’s more likely to settle deeply at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8138" data-end="8155"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8157" data-end="8300"&gt;Sleep isn’t just about rest—it’s one of the most important levers we have for cognitive health, mood stability, and overall vitality as we age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8302" data-end="8534"&gt;So if you find yourself waking up often, lying awake for hours, or feeling groggy despite spending eight hours in bed—it may be time to zoom out and look at what’s happening in those two to three hours before you turn out the light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8536" data-end="8745"&gt;Try cutting one habit at a time. Track what works. Maybe it’s the wine. Maybe it’s the 10 p.m. bowl of granola. Maybe it’s something you hadn’t even noticed—like the conversation you’re replaying in your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8747" data-end="8936"&gt;Sleep hygiene isn’t a one-size-fits-all formula. But most of us can get better sleep not by adding more, but by gently removing the habits that sneak in over time and chip away at our rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8938" data-end="9009" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""&gt;A peaceful night is possible. You just might have to make space for it.&lt;/p&gt;
