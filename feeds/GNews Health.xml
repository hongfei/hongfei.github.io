                                        &lt;p&gt;In the world of complicated fitness plans, there is one exercise that never goes out of style - walking. There is a new walking routine going viral these days. 6-6-6 walking routine has been making rounds on social media lately, and for the right reasons. This simple exercise can help you keep yourself fit, primarily because it helps you shed the extra kilos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is no shortage of fitness challenges on social media, the 6-6-6 walking routine has gained traction. Here's everything you need to know about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is The 6-6-6 Walking Routine? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/666-walking-trend-weight-loss" rel="noindex,nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Healthline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the 6-6-6 walking routine is a workout that involves "walking for 60 minutes, either at 6 a.m. or 6 p.m. It additionally includes a 6-minute warm-up at a slow pace to help you ease into walking and a 6-minute cool-down to aid in recovery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a workout, the 6-6-6 routine is more like a lifestyle shift that activates your metabolism, promotes heart health, and aids in weight management - all while being gentle to your joints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-personalisation---lifestyle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;em&gt;&lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" rel="noindex,nofollow"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; states that at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week is required to stay healthy, which includes moderate-intensity workouts such as brisk walking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is a great exercise and can help reduce mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression, as per &lt;em&gt;Healthline&lt;/em&gt;. It is also believed that it can help you lose weight, control blood pressure levels, increase energy levels, boost memory, strengthen bones, and reduce the chances of developing chronic diseases such as diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it may offer benefits, make sure you check with your doctor before you incorporate a new workout regimen in your routine.&lt;/p&gt;

found a direct link between exposure to wildfire smoke and a sharp rise in dementia diagnoses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings raise new concerns about the long-term neurological impacts of worsening air quality fueled by increasingly severe wildfires. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, about 42 percent of Americans over 55 are expected to develop dementia, with annual cases &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14279053/Americans-dementia-disease-underestimated.html"&gt;projected to nearly double from 514,000 in 2020 to one million by 2060&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers pinpointed wildfire smoke as especially harmful because it contains tiny toxic particles known as PM2.5, microscopic pollutants roughly 30 times thinner than a human hair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike typical city smog or car exhaust, t&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14765103/air-quality-canada-wildfires-michigan-minnesota-wisconsin.html"&gt;hese particles can enter the bloodstream &lt;/a&gt;and travel to the brain, causing inflammation that increases the risk of memory loss and cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PM2.5 particles can also weaken the blood-brain barrier, the brain's protective shield, making it vulnerable to damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14907953/air-quality-emergency-new-york-michigan-minnesota-illinois-vermont.html"&gt;Amid one of the most intense wildfire seasons on record&lt;/a&gt;, over 4,000 fires scorching nearly 200,000 acres in California as of mid-July 2025, this threat is growing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A new study reveals that wildfire smoke, is directly linked to a sharp rise in dementia diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wildfire smoke is an unpredictable and highly toxic mix of burned vegetation, plastics, metals, and chemicals from destroyed homes and vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It forms at higher temperatures and lingers longer in the air, making it far more damaging per microgram than pollution from factories or traffic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study found that a mere one-microgram increase in wildfire-related PM2.5 per cubic meter of air raises the risk of a dementia diagnosis by 21 percent over three years, nearly 20 times the risk posed by the same amount of PM2.5 from other pollution sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Holly Elser, neurologist and lead author from the University of Pennsylvania, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6048497/California-wildfire-smoke-set-cause-lung-issues-nationwide.html"&gt;said, 'Air pollution from wildfires now makes up more than 70 percent of total PM2.5 on poor air quality days in California.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These findings highlight the urgent need for stronger wildfire prevention policies and better smoke mitigation strategies.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To measure long-term exposure, researchers combined satellite data with ground air quality monitors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, focused on cognitively healthy individuals over 60 and controlled for income, smoking, health conditions, and race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As wildfires worsen, experts warn that addressing this silent threat is critical to protecting brain health for millions of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" data-gramm="false"&gt;By mid-July 2025, over 4,000 fires had already burned nearly 200,000 acres in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also found the worst health effects in low-income and minority communities, groups more likely to live in high-smoke areas and less likely to have access to indoor air filtration or protective equipment like N95 masks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Joan Casey, a senior author of the study and assistant professor in the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences at the University of Washington, Seattle: 'These findings underscore that clinical and health policies seeking to prevent dementia-associated disparities should include efforts to reduce exposure to long-term wildfire and non-wildfire PM2.5.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For decades, pollution has been linked to heart and lung disease, but this study adds to growing evidence that it also harms the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Claire Sexton of the Alzheimer's Association, said: 'We've thought about pollution as a lung and heart issue for decades, but now we are seeing its effects on memory, cognition, and aging, and it's deeply troubling.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As wildfire seasons stretch longer, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-11426259/Americas-growing-wildfire-crisis-lead-wave-health-issues-years-come-heres-why.html"&gt;sometimes from May through December, and heatwaves worsen&lt;/a&gt; across the western US, scientists warned that the neurological impact of poor air quality could be the next major public health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended staying indoors on days when the Air Quality Index (AQI) hits 100 or higher, using high-efficiency furnace filters (rated MERV 13 or above), and wearing certified N95 masks if outdoor exposure is unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These warnings come as the overall risk of dementia continues to rise nationwide. A separate study published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://archive.is/TmLlJ#selection-1135.0-1147.448"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt; estimated a 42 percent lifetime risk of developing dementia after age 55, with rates especially high among Black Americans.

							&lt;p&gt;The cat who changed everything arrived during the second year of lockdown, when touch had become dangerous and algorithms determined who we could love. Tom found her—a tortoiseshell with one white paw—behind a dumpster in Queens, brought her home to the apartment he shared with Sarah, and named her Mochi. Within a week, she'd chosen Sarah completely, definitively, with the kind of certainty that dating apps promise but never deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Tom kneels on their kitchen floor at 6 AM, holding salmon treats in one hand and speaking in the high-pitched voice we reserve for creatures we desperately want to love us back. Mochi sits perfectly still, green eyes locked not on him but on the doorway where Sarah will eventually appear. When she does—hair messy, still in pajamas—the cat transforms. Stone becomes water. Mochi flows between Sarah's legs, purring like something mechanical and necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"She hates me," Tom says, not for the first time, dropping the rejected treats back in the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah scoops up Mochi, who immediately nestles into her collarbone. "She doesn't hate you."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we all know what Tom knows: in a world where we swipe through faces hoping for mutual selection, where algorithms sort us into desirable and undesirable, where even our cats seem to have standards we can't meet, rejection hits different now. Mochi has made her choice with the kind of absoluteness that no amount of data science can replicate. And it wasn't him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The algorithm of the heart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started collecting these stories after Tom first told me about Mochi, and they're everywhere once you start looking. The golden retriever at my local dog park who walks past his owner to follow a stranger who resembles his first human. My neighbor's African grey parrot who learned thirty words from their daughter but remains silent when anyone else approaches. The therapy dog who, despite training that should make him love everyone equally, spends every free moment beside one particular resident at the nursing home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want simple explanations: whoever feeds the pet becomes the favorite, or animals prefer whoever spends the most time with them. But the evidence tells a different story. Tom feeds Mochi every morning. He plays with her, cleans her litter box, paid the vet bills for that eye infection last spring. By any algorithmic measure—time invested, resources provided, care demonstrated—he should be her chosen person. Yet Mochi waits by the door each evening for Sarah, who works sixty-hour weeks and sometimes doesn't get home until after the cat's bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes this particularly resonant now is how it mirrors our broader cultural moment. Young adults navigating dating apps report that rejection sensitivity—the tendency to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and intensely react to rejection—has become a defining feature of modern romance. We've gamified love, turned it into a series of binary decisions, yes or no, swipe left or swipe right. But animals don't swipe. They just know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom tells me he's started thinking of Mochi's preference as "analog rejection"—no ghosting, no mixed signals, no "it's not you, it's me." Just clear, consistent choice. "In a weird way, it's almost refreshing," he says. "At least I know where I stand."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The biology of being chosen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what actually happens when Mochi sees Sarah: both of their brains release oxytocin, the same hormone that bonds mothers to infants. When researchers at Azabu University in Japan studied &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1261022"&gt;dog-human interactions&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered this interspecies oxytocin loop—mutual gazing increased the hormone in both parties by up to 300%, creating what scientists call a "positive feedback loop" of attachment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But oxytocin isn't just about creating bonds; it's about creating &lt;em&gt;selective&lt;/em&gt; bonds. &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1322868111"&gt;Research from Duke University's Canine Cognition Center&lt;/a&gt; found that when dogs were given oxytocin, they didn't become indiscriminately affectionate. Instead, the hormone made them more discerning, increasing their preference for people who matched their energy and emotional state. Female dogs, in particular, showed heightened selectivity—choosing to gaze longer at their owners while becoming more wary of strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This selectivity operates below conscious awareness. A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93922-1"&gt;2021 study comparing pet dogs with pack-living dogs and wolves&lt;/a&gt;revealed that only household pets showed oxytocin spikes during human interaction. Despite being hand-raised by humans, pack animals maintained their own social hierarchies. The difference? Pet dogs live embedded in our daily rhythms, sharing our schedules, our spaces, our emotional weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom's anxiety about being rejected—his tentative approaches, his slight tension when he reaches for Mochi—may actually be pushing her toward Sarah's calmer presence. Studies of attachment in shelter animals show that &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5451941/"&gt;cats and dogs are remarkably attuned to human stress signals&lt;/a&gt;, often preferring people whose cortisol levels are lower. The science suggests our pets aren't just choosing who they like best; they're choosing who makes them feel most regulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I used to think I was doing everything right," Tom says. "But maybe trying so hard was exactly what I was doing wrong."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The certainty crisis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah works in user experience design, building the invisible architectures that guide our choices online. When I ask her about Mochi's preference, she laughs. "At work, we spend millions trying to predict and influence user behavior. We A/B test button colors, optimize conversion funnels, build machine learning models to anticipate what people want before they know they want it. Then I come home to this cat who decided within three days that I was her person, based on... what? My smell? The way I didn't try too hard? Some ineffable cat algorithm we'll never decode?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She's touching on something profound about our current moment. Dating app algorithms now sort potential matches based on everything from facial symmetry to linguistic patterns in our profiles—while claiming to connect people based on deeper compatibility. The very platforms designed to reduce the uncertainty of romantic connection have instead amplified it. Every match might be the algorithm manipulating you. Every rejection might be the code deciding you're not optimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mochi's choice feels different precisely because it's illegible to our optimization-obsessed age. There's no API for a cat's affection, no way to hack your way into being chosen. This illegibility feels like resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During lockdown, when everyone's cortisol levels were spiking, this regulatory function became even more crucial. Pets weren't just companions; they were co-regulation partners. And like all intimate relationships, the match had to be right. Chemistry, even between species, can't be forced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The privilege of rejection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend who works at a Brooklyn shelter tells me the saddest stories involve returns. "Someone adopts a dog, expecting instant love, and when the dog bonds with their roommate or their kid instead, they bring it back. As if the animal failed some test." She pauses. "The weird thing is, these are often the same people who complain about dating apps being superficial. They want authentic connection but can't handle when authentic connection doesn't choose them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's a darker edge to these dynamics that becomes visible when you look across economic lines. Research on pet ownership during economic hardship reveals that financially stressed pet owners are more likely to risk their own health and safety for their animals, especially when the bond is strong. The same connection that provides comfort can become a vulnerability when resources are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom and Sarah can afford to find Mochi's rejection amusing, even endearing. They have the economic cushion to treat it as a quirky household dynamic rather than a source of genuine distress. But for someone who's lost everything else—job, home, human relationships—being rejected by the creature you've saved can hit different. The very intensity of human-animal bonds means they carry real stakes, and those stakes aren't equally distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I volunteer at the shelter sometimes," Tom tells me. "You see people who have nothing, whose dog is everything to them. If that dog preferred someone else? I don't think they could laugh it off like I do."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learning from the unchosen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months after our first conversation, something has shifted in Tom and Sarah's apartment. Tom no longer approaches Mochi with treats and desperate hope. He simply exists in the space, reading on the couch while she sits on Sarah's lap. And sometimes—not often, but sometimes—Mochi walks across the couch to sniff his book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I stopped trying to make her love me," Tom says. "I figured if I rescued her, gave her a good home, that should be enough. Even if she picked Sarah as her person."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony is that this acceptance has actually improved their relationship. Without the pressure of Tom's expectations, Mochi has begun to show small signs of acknowledgment—a slow blink here, a brief head bump there. Research on feline behavior suggests that cats are more likely to approach humans who ignore them, a phenomenon that &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6826447/"&gt;Japanese researchers call the "cat paradox"&lt;/a&gt;. She'll never be his cat the way she's Sarah's cat, but she's beginning to recognize him as part of her chosen person's pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift in Tom's approach mirrors something larger about how we might navigate connection in an algorithmic age. "I've stopped taking it personally," he tells me. "Like, genuinely stopped. And weirdly, that's made me think differently about online dating too. Some matches won't text back, some cats won't choose you, and that's just... how choice works."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beyond the algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories I've collected reveal patterns that resist datafication. The elderly woman whose cat hides from everyone except the grocery delivery person who reminds him of his first owner. The couple whose dog chose their neighbor, leading to a joint custody arrangement that became a friendship none of them expected. The child whose hamster will only eat when she's in the room, a preference so specific it reorganized the family's entire dinner routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These choices create what Sarah calls "desire paths"—the routes worn by actual use rather than planned design. In UX, desire paths show where users actually want to go, regardless of where designers thought they should go. Mochi's preference carved a desire path through their household, reorganizing the emotional landscape in ways no amount of planning could have predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent neuroscience research suggests these preferences might be encoded at levels we're only beginning to understand. A &lt;a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-022-04199-1"&gt;2023 study on interspecies attachment&lt;/a&gt; found that animals form mental maps of their social world as complex as our own, with preferred individuals occupying privileged positions in their cognitive geography. When Mochi chose Sarah, she wasn't just selecting a food provider—she was mapping her emotional universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The gift of arbitrary love&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is what we're actually seeking when we talk about authentic connection: not the guarantee of being chosen, but the reality of choice itself. In a world where algorithms increasingly mediate our relationships, where machine learning tries to predict compatibility based on data points, the arbitrary certainty of an animal's preference feels like resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom and Sarah's apartment has become a living experiment in acceptance. Mochi still waits by the door for Sarah. She still purrs louder when Sarah holds her. But she also now acknowledges Tom as part of her territory, someone worthy of the occasional head bump, the rare slow blink that cat behaviorists call a "kitty kiss."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You know what's changed most?" Tom reflects. "I'm not performing for her anymore. I'm just... here. And apparently, that's enough for her to occasionally remember I exist."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This opacity might be the real gift our pets offer us. In an age of radical transparency, where our preferences are tracked, stored, analyzed, and sold, the mystery of animal choice remains uncolonized by data. We can't A/B test our way to a cat's affection or optimize our way into a dog's heart. We can only be present, patient, and open to the possibility that love—real love—doesn't always choose us back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pets in our homes are running ancient software on hardware refined by millions of years of evolution. When Mochi chose Sarah, she wasn't making a decision based on optimization or compatibility scores. She was responding to something older than algorithms, deeper than data, more mysterious than any machine learning model we've yet built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that's why these stories of animal favoritism captivate us now more than ever. They remind us that in a world of manufactured connections and predicted preferences, some choices remain wild. Arbitrary. Absolute. Even if we're not the ones chosen, we get to witness choice itself—pure, inexplicable, and certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time you see a pet clearly playing favorites, resist the urge to take it personally. Instead, marvel at what you're witnessing: millions of years of evolution culminating in this precise moment, when one small mammal looks at one specific human and says, in all the ways they can: "You. It's you."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if it's not you, there's something profound in being present for that choosing—in seeing love declare itself, mysterious and sure, in a world that's forgotten what certainty feels like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Mediterranean diet helps support healthy aging and longevity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top foods dietitians recommend include leafy greens, low-fat dairy, beans, nuts and fish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women over 50 should eat plenty of calcium, vitamin D, protein, fiber and omega-3 fats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For women over 50 looking to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8055902/healthy-habits-to-help-you-live-longer/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support long-term health and longevity&lt;/a&gt;, the Mediterranean diet offers a delicious, sustainable way of eating based on whole, nutrient-dense foods. “I can say from both personal and professional experience that what we eat in our 50s—and beyond—matters more than ever. These are the years when we start to feel the effects of hormonal shifts, bone loss and changes in muscle mass and metabolism,” says &lt;a href="https://www.lizshealthytable.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Liz Weiss, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. She emphasizes the importance of not just living longer, but living better, which includes feeling strong, sharp and energized throughout the years. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately, the Mediterranean diet has been linked to a longer, healthier life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It centers around minimally-processed plants, healthy fats and plenty of fiber.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-leafy-greens"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Leafy Greens &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Leafy greens—such as spinach, kale, arugula, lettuce and chard—are powerful foods for brain and heart health. “The MIND Diet, which combines the Mediterranean and DASH eating patterns, ranks leafy greens as one of its top food groups for cognitive protection,” says Weiss. She points to a 2018 study showing that older adults who ate 1–2 servings of leafy greens daily experienced slower cognitive decline—equivalent to being 11 years younger than those who rarely ate them.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The authors credit the brain-supporting benefits of leafy greens to their rich nutritional profile, including a wide range of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://realnutritionnyc.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Amy Shapiro, MS, RD&lt;/a&gt;, adds, “rich in calcium, vitamin K, magnesium and antioxidants, leafy greens are important for maintaining bone strength and reducing inflammation.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately, leafy greens are easy to add to your diet. Weiss recommends &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7899673/kale-spinach-smoothie/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blending baby spinach into smoothies&lt;/a&gt;, adding arugula to sandwiches and grain bowls and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8037286/super-green-pasta/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;making pesto with kale&lt;/a&gt; for a flavorful topping on fish or pasta. Shapiro suggests sautéing greens with garlic and lemon for a quick side dish, or using them as the base for any salad or adding to soups, omelets and grain bowls.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-beans"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Beans  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are a cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet and offer many health benefits—such as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7939797/the-top-mediterranean-foods-for-better-blood-sugars/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better blood sugar regulation&lt;/a&gt;, a healthier gut and heart and increased longevity—thanks to their rich fiber and nutrient content.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In societies like the Blue Zones—five regions around the world, including parts of the Mediterranean, where people often live past 100—beans are a daily staple, adds Weiss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “These humble pulses are packed with plant-based protein, iron, potassium and fiber, which helps to reduce LDL cholesterol and supports digestive regularity,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are also an excellent way to boost fiber intake—something most people fall short on. Their fiber supports a healthy gut and keeps blood sugar steady. Because they’re digested slowly, beans produce a lower glycemic response and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-reduce-insulin-resistance-for-better-blood-sugar-8750433" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;improve insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;. The fiber and protein in beans make them especially filling, which can support weight maintenance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Shapiro emphasizes the importance of getting enough of both, as digestion and muscle health become more important with age.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To add more beans to your diet, try canned varieties—they’re versatile, budget-friendly and convenient. Weiss recommends draining and rinsing canned beans to reduce sodium by up to 40%, making them a quick and heart-smart option. “Add chickpeas to grain bowls or salads, stir black beans into soups or tacos or puree white beans into dips and sauces for extra creaminess and nutrition,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-cottage-cheese-or-low-fat-strained-greek-style-yogurt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Cottage Cheese or Low-Fat Strained (Greek-Style) Yogurt &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Nearly half of women over 50 have some form of low bone mass,” says Weiss. After menopause, declining estrogen levels can accelerate bone loss, increasing the risk of osteoporosis—a condition where bones become weaker and more prone to fractures.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To support bone health, both Weiss and Shapiro recommend foods that offer a combination of calcium and protein, which are key components of strong, healthy bones. Two excellent low-fat options within the Mediterranean diet are strained (Greek-style) yogurt and cottage cheese. For example, one cup of Greek yogurt offers about 20 grams of protein and 220 mg of calcium, while one cup of cottage cheese provides 24 grams of protein and 227 mg of calcium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shapiro enjoys &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-protein-upgrade-for-your-morning-toast-11681776" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cottage cheese on toast&lt;/a&gt; with sliced tomatoes and fresh pepper, with berries and nuts or as a substitute for sour cream or mayo in recipes. Weiss suggests using strained (Greek-style) yogurt or cottage cheese in smoothies, as a base for savory dips or in breakfast parfaits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-nuts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Nuts  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another Mediterranean staple, nuts are valued for their rich flavor and impressive nutrient profile, making them a delicious and healthy addition to your diet. “Nuts offer healthy fats, fiber and plant-based protein,” says Weiss. “They also provide vitamin E (a potent antioxidant linked to cognitive health), magnesium (important for bone health), and, in the case of walnuts, plant-based omega-3 fats,” says Weiss. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond their nutrient content, nuts can also support weight management—a common challenge with age. In fact, one study found that higher nut consumption was associated with lower body fat, likely due to increased satiety.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, given their high-calorie content, it’s important not to overdo it. Weiss recommends consuming a small handful (around one ounce) of nuts daily. “Sprinkle them onto leafy green salads, stir into cooked oatmeal, or finely chop and mix with breadcrumbs to create a crisp, flavorful coating for baked chicken or fish. Toasting them first really enhances flavor,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-fatty-fish"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Fatty Fish &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fatty fish, a major star of the Mediterranean diet, can reduce your risk of cognitive decline and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7920294/foods-to-eat-every-day-for-brain-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support brain health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fatty fish are a top source of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, especially EPA and DHA. These fats are “linked to better brain function, reduced inflammation and lower risk of cardiovascular disease,” says Weiss. However, “women do not get enough omega-3s,” Shapiro adds, emphasizing the need to make these fats a regular part of the diet. That’s why Weiss recommends that women include SMASH fish—salmon, mackerel, anchovies, sardines and herring—at least twice a week to help meet their omega-3 needs. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “They also provide vitamin D, which is crucial for calcium absorption,” Shapiro adds. Together, these nutrients support strong, healthy bones and can be challenging to get through diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To add more fatty fish to your diet, visit a local seafood market for the catch of the day or try convenient, budget-friendly canned varieties that are just as nutritious.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Mediterranean diet is a great way for women over 50 to promote long-term health. It includes foods like leafy greens, beans, low-fat dairy, nuts and fish, which provide key nutrients for this stage of life—such as calcium, vitamin D, fiber, protein and omega-3 fatty acids. They’re also accessible and convenient choices. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shapiro reminds us that, “Consistency in your food choices matters more than perfection. Eating well isn’t about restriction, it’s about making smart, nourishing choices most of the time that fit into your life and support how you want to feel and function every day.” She adds, “Don’t underestimate the power of hydration, regular movement and sleep.

People in coastal areas tend to live longer than the national average, while those in urban areas near inland rivers or lakes may live slightly shorter lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why is the ocean different from inland water?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Coastal areas offer milder temperatures, better air quality, more recreation, and higher income—all of which support longevity. In contrast, inland urban waterways are often linked to pollution, poverty, and flood risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are rural areas near water any different?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Rural residents near water appear to gain some health and lifespan benefits, though not as consistently as coastal dwellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study shows that living near the ocean may be linked to a longer life—while living near inland rivers or lakes in urban areas may actually shorten it. Researchers analyzed data from over 66,000 U.S. census tracts and found coastal residents live, on average, at least a year longer than the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benefits may be tied to cleaner air, better weather, and increased physical activity near coastlines, while inland water areas—especially in cities—were associated with pollution, poverty, and increased health risks. The findings suggest not all “blue spaces” are equal when it comes to your lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longevity Boost:&lt;/strong&gt; Coastal residents may live one year longer than the U.S. average.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urban Inland Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; City dwellers near rivers or lakes may have &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; life expectancy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environmental Divide:&lt;/strong&gt; Air quality, temperature, and socioeconomic conditions likely explain the difference.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Living within miles of the ocean breeze may be linked to a longer life, but you shouldn’t count on the same benefits if you live in a riverside city, suggests a recent study.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from The Ohio State University analyzed population data — including life expectancy — in more than 66,000 census tracts throughout the U.S. and compared it based on proximity to waterways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their study was published online in the journal &lt;em&gt;Environmental Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A correlation between longer life expectancy and water was clear for those who live within about 30 miles of an ocean or gulf. But for those who live in urban settings and near an inland body of water larger than 4 square miles, the opposite was true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rural residents who live near water may also reap some lifespan advantages, according to the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, the coastal residents were expected to live a year or more longer than the 79-year average, and those who lived in more urban areas near inland rivers and lakes were likely to die by about 78 or so. The coastal residents probably live longer due to a variety of intertwined factors,” said lead researcher Jianyong “Jamie” Wu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis suggested that milder temperatures, better air quality, more opportunities for recreation, better transportation, less susceptibility to drought, and higher incomes could all be contributors to a better outlook for coastal residents compared to those who live inland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the other side, pollution, poverty, lack of safe opportunities to be physically active and an increased risk of flooding are likely drivers of these differences,” said Yanni Cao, a postdoctoral researcher who worked on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most critical difference the researchers found is that coastal areas experience fewer hot days and lower maximum temperatures compared to inland water areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has found a connection between living near water and better health measures, including higher physical activity levels, lower obesity rates and improved heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That prompted Wu to wonder if there could be a link between “blue space” living and longer lives, and how that relationship might differ depending on the type of neighborhood people call home, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We thought it was possible that any type of ‘blue space’ would offer some beneficial effects, and we were surprised to find such a significant and clear difference between those who live near coastal waters and those who live near inland waters,” said Wu, an assistant professor of environmental health sciences at The Ohio State University College of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found a clear difference — in coastal areas, people are living longer,” said Wu, adding that the study is the first to comprehensively and systematically examine the relationship between various types of “blue space” and longevity in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cao said she was especially curious about how this data might provide insights into the trends in life expectancy in the U.S. compared to other wealthy nations. In the past several years, the U.S. experienced a sharper decline and a slower rebound in life expectancy than peer countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s likely that various social determinants of health, including complex environmental factors, that contribute to health inequities are playing a key role in the differences we saw,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ria Martins, a graduate student in public health, was also a co-author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this longevity and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e78495868982c9d6d6a7889492c9828392" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Misti Crane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://osu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Misti Crane – Ohio State University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2025.121981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Unveiling complexity in blue spaces and life expectancy&lt;/a&gt;” by Jianyong “Jamie” Wu et al. &lt;em&gt;Environmental Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unveiling complexity in blue spaces and life expectancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although growing evidence supports the positive impact of blue spaces on human health, research on their association with life expectancy remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examines the association between coastal and inland waters and life expectancy across 66,263 census tracts in the United States, incorporating socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic factors through multiple linear and multi-level regression as well as spatial regression models, supplemented by sensitivity analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that proximity to coastal waters is positively associated with life expectancy, whereas proximity to inland waters is negatively associated. We used the mutual information model to identify key factors contributing to these differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a comparative analysis of coastal and inland water environments, we found that longer life expectancy near coastal waters may be linked to more favorable environmental and socioeconomic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include milder temperatures, better air quality, enhanced recreational opportunities, improved transportation, lower drought susceptibility, and higher income levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The urban–rural analysis further reveals that proximity to coastal waters is positively associated with life expectancy in both settings, whereas inland waters show differing associations, being negative in urban areas and positive in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to examining these blue space patterns, this study also considers broader socioeconomic and environmental factors related to life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the importance of integrating blue spaces and other key environmental and socioeconomic factors into urban planning, residential development, and healthcare environment design to improve life expectancy and health equity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 12:36:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1Kci1QWFNXUmlYSWxYOHNjT3pscmxtc0FuMzk5QzV6UmVkcEJwalAtbjU3UlExZXRoWDRIWmEwVDlvOUVBX3FrNmM2bFlUMkFxRHYwTDM2N1plY0YyejB4ZUtnXzFwVmNYMkVsME1uaVoydw</guid></item><item><title>这种类型的癌症在所有女性中都在增加，但其中一组尤其面临风险- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxQOFJVMlpYS2MwREVNcUw3em1RR3JMUnhqRWd5WUhlbE9aN3o4bUZtWkFWbGdSM3hmeDF4OV90dV9iOVUyNDRGTUlUVm9vcUxQeUFGTlhNQWQ1UXFZN3VHcE1zODVlM3BqTEM5T01NWGR1QXpPLWl1LXVBbDA0OVlkalhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

This makes it crucial to understand the warning signs of this kind of cancer and who it commonly occurs in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s typically detected in post-menopausal women, so women after the age of menopause, after they’ve not had a cycle for greater than one year,” said Hoskins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Uterine cancer is most common in this population, which tends to be women over the age of 50. In women who have gone through menopause, the sign of uterine cancer is often post-menopausal bleeding, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If they suddenly start bleeding, they should call their gynecologist or their health care provider and say, ‘This is what’s going on,’ and that doctor, then, in turn, should see and examine the patient,” added Vaidya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pelvic pain or discomfort is also a red flag, Hoskins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Maskot / Getty Images/Maskot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The doctor may order testing to look at the uterus, such as an ultrasound, and will likely also do a biopsy on tissue from the uterus, said Vaidya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Those are the ways that, if someone’s having symptoms, that we can try to test and look for it,” Vaidya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The cancer isn’t as common in pre-menopausal women, but it can still happen, said Hoskins. Symptoms in this group include irregular heavy bleeding or bleeding between periods, Hoskins added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This doesn’t mean that any period irregularity or heavy bleeding is cancer, though, so, don’t panic, said Vaidya. There can be many common reasons for heavier or irregular periods such as fibroids or a polyp, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“But it does make sense for women to think about their body, to notice if there’s a change, and especially when we think of pre-menopausal women ... it is good, if you’re familiar with your normal [cycle] to then be able to report an abnormal [cycle],” Vaidya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certain people are at higher risk of uterine cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/jillhamilton/happy-ending-massage-for-women?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I’m A Middle-Aged Woman.

You could be eligible for genetic testing to see if you have Lynch syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People who have &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-signs_l_633d8874e4b04cf8f368e393" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PCOS, or polycystic ovary syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PCOS, or polycystic ovary syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, are also at higher risk, noted Vaidya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Create Image / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/dannicaramirez/doctors-share-human-body-mysteries?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:&amp;quot;It's Incredibly Hard To Diagnose&amp;quot;: Medical Professionals Are Revealing The Medical Mysteries That've Yet To Be Solved, And Some Of Them Might Surprise You;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;"It's Incredibly Hard To Diagnose": Medical Professionals Are Revealing The Medical Mysteries That've Yet To Be Solved, And Some Of Them Might Surprise You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Taking unopposed estrogen also puts folks at higher risk. Hoskins explained what that means: “Any woman with a uterus needs to have estrogen and progesterone — that helps counterbalance any type of effect on the endometrium,” Hoskins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s common for women to &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/in-depth/hormone-therapy/art-20046372" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:take hormone therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;take hormone therapy&lt;/a&gt; to counteract menopause symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I think most providers know that you need to not just prescribe estrogen, but estrogen and progesterone to protect the uterus, if they’re using any type of hormone replacement,” Hoskins noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you are prescribed hormone replacement pills, be sure to follow the directions from your provider, and don’t skip out on your progesterone medication, Hoskins added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black women, particularly, have higher rates of death from uterine cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; JGI/Tom Grill / Getty Images/Tetra images RF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Recent research &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article-abstract/34/7/1156/763042/Projected-Trends-in-the-Incidence-and-Mortality-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:out of Columbia University;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;out of Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; and published in the American Association for Cancer Research used current data and modeling tools to predict what uterine cancer rates and mortality may look like in 30 years — and it paints a bleak picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I thought it was scary,” said Hoskins. In 2050, it’s expected that uterine cancer incidence and deaths will increase. Uterine cancer cases are expected to &lt;a href="https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/uterine-cancer-rates-predicted-rise-especially-among-black-women" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increase by 50% in Black women in 2050;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;increase by 50% in Black women in 2050&lt;/a&gt; and 29% in white women when compared to 2018 data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Currently, “Black women may be diagnosed at the same rate as white women, but are two times more likely to die,” according to Hoskins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The exact reasons why Black women are at higher risk aren’t known, but Hoskins has a few ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; MementoJpeg / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahloewentheil/mundane-behaviors-impact-health?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:Medical Professionals Are Sharing "Mundane" Things That Actually Make So Many People Sick;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;Medical Professionals Are Sharing "Mundane" Things That Actually Make So Many People Sick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In endometrial cancer, there’s about eight different subtypes [and] Black women tend to have cancers that are more aggressive,” said Hoskins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Systemic racism could also be a reason — maybe the patient wasn’t heard by their doctor, Hoskins noted, or perhaps they didn’t have swift access to care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There are some things that I do think need to be studied more, but we should discuss it, and that may be use of relaxers ... as a potential risk,” said Hoskins, referring to recent research showing that the chemicals in hair-straightening relaxers &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/chemical-hair-products-cancer_l_63500ffae4b08e0e6089dd1a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:put folks at higher risk of uterine cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;put folks at higher risk of uterine cancer&lt;/a&gt;.

It is a weak estrogen, and fat cells don’t produce the balancing hormone progesterone at all. So for patients who are obese, who are over their ideal body weight, those patients will have estrone in their body that stimulates the lining of the uterus, and because they don’t have the balanced progesterone from those same fat cells over time, those are women that are at increased risk for developing this endometrial pre-cancer and endometrial cancers,” explained Vaidya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s important to note that obesity itself isn’t an indicator of one’s health, but there are cases, like this one, when it can impact chances of developing certain diseases. And in this case, Vaidya added that the more overweight someone is, the higher their risk is for uterine cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This all may sound scary, but understanding the risk factors and the signs of uterine cancer can help you take control of your health and know when to bring a specific issue to your doctor’s attention. &lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/uterine-cancer-rates-increasing-black-white-women_l_6880dea5e4b0f277db4544ae" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahloewentheil/trends-people-wont-partake-in?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:19 "Garbage" Modern Trends People Refuse To Partake In Despite Their Popularity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;19 "Garbage" Modern Trends People Refuse To Partake In Despite Their Popularity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alanavalko/unhinged-microfeminisms?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:&amp;quot;He Thinks This Is Hostile And He Is Correct&amp;quot; — Women Are Sharing The &amp;quot;Unhinged&amp;quot; Ways They Practice Microfeminism That Reaally Grind A Small Man's Gears;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;"He Thinks This Is Hostile And He Is Correct" — Women Are Sharing The "Unhinged" Ways They Practice Microfeminism That Reaally Grind A Small Man's Gears&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lizmrichardson/doctors-shocking-things-bad-for-your-health?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:17 "Bad" Habits That Are Seriously Harming Your Health, Straight From Doctors And Scientists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;17 "Bad" Habits That Are Seriously Harming Your Health, Straight From Doctors And Scientists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/jillianwilson/uterine-cancer-rates-increasing-women?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read it on BuzzFeed.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Read it on BuzzFeed.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Home</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 11:16:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9pS3FCRHdHWVE3ZGZ2eGc2Q3R5VjlwcUt1TS1IWWcwUWctM2FWUVhTakpfamRzQ3Z2RGRGajdVMVZtREMtMmxpamVYcE1JeVlnQkhkLUU4dTV1Z1EyS2ZNNzBQbWh5c3h1T1Y1SXI5TS1IbnBiMHdjTVpCN2xJUQ</guid></item><item><title>如果有人避免与您目光接触，他们可能在想这8件事（根据心理学） - VegOut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0wFBVV95cUxPLUpMZEJ2T0RFYnNEWVM2ZVVSN196SktqbEdNSGNDYk9EbzRkUzMwVkxtTzVCQXJLYWxUTl9QLUpGYmFvczlaMV9DQTJEUm9WTGdPTkNENzNGT0tKMlVfNnczdUx0a3ZqY2x6UF9LZEJBYWEtc2I4RVRmM1BvQ3lOS2NzNmI3UG5zOHl4Z2ZibGNCR2NlUnNEaU5laklwVVFZbWdaVXNkVUppa1pSdjZtSW5SZGVwZ05FRTJfY0pCRm03ek5SUjdOWDRlN3RNNEh6dTh3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found yourself in a conversation where the other person just won't look at you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they're staring at their phone, gazing out the window, or studying their shoes like they're the most fascinating thing in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unsettling, isn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your mind starts racing—Are they bored?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiding something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I say something wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think people who avoided eye contact were just being rude or disinterested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after diving into the psychology behind this behavior, I realized there's usually much more going on beneath the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, when someone can't meet your gaze, their brain is often working overtime—processing emotions, managing stress, or navigating complex social dynamics that have nothing to do with you personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding what's really happening in those moments can completely shift how you interpret these interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's explore the eight most common thoughts running through someone's mind when they're looking everywhere but at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They're feeling socially anxious about being judged&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever notice how some people seem to shrink away during conversations, their eyes darting anywhere but your face?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a good chance they're battling social anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted by researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/news/2023/04/why-avoid-my-gaze"&gt;Universiteit Leiden&lt;/a&gt;, people high in social anxiety avoid eye contact in real-life conversations to dial down feared negative evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it—when you're worried about being judged, direct eye contact can feel incredibly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's like opening a window to your soul when you'd rather keep the curtains drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their averted gaze isn't about you being intimidating or uninteresting. Instead, they're trying to create a buffer zone where they feel safer and less exposed to potential criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They're trying to hide a lie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that time you asked your teenager where they were last night and suddenly they became fascinated with the kitchen counter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, there's solid psychology behind this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that liars are more likely to avert their gaze, and forcing eye contact actually &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/let-their-words-do-the-talking/202009/3-simple-techniques-detect-deception"&gt;boosts lie detection&lt;/a&gt;—suggesting gaze avoidance is a sneaky self-protection move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone is being deceptive, maintaining eye contact feels risky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's like they instinctively know that their eyes might give them away, so they look elsewhere to maintain their story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everyone who avoids eye contact is lying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you notice this behavior combined with other signs like fidgeting or inconsistent details, their mind might be working overtime to keep their deception intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They're feeling ashamed or embarrassed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something particularly vulnerable about eye contact when you're carrying shame or embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about the last time you had to admit a mistake to someone, or when you were caught off-guard by a question about something you'd rather not discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your instinct was probably to look down or away, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shame has a way of making us want to hide, and avoiding eye contact is one of the most immediate ways to create that sense of concealment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's like their brain is saying, "If I can't see the judgment in your eyes, maybe it's not really there."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This response is deeply human and often automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone feels exposed or regretful about something, looking away becomes a protective mechanism—a way to maintain some dignity while they process their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They're showing you respect according to their cultural background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's something that completely changed my perspective on eye contact: what feels rude to you might actually be a sign of deep respect to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-cultural research found that in some East Asian and Caribbean cultures, sustained eye contact is &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2015/02/the-impact-of-making-eye-contact-around-the-world/"&gt;considered rude&lt;/a&gt;, so people avert their gaze to show respect—not disinterest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this the hard way during my corporate days when I misinterpreted a colleague's behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought she was being dismissive during our meetings because she rarely looked directly at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, I discovered that in her culture, maintaining eye contact with authority figures or during serious conversations was seen as confrontational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a humbling reminder that our social norms aren't universal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What feels like avoidance to you might actually be their way of honoring the conversation and showing you the utmost courtesy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the most respectful thing someone can do is look away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They're feeling overwhelmed by the intensity of the moment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes avoiding eye contact isn't about what someone is thinking—it's about what they're feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been in a conversation that felt too heavy, too emotional, or just too much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe someone was sharing deeply personal news, or you were having one of those heart-to-heart talks that cuts straight to the core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In moments like these, direct eye contact can feel like staring into a spotlight when you're already feeling exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emotional intensity becomes almost too much to bear, so looking away provides a necessary breather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not that they don't care about what you're saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it might be the opposite—they care so much that they need to create some emotional distance just to stay present in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it as their way of regulating their feelings so they can actually absorb what's happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They're distracted by something else entirely&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's be honest—sometimes the reason has nothing to do with psychology and everything to do with a wandering mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they're mentally rehearsing an important presentation they have later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps they're worried about a family situation or trying to remember if they locked the front door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe that notification sound from their phone completely derailed their train of thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a world full of distractions, and our brains aren't always great at compartmentalizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone's mind is elsewhere, maintaining eye contact becomes surprisingly difficult because they're not fully present in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't necessarily mean they don't value your conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might just mean they're human, dealing with the same mental juggling act we all face daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They need mental space to process something difficult&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever noticed how people look up at the ceiling when you ask them a tough question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or how they stare off into the distance when trying to remember something important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't absent-mindedness—it's actually their brain being incredibly smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiments showed that adults (and even 8-year-olds) look away when &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03195338.pdf"&gt;answering tough questions&lt;/a&gt; because averting gaze frees up mental bandwidth for problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of eye contact as mentally demanding. When someone is trying to work through a complex thought, calculate something in their head, or recall a specific memory, their brain needs all available resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking away is like closing unnecessary browser tabs on a computer—it frees up processing power for the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if someone breaks eye contact mid-conversation, they might just be giving your question the thoughtful attention it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. They're trying to maintain emotional boundaries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people avoid eye contact as a way of protecting their emotional space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might happen when they're going through something difficult and don't want to invite questions or concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe they're in a professional setting where they need to keep things business-focused rather than personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eye contact creates connection, but not everyone is ready for that level of connection in every moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking away can be their way of saying, "I'm here, I'm participating, but I need to keep some walls up right now."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not necessarily about rejecting you or the conversation. Instead, it might be about self-preservation—maintaining the emotional energy they need to get through their day without becoming too vulnerable or invested in every interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time someone avoids eye contact with you, take a deep breath before jumping to conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More often than not, their wandering gaze has absolutely nothing to do with you and everything to do with what's happening in their internal world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether they're managing anxiety, processing complex thoughts, or simply navigating their own cultural norms, there's usually a very human reason behind the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This awareness has completely changed how I approach these situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of feeling rejected or wondering what I did wrong, I try to extend a little grace and patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I'll even adjust my own approach—maybe I'll speak a bit more gently if I sense anxiety, or give them extra time to think if they seem to be wrestling with something difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the psychology behind eye contact avoidance doesn't just make us better communicators—it makes us more compassionate people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in a world where we're quick to misinterpret each other's actions, that's something we could all use a little more of.&lt;/p&gt;

And, again, if you’re high-risk or have concerning symptoms, get medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are several things you can do to stay healthy, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep yourself from getting infected, “wear a high-quality mask, like an N95, in crowded indoor places ... wash [your] hands regularly and make sure that the folks around [you] are feeling well,” Coles said, and added that if a loved one tells you they have the sniffles, consider rescheduling that get-together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before all of those preventative measures, make sure you have the latest COVID shot. “Vaccination is still, by far, the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones,” said Coles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who are at high risk of developing COVID can get a second dose of the current COVID vaccine to stay protected during the current summer increase in cases, Coles noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Only after I’ve guaranteed his anonymity — Jeff is not his real name — does he share the whole story: “I was in my early-to-mid-30s, and there was significant bleeding from my &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/12/the-year-i-spent-with-my-butt-out.html"&gt;butt&lt;/a&gt; after a bowel movement.” That had never happened before, and Jeff had no idea &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it was happening. Panicked, he raced to the ER. “They told me I had internal hemorrhoids and one had become inflamed,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7yrjy001o3b79ogibo4ls@published" data-word-count="187"&gt;In a sense, we all have hemorrhoids. The term refers to both the anal ailment and the anatomy it affects: the cushiony rings of veins that line the anal canal and swell and expand to prevent stool from leaking before we’re ready to release it. “You can also think of them like a gasket in an engine or a rubber ring in a water faucet,” says &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/sanghyun-a-kim"&gt;Dr. Sanghyun Kim&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of surgery at the Icahn School of Medicine and site chief of colon and rectal surgery at Mount Sinai. When hemorrhoids are taxed beyond their limit — from too much pressure — they swell &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much, bulging like a kinked hose. That’s when hemorrhoids become varicose veins in your butt (or just outside it). And they are ubiquitous. “I would say we are absolutely seeing an increased incidence in hemorrhoids,” says &lt;a href="https://weillcornell.org/feliceschnoll"&gt;Dr. Felice Schnoll-Sussman&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Jay Monahan Center for Gastrointestinal Health at NewYork-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine, who explained that since the recommended age for a first &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2021/11/president-kamala-harris.html"&gt;colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt; was recently changed from 50 to 45, more people are being diagnosed with them than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn9w016000m3b78wn4w51uz@published" data-word-count="85"&gt;Research shows that one in three people in America who undergo a colonoscopy are diagnosed with hemorrhoids and that hemorrhoids account for 4 million doctor’s-office and emergency-room visits annually. Doctors expect this number to continue to rise. It’s estimated that at least &lt;a href="https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/us-hemorrhoids-treatment-market-16261?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;$1.7 billion&lt;/a&gt; is spent on medical hemorrhoid treatments each year, a figure projected to increase another billion dollars by 2034. (In 2017, sales of Preparation H — which can temporarily ease hemorrhoid pain but does not solve the problem — totaled &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7075634/#R7"&gt;$136 million&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdnafm8t001n3b78bsd7giea@published" data-word-count="102"&gt;Given the nightmare health scenarios that bloody stool can portend (colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease), a diagnosis of hemorrhoids was a relief for Jeff. He vowed to stop reading on the toilet (which he’d done all his life and which he was told may have caused his hemorrhoids) and to eat more fiber and drink more water so as to strain less. A bowel movement should occur swiftly and effortlessly; some experts &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-long-should-it-take-you-to-have-a-bowel-movement"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; it should take no more than &lt;a href="https://www.healthpartners.com/blog/healthy-poop-chart/"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; minutes. Back before his Trump-toadying days, Dr. Mehmet Oz famously &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/02/04/the-operator"&gt;remarked&lt;/a&gt; that poop should hit the bowl “like a diver from Acapulco.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7yrm0001q3b79mpy0z2x0@published" data-word-count="232"&gt;Typically, this is where a hemorrhoid story ends. If your only symptom is occasional blood or intermittent discomfort, doctors often advise that after getting checked out, you wait for things to improve on their own, which they generally do. This is how things transpired for Lana (also not her real name) after she noticed “some minor itchiness and then a weird lump” along with “blood in my poop.” Her doctor told her, “Oh, you probably have hemorrhoids; if they don’t bother you, don’t worry about it.” She made some lifestyle changes, though she admits that toilet-scrolling remained a treasured pastime (“Because phones are interesting,” she tells me). Meanwhile, Jeff hewed to his doctor’s counsel: “Lots of fiber, lots of hydration. Just doing everything I could,” he says. But hemorrhoids are mercurial menaces — sometimes easily vanquished, sometimes not. Though Lana was lax and Jeff meticulous, her hemorrhoids resolved while his persisted, eventually causing him brutal pain on top of the bloody mess he would ashamedly clean up each time he moved his bowels. On Reddit, many others have shared their private ordeals with their own intractable hemorrhoids. “Is anybody else severely depressed because of these things?” one &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1liwi6x/anybody_else/"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; in r/hemorrhoid. Another answered, “It’s all I think about all day.” A woman going by u/misssorebutt &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/13d7gaf/hemorrhoids_are_ruining_my_life/"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; her hemorrhoids “the worst pain imaginable.” The title of her post is “Hemorrhoids are ruining my life.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7ys18001s3b79h1l7j1j1@published" data-word-count="69"&gt;Some reasons for this problem are becoming clearer. Many of us are doing our damnedest to let hemorrhoids flourish: We sit too much, eat too poorly, drink too little water, work out too hard, poop too aggressively, bidet too ferociously, and, perhaps most prevalently these days, stick around too long — chronically scrolling on the toilet is as surefire a path to hemorrhoids as one could hope to find.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7ys2e001t3b7992ith5nn@published" data-word-count="92"&gt;A 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/93-of-young-people-admit-to-using-their-phones-on-the-toilet-according-to-new-survey-301302005.html"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; revealed that 73 percent of people bring their phone with them into the bathroom; among respondents ages 18 to 29, that number climbed to 93 percent. While it’s possible that these people are just lugging their phones along for safekeeping, it seems unlikely given a more recent small &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/using-your-phone-on-the-toilet-may-dramatically-increase-risk-of-hemorrhoids"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;, which found that of the survey subjects who reported having hemorrhoids, 93 percent admitted to using their phones while on the toilet at least once a week. The correlation between increasingly ubiquitous toilet-based phone usage and hemorrhoid prevalence seems clear.&lt;/p&gt;

His hemorrhoids began to protrude, and he could no longer push them back. Jeff saw a specialist who attempted a rubber-band ligation, or RBL. For decades, this has been the most common — and, in many gastroenterology practices, the only — nonsurgical treatment for hemorrhoids. It’s a five-minute procedure in which a rubber band is placed at the base of a hemorrhoid, cutting off its blood supply to shrink it. Patients are often told that the procedure isn’t that painful since the rubber band is placed at a part of the hemorrhoid &lt;a href="https://oregansystem.com/online-guides/hemorrhoid-banding/"&gt;without any pain sensors&lt;/a&gt;. In practice, however, many patients report otherwise. (“I am in agony,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/he5s2r/so_much_pain_from_rubber_band_ligation/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; a post-RBL redditor. “Nothing is helping.”) Says Jeff, “He tried to band a couple of them to see how that would go, with the idea that possibly the rest could be banded as well. But the biggest one was too sensitive — I could feel it being pulled at, and it was painful. So the doctor said it wasn’t a good idea, and surgery was recommended.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7z85x002f3b792tzylcb0@published" data-word-count="85"&gt;Hemorrhoidectomies — in which hemorrhoids are excised, or, in a stapled hemorrhoidopexy, stapled to choke their blood supply — are effective &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/procedures/hemorrhoidectomy"&gt;95 percent &lt;/a&gt;of the time. But they have long suffered from a serious PR problem: It’s common knowledge that recovery is painful and long, lasting weeks. “I’ve been doing old-fashioned hemorrhoidectomies for 25 years,” says Kim. “And there is not too much we can do to make the pain better. It does hurt, no matter what we do, because it’s a very sensitive area.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7z85y002g3b796cflgwdx@published" data-word-count="67"&gt;For Jeff, recovery from surgery was far worse than he could have anticipated. It started out okay, he says, “because they give you a nerve block so you don’t feel much after.” But all good painkillers must come to an end, and once Jeff’s did, the full picture of what his anus had undergone became clear. “It’s incredibly agonizing to shit through an open wound,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7z85y002h3b79q5b4o161@published" data-word-count="142"&gt;To help with the pain, Jeff was given oxycodone, an opiate — a common side effect of which is constipation. This is how the task of defecating became downright life-threatening for him. When he finally had a bowel movement, his bleeding became profuse. Jeff’s wife ran out to buy adult diapers so the pair could go to the ER. It turned out that Jeff had &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6331745/#:~:text=12%E2%80%9315%5D.-,Delayed%20post%2Dhemorrhoidectomy%20bleeding%20(DPHB)%20is%20a%20rare%20but,risk%20factors%20associated%20with%20DPHB."&gt;delayed post-hemorrhoidectomy bleeding&lt;/a&gt;, which affects as many as 10 percent of patients and is more common in men. After a night in the hospital and a quick patch-up of his wound, he underwent blood tests over several months to monitor the severe anemia he suffered thanks to the blood loss. During this period, he was weak, easily fatigued. The surgery was in February; it took until June for Jeff to return to his normal level of activity.&lt;/p&gt;

But fresh avenues for treatment are emerging with some promising to be game-changing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7zo5r00353b79ag8q89n1@published" data-word-count="158"&gt;A newer procedure that Kim favors is &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/transanal-hemorrhoidal-dearterialization"&gt;transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization&lt;/a&gt;, in which a device is inserted into the anus to locate the artery feeding blood to your hemorrhoids, before another device is inserted to tie that artery off with sutures. “I’ve compared traditional hemorrhoidectomy to THD, and the return-to-work rate was 20 days for hemorrhoidectomy and only three with THD,” Kim says. But because THD can leave deflated skin dangling from the anus, causing cleanliness issues and irritation, Kim has added what he calls an “anal lift.” He uses a barbed tie popularly deployed in face-lifts in Korea, his mother country, called V-Loc sutures. “The sutures have tiny hooks on them with a one-way spike so that when the hook goes in, it won’t come out,” he says. “I can use that to decrease the prolapsed skin.” However, Kim explains, the procedure is sometimes denied by insurance companies for being either too experimental or more expensive than RBL.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7zo5s00363b79qjlaiwha@published" data-word-count="146"&gt;That’s a recurring theme I encountered while researching procedures beyond RBL and traditional hemorrhoidectomy: They exist, and they are well proven, but because they are neither familiar nor cheap, they present more challenges in terms of coverage. I spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/radiology/people/david-m-mauro/"&gt;Dr. David Mauro&lt;/a&gt;, a vascular surgeon in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, who often &lt;a href="https://healthtalk.unchealthcare.org/embolization-is-a-new-treatment-option-for-hemorrhoids/"&gt;performs&lt;/a&gt; a low-recovery hemorrhoid procedure known as hemorrhoid artery embolization. The procedure involves snaking a catheter through a tiny hole in the groin or wrist down to the artery feeding the hemorrhoid, then delivering typically a combination of tiny metal coils and particles into the blood vessel to block the hemorrhoid’s supply of blood. “There’s a significant subset of patients that recur after banding,” says Mauro, “or banding fails or is intolerable. And that’s where I think hemorrhoidal embolization has a role.” However, a failed banding is often a painful hurdle to clear.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7zo5t00373b79r9bovngu@published" data-word-count="147"&gt;A new medtech company is hoping to interrupt this pattern of muscling through banding and surgery before getting effective (but somewhat more experimental) treatment. For the past few years, a company called HemWell has sought to popularize what it describes as a “painless” outpatient procedure that has been approved for use by the FDA. Essentially, a low current from an electrode inserted into the anus causes nearby blood vessels to narrow, shrinking hemorrhoids within minutes. I ask &lt;a href="https://gi.md/reed-hogan-iii/"&gt;Dr. Reed Hogan III&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist at the GI Associates &amp;amp; Endoscopy Center in Madison, Mississippi, who has performed many Hemwellectomies, to tell me more. “While the patient is asleep,” he says, “the electrode is inserted, and its current creates a chemical reaction within the hemorrhoid blood vessel that shuts down the blood flow coming in but still allows blood to flow out. This decreases the size of the hemorrhoid.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7zo5u00383b79vpuplzcm@published" data-word-count="160"&gt;I ask Hogan if the procedure is really as remarkable as it seems: Patients are comfortably sedated, and supposedly the recovery time is nonexistent, while clinical efficacy (more than &lt;a href="https://www.dhcoftx.com/dhc-procedures/hemwell/#:~:text=Why%20choose%20to%20have%20a,sigmoidoscopy%2C%20depending%20on%20individual%20circumstances."&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt;) is apparently more predictable than in RBL (&lt;a href="https://heritagesurgicalgroup.com/rubber-band-ligation-bergen-county/"&gt;between 70 to 90 percent&lt;/a&gt;). “I think this is a paradigm shift for hemorrhoid treatment,” he tells me. “I think it should be offered in every GI clinic across the country because it’s so well tolerated by patients.” Hogan sings HemWell’s praises so profusely that I ask point-blank if he is being paid to spread its gospel. He assures me that he has not received a dime. He now performs Hemwellectomies on 90 percent of his hemorrhoid patients, and his father, also a gastroenterologist in the practice, is a fellow convert. “Normally I hate to use the term &lt;em&gt;painless&lt;/em&gt;, but in two years of doing these, I’ve had about five people need an Advil or a Tylenol,” the senior Hogan tells me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdn7zo5u00393b79gw7faq30@published" data-word-count="52"&gt;As with other nontraditional therapies, HemWell is theoretically covered by insurance but often only if you’ve exhausted the standard options. And if you don’t happen to live near a physician who’s using the procedure — I found only about a dozen across the country — you may have to stick with RBL.&lt;/p&gt;

A pregnant person’s blood volume &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content?contenttypeid=134&amp;amp;contentid=9#:~:text=Varicose%20veins%20occur%20when%20veins,the%20pelvis%2C%20altering%20blood%20flow"&gt;increases&lt;/a&gt; by as much as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/pregnancy/art-20045977"&gt;50 percent,&lt;/a&gt; which can enlarge those veins. Hormones released during pregnancy can relax the walls of their blood vessels, making them more susceptible to swelling. Pregnancy also causes constipation. Then there’s the final boss of anorectal straining, vaginal delivery, which leaves many new moms with hemorrhoids postpartum.&lt;/p&gt;

Her luck ran out when she became pregnant with her first child. “Before pregnancy,” she says, “I’d have a lump I’d barely pay attention to, and it would resolve itself. But during pregnancy, they got worse, and they’ve never gone away. They’re just hanging out” — literally and figuratively — “and they’re probably a permanent fixture, because no &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; am I having surgery.” Though Lana’s hemorrhoids are a nuisance when it’s time to wipe (“They make the topography more complicated,” she says), they still don’t hurt. For unknown thousands, this is the status quo: a lifelong anatomical annoyance one must learn to live around.&lt;/p&gt;

Timely treatment (albeit paid for out of pocket) increases the odds of avoiding surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

Few parts of the body are more freighted with taboo and disgust than the human anus. It is, after all, where poop comes out, poop being among the ultimate embodiments of &lt;em&gt;the abject &lt;/em&gt;— all the stuff, according to critical theory, that’s so horrifying and odious it has the power to disrupt the very social order if not hidden or contained. That’s a lot of pressure on one little ring of muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

However, what may seem minor or routine could, in fact, be an early sign of something far more serious: a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Early signs of a heart attack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Dinesh stressed that early detection and immediate intervention can dramatically improve outcomes of a heart-related ailment—yet this is often hindered by the vague or atypical ways symptoms present themselves, especially in younger populations. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/23/original/pexels-towfiqu-barbhuiya-3440682-14569658_1734957756809.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="All chest pain originates from the heart.

Gastrointestinal, muscular, or respiratory causes can also produce similar sensations. (Pexels)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Not every heart attack begins with crushing chest pain. In fact, many people, particularly women and those under 50, may experience subtler symptoms,” he stressed. He suggested some early signs to look out for:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discomfort or tightness in the chest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain that radiates to the arm, neck, jaw, or back&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unexplained fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cold sweats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling of light-headedness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some individuals may only feel a mild heaviness or pressure in the chest, which comes and goes. Because the pain is not always severe or continuous, it is frequently dismissed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Dinesh cautioned, “It is worth noting that not all chest pain originates from the heart. Gastrointestinal, muscular, or respiratory causes can also produce similar sensations. However, given the potential consequences, it is always safer to rule out a cardiac cause first.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He recommended simple diagnostic tools like an electrocardiogram (ECG), blood tests for cardiac enzymes, and non-invasive imaging, which can provide clarity within minutes. “The cost of ignoring symptoms far outweighs the time or effort involved in getting evaluated,” he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What causes a heart attack?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per Dr Dinesh, a heart attack, or myocardial infarction, occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is suddenly blocked, usually by a clot in one of the coronary arteries. This prevents oxygen from reaching the heart muscle, which can cause permanent damage or death if not treated promptly. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/07/29/550x309/2149485806_1753785122594_1753785131041.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Lifestyle risk factors—poor dietary habits, lack of exercise, high stress levels, inadequate sleep, and tobacco use—are significant contributors.

(Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Challenges faced in detecting underlying heart issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the Indian context, the challenge is compounded by rising cases of cardiovascular disease among younger adults. Lifestyle risk factors—poor dietary habits, lack of exercise, high stress levels, inadequate sleep, and tobacco use—are significant contributors,” Dr Dinesh explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, in urban India, a growing number of individuals in their 30s and 40s are being diagnosed with premature coronary artery disease. Many of them are unaware of their underlying risk, including conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or high cholesterol, per Dr Dinesh.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to him, another critical factor is delayed response. “Despite experiencing symptoms, people often choose to wait, hoping the discomfort will subside on its own. They may self-medicate with antacids or painkillers, misreading cardiac discomfort as acidity or muscle strain,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this delay can be fatal. “The initial hours after the onset of a heart attack—the so-called ‘golden hours’—are vital. The sooner a blocked artery is reopened, the better the chance of preserving heart muscle and avoiding complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Prevention is better than a cure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stressing that prevention is equally important, Dr Dinesh said that while some risk factors—such as genetics or age—cannot be changed, others can be actively managed. He suggests:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular health check-ups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining optimal blood pressure and blood sugar levels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cholesterol control&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Balanced nutrition&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quitting tobacco&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular physical activity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Effective stress management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even small, consistent changes in daily routines can help reduce the likelihood of future cardiac events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Awareness also plays a vital role,” Dr Dinesh added. “Understanding that heart disease can present differently in different people is crucial. Family members, caregivers, and peers should also be able to recognise the signs and encourage timely medical intervention.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Early symptoms are not always significantly visible. A feeling of unease, a vague pressure, or an unusual fatigue should not be underestimated, particularly if there are other coexisting risk factors,” the cardiologist cautioned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the end, Dr Dinesh stresses that chest discomfort should never be regarded casually. “While not every episode indicates a heart attack, the cost of inaction can be irreversible. In a condition where time is muscle, prompt medical evaluation is the most powerful tool for survival and recovery. If there is even a slight suspicion that symptoms may be cardiac in origin, seeking medical attention without delay can make all the difference. In cardiac emergencies, time is not just precious—it is life-saving. Let that be reason enough to never ignore what the body is trying to say,” he stated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Research suggests that walking quickly for just 15 minutes a day could slash the risk of suffering heart disease by up to almost 20 per cent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over a follow-up of just under 17 years, the researchers discovered that walking fast for as little as 15 minutes per day reduced the risk of all cause mortality by nearly 20 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/"&gt;American Journal of Preventive Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, they found the effect was most pronounced for cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Professor Wei Zeng, lead investigator and expert in lifestyle factors and diseases, fast walking could reduce cardiovascular mortality by improving how efficiently the heart works and reducing obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This style of exercise has previously been shown to increase &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14931757/juice-heart-attack-risk.html"&gt;VO2-max&lt;/a&gt; — a measure of how much oxygen the body can process during exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A high VO2 max is associated with better physical fitness and lower risk of cardiovascular disease, indicating that the body is efficiently extracting and using oxygen from the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Zeng concluded: 'Brisk walking offers a convenient, accessible and low-impact activity that individuals of all ages and fitness levels can use to improve general health and cardiovascular health specifically.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts, lead by Professor Lili Liu, lead author and trainee epidemiologist, are now urging health officials to encourage fast walking within all communities — especially those with limited access to healthcare — and address barriers to daily walking such as safety concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added: 'Public health campaigns and community-based programmes can emphasise the importance and availability of fast walking to improve health outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;NHS data shows a rise in the number of younger adults suffering from heart attacks over the past decade. The biggest increase (95 per cent) was recorded in the 25-29 year-old demographic, though as numbers of patients are low even small spikes can look dramatic &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Individuals should strive to incorporate more intense physical activity into their routines, such as brisk walking or other forms of aerobic exercise.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists, however, acknowledged&lt;span&gt; that because physical activity data was only collected at the beginning of the study, changes in activity levels could not be considered. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The paper also had some limitations, they said, including the fact daily walking levels were self-reported. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sedentary lifestyles in the UK, with Brits spending their workhours deskbound, then sitting in a train or car on their way home to sit down in front of the TV, have been estimated to kill thousands each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The WHO puts the annual global death toll from physical inactivity at around two million per year, making it in the running to be among the top ten leading causes of global death and disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physical inactivity has been long linked to health problems like cardiovascular disease as well contributing to health problems like obesity, itself linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and some cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases of heart attacks, heart failure and strokes among the under-75s had tumbled since the 1960s thanks to plummeting smoking rates, advanced surgical techniques and breakthroughs such as stents and statins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now, other factors such as slow ambulance response times for category 2 calls in England — which includes suspected heart attacks and strokes — as well as long waits for tests and treatment have also been blamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

While traditionally associated with muscles and the liver, glycogen appears to accumulate abnormally in neurons affected by Alzheimer’s and other tau-related disorders. Scientists found that this buildup may worsen neurodegeneration by disrupting how cells manage energy and oxidative stress. Their findings, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01314-w" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, suggest that breaking down glycogen could help protect neurons and offer a promising new direction for treating or preventing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurological condition that impairs memory, thinking, and behavior. It is the most common cause of dementia, especially among older adults. The disease is marked by two key biological abnormalities in the brain: plaques made of amyloid-beta protein and tangles made of another protein called tau. These protein accumulations disrupt normal cell function, leading to inflammation, cell death, and brain shrinkage over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite extensive research, effective treatments for Alzheimer’s remain elusive. Most drug development has focused on clearing amyloid or tau from the brain, with limited success. Many researchers now believe that other factors, such as energy metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress, may play a role in determining who develops the disease and how quickly it progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alzheimer’s disease, first identified over a century ago, remains one of the most challenging neurodegenerative conditions. Despite decades of research and numerous clinical trials aimed at targeting these aggregates, success has been limited,” said study author Pankaj Kapahi, a professor at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Surprisingly, many people with these protein buildups show little or no cognitive decline, and not everyone with hereditary risk factors develops the disease. This has led scientists to suspect that other overlooked factors may contribute to the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recent research has started to shine a light on the role of environmental and lifestyle factors—particularly diet—in shaping brain health. That question sparked our curiosity: could a rich diet influence the development of Alzheimer’s?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glycogen is the storage form of glucose, a sugar that serves as a vital source of energy. The liver and muscles contain most of the body’s glycogen, which is broken down when energy demands increase. The brain, though highly energy-dependent, contains only small amounts of glycogen, mainly in support cells called astrocytes. Neurons—the primary information-processing cells of the brain—have long been thought to store very little glycogen and to rely mainly on a continuous glucose supply from the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, recent studies have hinted that neurons might store more glycogen than previously thought, especially in disease states. The Buck Institute researchers were interested in whether abnormal glycogen metabolism might be a hidden driver of Alzheimer’s and related tauopathies, and whether correcting it could slow or prevent the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team used both fruit fly models and human stem cell-derived neurons to study tauopathies—diseases characterized by tau protein accumulation. In the fly experiments, they used genetic tools to overexpress human tau protein, including a mutant version linked to frontotemporal dementia. These flies developed signs of neurodegeneration, such as shortened lifespan, brain cell death, and structural damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared flies fed a normal, protein-rich diet to those fed a low-protein, calorie-restricted diet, known to extend lifespan in many species. They also tested the effects of drugs and genetic changes that promote glycogen breakdown. In parallel, they studied neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), including cells with two different tau mutations associated with dementia. These human neurons were grown in the lab and analyzed using fluorescent markers to assess glycogen accumulation, oxidative stress, and related metabolic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that tau-expressing neurons—both in flies and in human-derived cells—accumulated large amounts of glycogen. This buildup appeared to be linked to the tau protein itself, which physically interacted with glycogen and prevented its breakdown. The result was a toxic cycle: tau caused glycogen to build up, and the glycogen buildup made the tau accumulation worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers restored activity of an enzyme called glycogen phosphorylase (GlyP), which initiates glycogen breakdown, the effects were striking. In both flies and human neurons, breaking down glycogen reduced oxidative stress, lowered tau burden, and prevented cell death. It also extended the lifespan of tau-expressing flies by nearly 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than fueling energy production through glycolysis, the glycogen-derived glucose was diverted into the pentose phosphate pathway. This pathway produces antioxidant molecules like NADPH and glutathione, which protect cells from damage caused by reactive oxygen species. The researchers confirmed that oxidative stress levels dropped sharply in cells with active glycogen breakdown. Blocking this pathway erased the protective effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also found that dietary restriction increased glycogen phosphorylase activity through a well-known signaling mechanism involving cyclic AMP and protein kinase A. Treating flies with a drug that mimics this pathway had similar effects to calorie restriction, reducing cell death and extending lifespan. This may help explain why drugs used to treat diabetes and promote weight loss—such as GLP-1 agonists—show early signs of benefit in Alzheimer’s trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sugar metabolism in neurons is different from what was previously believed,” Kapahi told PsyPost. “We found that stored sugars in brain cells can help reduce reactive oxygen species—harmful byproducts of normal metabolism. However, when these sugars accumulate too much, they can bind to toxic protein buildups and make the condition worse. We identified a pathway that breaks down this sugar buildup in neurons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteomic and metabolomic analyses supported these findings. The researchers identified dozens of metabolic and mitochondrial genes affected by diet, tau, and glycogen metabolism. Importantly, they found similar changes in brain tissue from Alzheimer’s patients, including upregulation of enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using a fruit fly model, our team uncovered a powerful link between a rich diet and the progression of Alzheimer’s-like symptoms,” Kapahi explained. “Under the leadership of postdoctoral researcher Dr. Sudipta Bar, we made a fascinating discovery: neurons in Alzheimer’s patients accumulate an unusual amount of glycogen—a complex sugar molecule not typically found in large quantities in healthy brain cells. Because of its complex structure, glycogen can attach to toxic proteins and may accelerate their aggregation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even more intriguing, Dr. Bar found that neurons metabolize glycogen differently than other organs, hinting at a unique metabolic vulnerability in the brain. He also identified key upstream proteins and signaling pathways that may be harnessed to prevent or reverse this harmful process. This unexpected connection between diet, sugar metabolism, and protein aggregation opens exciting new avenues for Alzheimer’s research and potential therapies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the results are promising, the study has several limitations. Most of the experiments were conducted in fruit flies or lab-grown neurons, which do not fully replicate the complexity of the human brain. While human data were used for comparison, more work is needed to confirm whether glycogen metabolism plays the same role in living patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also unclear whether glycogen accumulation is a cause or a consequence of neurodegeneration, or whether it occurs early enough in the disease process to serve as a useful therapeutic target. Long-term studies in animal models and clinical trials will be needed to explore whether enhancing glycogen breakdown can slow cognitive decline or improve brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers plan to continue exploring how glycogen interacts with tau and other proteins, and whether certain diets or medications can modify this process. “Our long-term goal is to develop therapeutic strategies based on our findings,” Kapahi said. “In addition, we aim to explore the many questions this study has raised, such as: How does glycogen breakdown help rescue disease pathology? Which metabolic pathways are altered by glycogen breakdown? And how does glycogen bind to toxic proteins?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We would like to acknowledge the valuable contributions of Prof. Lisa Ellerby, Prof. Birgit Schilling, and Prof. Tara Tracy from the Buck Institute, as well as Prof. Nicholas Seyfried from Emory University, along with their lab members, for their support and collaboration in this study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01314-w" target="_blank"&gt;Neuronal glycogen breakdown mitigates tauopathy via pentose-phosphate-pathway-mediated oxidative stress reduction&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sudipta Bar, Kenneth A.

            Dr. Uri Manor feels like much of his early life was blessed by fate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0004356nkn8il11p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Born with genetic hearing loss that enables him to hear only about 10% of what others might, Manor was diagnosed at age 2, when he&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;happened to be living in Wichita, Kansas – the home of what he describes as “one of the most advanced schools for children with hearing loss, maybe in the world.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0005356nowbwihe1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It wasn’t clear if I would ever learn language, if I would ever be able to speak clearly,” said Manor, now 45. “So I was very lucky, really weirdly lucky, that we were living in Wichita, Kansas, at the time.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0006356nok6hh8o3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Working in Wichita with experts at the Institute of Logopedics, now called &lt;a href="https://foundation.wichita.edu/heartspring-and-wsus-cassat-clinic-will-be-neighbors-in-wichitas-downtown-healthcare-corridor/" target="_blank"&gt;Heartspring&lt;/a&gt;, Manor learned to speak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhueo1g0000356nbsh1q46w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That same sort of serendipity led Manor into an unexpected career studying hearing loss himself, first at the US National Institutes of Health and, now, leading his own lab at the University of California, San Diego, where his research into ways to restore hearing was supported by a major five-year NIH grant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhugjep0002356nazomgram@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But that’s where Manor’s luck ran out. His grant was terminated in May by the Trump administration as part of its policies targeting diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives; Manor’s funding had been awarded through a program that aimed to promote workforce diversity, for which he qualified because he has hearing loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhummlp0005356ns9rxc0uo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, Manor’s research is in limbo, like that of thousands of other scientists whose work is supported in large part by the federal government and who’ve been affected by grant terminations. And the halt comes as research into hearing loss, which affects as many as 15% of American adults and 1 in 400 children at birth, had recently shown signs of rapid advancement.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0007356nsdi059v7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was intense curiosity about the world that led Manor into a career in science, where early on, fate seemed to strike again. As a researcher at the &lt;a href="https://www.training.nih.gov/research-training/grads/gpp/institutional/jhu/" target="_blank"&gt;NIH and Johns Hopkins&lt;/a&gt; working toward his Ph.D., Manor hoped to find an adviser interested in how magnetic fields could influence cells – an obsession that stemmed from a fascination with animals’ ability to navigate using magnetic fields of the Earth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0008356nj8med8jg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was describing that to a physicist PI [primary investigator] at the NIH, and he goes, ‘Yeah, I can’t support that project, but what you’re describing sounds a lot like the hair cells of the inner ear. You should go talk to this PI, who studies hair cells,’” Manor recalled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhqnq9x00013b6n1q35497v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite spending much of his time at the &lt;a href="https://www.asha.org/public/who-are-audiologists/#:~:text=Audiologists%20are%20experts%20who%20can,that%20may%20need%20further%20evaluation." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;audiologist’s&lt;/a&gt; office, he said, “I’d never thought about the ear.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0009356nliz5veng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That PI, &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/about/staff/bechara-kachar" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Bechara Kachar&lt;/a&gt;, showed him microscope images of hair cells in the inner ear, which enable us to hear, and Manor remembers being stunned.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000a356n0subg9dg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I fell in love with the hair cell, these mysterious cells in our ear, because the system was so amazing, how it all comes together and how it all works,” Manor said. “I got goosebumps. I have hearing loss, and I never thought about studying it. But now I was in this room falling in love with this system. I was like, ‘What if this is like my destiny? What if this is what I’m supposed to be doing?’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000b356ng075x8fd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2023, Manor received his first R01 grant from the NIH, a major five-year &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/IIT2zo7phUKCNgF_giEmrA/project-details/10678569" target="_blank"&gt;award&lt;/a&gt; that would support his lab’s work on ways to restore hearing. Again, serendipity had struck; the R01 grant process is intensely competitive, &lt;a href="https://report.nih.gov/nihdatabook/category/10" target="_blank"&gt;funding&lt;/a&gt; only a fraction of the applications the biomedical research agency gets. Young researchers are advised to apply to research funding programs where they may have a unique edge, to improve their odds, Manor said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000c356n60j4n542@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There was one that seemed a perfect fit; he was encouraged by mentors to apply to a program at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders that aimed to promote workforce diversity. It was specifically &lt;a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DC-23-001.html" target="_blank"&gt;designed&lt;/a&gt; to support early-stage researchers “from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups,” such as people with disabilities. Manor qualified because he has “congenital severe-to-profound hearing loss,” he said. “It felt right.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000d356naec9q0cv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even at the time, Manor said, he acknowledged the risk that government initiatives supporting DEI may not always be popular. His biggest concern, though, was that he might not be able to renew his grant through the same program after its five years were up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000e356nejsbh74i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But his luck turned.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In late May, he received notification from the NIH that, only two years in, his five-year grant had been canceled. The reason: The Trump administration was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/business/dei-fcc-media"&gt;targeting&lt;/a&gt; programs promoting DEI.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000f356ne3m8i7h6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Research programs based primarily on artificial and non-scientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness,” the notice read. “It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize such research programs.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000g356npek7s02v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No more funding would be awarded, it continued, and all future years on the grant had been removed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000h356nl570g624@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “No one ever imagined that a grant could be canceled in the middle of an award period,” Manor said. “It might be naïve and incorrect, but when you get a five-year grant from the NIH, that’s a five-year contract, and you make plans based on five years. … That’s really kind of rocked our world.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpiwzt0000356n0krjh1dk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A spokesperson for the NIH told CNN: “The study itself has value, however unfortunately it was funded under an ideologically driven DEI program under the Biden Administration. In the future, NIH will review, and fund research based on scientific merit rather than on DEI criteria.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000i356nf7fd38ir@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manor spent the next two weeks sleeping two to three hours a night, writing new grant proposals to try to replace the lost funds. But the termination meant his lab had to stop experiments, some of which had taken years to set up. Manor took that measure in an attempt to avoid having to lay off&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;staff members – which he ultimately had to do as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000k356ns95o2jv2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hearing loss &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-hearing" target="_blank"&gt;affects&lt;/a&gt; more than 30 million people in the US, with prevalence rising as people age. Recently, the field has taken leaps forward, with trials of gene therapies, which deliver working copies of genes to make up for mutated ones that cause deafness, helping &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02874-X/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/positive-phase-12-clinical-trial-data-investigational-gene" target="_blank"&gt;hear&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000l356nq6vejrp7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re at the threshold of a brave new world, so to speak,” said &lt;a href="https://oto.hms.harvard.edu/people/charles-liberman" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Charles Liberman&lt;/a&gt;, a senior scientist and former director of the Eaton-Peabody Laboratories at Mass Eye and Ear, one of the largest hearing research laboratories in the world.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“It’s pretty incredible, the progress that’s been made in the last 10 or 15 years, on understanding what goes wrong in the ear and having a pretty good handle on what kinds of approaches might work to cure sensorineural hearing loss.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000m356n2rgs1c4m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Liberman anticipates breakthroughs in the next five to 10 years in slowing age-related hearing loss as well and, “perhaps farther in the future, to actually reverse age-related hearing loss.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000n356njlijry2s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Liberman said Manor – with whom he’s collaborated in the past – is contributing to the field’s advancements.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhprgq70017356n9wd2bqck@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He has not been in the field for terribly long, but he’s already made a big impression because of the incredible sort of computational approaches he takes to analyzing data from the inner ear,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000o356n59g2vmsm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “His grant got cut because it was a diversity initiative,” Liberman continued, “but Uri’s research is top quality, and I’m sure it would have been funded just on its own merit.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000q356ncg22t349@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manor’s was one of thousands of NIH grants cut by the Trump administration, amounting to almost $3.8 billion in lost funding, &lt;a href="https://www.aamc.org/media/83996/download" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Others canceled under the banner of combating DEI ideology include those focused on HIV, where researchers reported receiving notification &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/health/nih-science-funding-states-kff-health-news/index.html"&gt;identical&lt;/a&gt; to Manor’s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000r356n1r2qc5bi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But recently, Manor’s fortunes seemed to have changed again. A federal judge &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/16/health/nih-grant-cuts-ruling"&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; in June that it was illegal for the Trump administration to cancel several hundred research grants in areas including racial health disparities and transgender health. Manor’s is among the grants included, and he received notice that the funding should come through.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000s356nx80nda4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, he said he worries about whether that decision will hold through future court challenges. And he, like so many other scientists affected by the administration’s drastic cuts to research funding, warns about the effects on scientific progress.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000t356nigo265g9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “No matter what your political leanings are, you have a 1 in 400 chance of having a child with hearing loss,” he said. Anyone dealing with medical conditions “will benefit from the amazing advances of science and our biomedical research force.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000u356nd3ud7oj1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But he also emphasized the importance of recognizing that research like his is supported by taxpayers, some of whom “are struggling to pay their own bills, who are struggling to pay their kids’ doctors bills.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000v356nvsjqg36y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And some of their taxpayer dollars are coming to my lab,” he said. “That’s a huge responsibility and privilege, and we have to make sure we’re doing good with it. For me, that’s a really powerful motivating factor, and I would like to believe that we’re doing it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Dr. Uri Manor feels like much of his early life was blessed by fate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0004356nkn8il11p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Born with genetic hearing loss that enables him to hear only about 10% of what others might, Manor was diagnosed at age 2, when he&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;happened to be living in Wichita, Kansas – the home of what he describes as “one of the most advanced schools for children with hearing loss, maybe in the world.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0005356nowbwihe1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It wasn’t clear if I would ever learn language, if I would ever be able to speak clearly,” said Manor, now 45. “So I was very lucky, really weirdly lucky, that we were living in Wichita, Kansas, at the time.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0006356nok6hh8o3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Working in Wichita with experts at the Institute of Logopedics, now called &lt;a href="https://foundation.wichita.edu/heartspring-and-wsus-cassat-clinic-will-be-neighbors-in-wichitas-downtown-healthcare-corridor/" target="_blank"&gt;Heartspring&lt;/a&gt;, Manor learned to speak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhueo1g0000356nbsh1q46w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That same sort of serendipity led Manor into an unexpected career studying hearing loss himself, first at the US National Institutes of Health and, now, leading his own lab at the University of California, San Diego, where his research into ways to restore hearing was supported by a major five-year NIH grant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhugjep0002356nazomgram@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But that’s where Manor’s luck ran out. His grant was terminated in May by the Trump administration as part of its policies targeting diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, initiatives; Manor’s funding had been awarded through a program that aimed to promote workforce diversity, for which he qualified because he has hearing loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhummlp0005356ns9rxc0uo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, Manor’s research is in limbo, like that of thousands of other scientists whose work is supported in large part by the federal government and who’ve been affected by grant terminations. And the halt comes as research into hearing loss, which affects as many as 15% of American adults and 1 in 400 children at birth, had recently shown signs of rapid advancement.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0007356nsdi059v7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was intense curiosity about the world that led Manor into a career in science, where early on, fate seemed to strike again. As a researcher at the &lt;a href="https://www.training.nih.gov/research-training/grads/gpp/institutional/jhu/" target="_blank"&gt;NIH and Johns Hopkins&lt;/a&gt; working toward his Ph.D., Manor hoped to find an adviser interested in how magnetic fields could influence cells – an obsession that stemmed from a fascination with animals’ ability to navigate using magnetic fields of the Earth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0008356nj8med8jg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was describing that to a physicist PI [primary investigator] at the NIH, and he goes, ‘Yeah, I can’t support that project, but what you’re describing sounds a lot like the hair cells of the inner ear. You should go talk to this PI, who studies hair cells,’” Manor recalled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhqnq9x00013b6n1q35497v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite spending much of his time at the &lt;a href="https://www.asha.org/public/who-are-audiologists/#:~:text=Audiologists%20are%20experts%20who%20can,that%20may%20need%20further%20evaluation." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;audiologist’s&lt;/a&gt; office, he said, “I’d never thought about the ear.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t0009356nliz5veng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That PI, &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/about/staff/bechara-kachar" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Bechara Kachar&lt;/a&gt;, showed him microscope images of hair cells in the inner ear, which enable us to hear, and Manor remembers being stunned.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000a356n0subg9dg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I fell in love with the hair cell, these mysterious cells in our ear, because the system was so amazing, how it all comes together and how it all works,” Manor said. “I got goosebumps. I have hearing loss, and I never thought about studying it. But now I was in this room falling in love with this system. I was like, ‘What if this is like my destiny? What if this is what I’m supposed to be doing?’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000b356ng075x8fd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2023, Manor received his first R01 grant from the NIH, a major five-year &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/IIT2zo7phUKCNgF_giEmrA/project-details/10678569" target="_blank"&gt;award&lt;/a&gt; that would support his lab’s work on ways to restore hearing. Again, serendipity had struck; the R01 grant process is intensely competitive, &lt;a href="https://report.nih.gov/nihdatabook/category/10" target="_blank"&gt;funding&lt;/a&gt; only a fraction of the applications the biomedical research agency gets. Young researchers are advised to apply to research funding programs where they may have a unique edge, to improve their odds, Manor said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000c356n60j4n542@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There was one that seemed a perfect fit; he was encouraged by mentors to apply to a program at the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders that aimed to promote workforce diversity. It was specifically &lt;a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-DC-23-001.html" target="_blank"&gt;designed&lt;/a&gt; to support early-stage researchers “from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups,” such as people with disabilities. Manor qualified because he has “congenital severe-to-profound hearing loss,” he said. “It felt right.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000d356naec9q0cv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even at the time, Manor said, he acknowledged the risk that government initiatives supporting DEI may not always be popular. His biggest concern, though, was that he might not be able to renew his grant through the same program after its five years were up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000e356nejsbh74i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But his luck turned.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In late May, he received notification from the NIH that, only two years in, his five-year grant had been canceled. The reason: The Trump administration was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/business/dei-fcc-media"&gt;targeting&lt;/a&gt; programs promoting DEI.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000f356ne3m8i7h6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Research programs based primarily on artificial and non-scientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness,” the notice read. “It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize such research programs.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000g356npek7s02v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No more funding would be awarded, it continued, and all future years on the grant had been removed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000h356nl570g624@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “No one ever imagined that a grant could be canceled in the middle of an award period,” Manor said. “It might be naïve and incorrect, but when you get a five-year grant from the NIH, that’s a five-year contract, and you make plans based on five years. … That’s really kind of rocked our world.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpiwzt0000356n0krjh1dk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A spokesperson for the NIH told CNN: “The study itself has value, however unfortunately it was funded under an ideologically driven DEI program under the Biden Administration. In the future, NIH will review, and fund research based on scientific merit rather than on DEI criteria.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000i356nf7fd38ir@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manor spent the next two weeks sleeping two to three hours a night, writing new grant proposals to try to replace the lost funds. But the termination meant his lab had to stop experiments, some of which had taken years to set up. Manor took that measure in an attempt to avoid having to lay off&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;staff members – which he ultimately had to do as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000k356ns95o2jv2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hearing loss &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-hearing" target="_blank"&gt;affects&lt;/a&gt; more than 30 million people in the US, with prevalence rising as people age. Recently, the field has taken leaps forward, with trials of gene therapies, which deliver working copies of genes to make up for mutated ones that cause deafness, helping &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02874-X/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/positive-phase-12-clinical-trial-data-investigational-gene" target="_blank"&gt;hear&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000l356nq6vejrp7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re at the threshold of a brave new world, so to speak,” said &lt;a href="https://oto.hms.harvard.edu/people/charles-liberman" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Charles Liberman&lt;/a&gt;, a senior scientist and former director of the Eaton-Peabody Laboratories at Mass Eye and Ear, one of the largest hearing research laboratories in the world.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“It’s pretty incredible, the progress that’s been made in the last 10 or 15 years, on understanding what goes wrong in the ear and having a pretty good handle on what kinds of approaches might work to cure sensorineural hearing loss.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000m356n2rgs1c4m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Liberman anticipates breakthroughs in the next five to 10 years in slowing age-related hearing loss as well and, “perhaps farther in the future, to actually reverse age-related hearing loss.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000n356njlijry2s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Liberman said Manor – with whom he’s collaborated in the past – is contributing to the field’s advancements.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhprgq70017356n9wd2bqck@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He has not been in the field for terribly long, but he’s already made a big impression because of the incredible sort of computational approaches he takes to analyzing data from the inner ear,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000o356n59g2vmsm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “His grant got cut because it was a diversity initiative,” Liberman continued, “but Uri’s research is top quality, and I’m sure it would have been funded just on its own merit.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Manor’s was one of thousands of NIH grants cut by the Trump administration, amounting to almost $3.8 billion in lost funding, &lt;a href="https://www.aamc.org/media/83996/download" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Others canceled under the banner of combating DEI ideology include those focused on HIV, where researchers reported receiving notification &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/health/nih-science-funding-states-kff-health-news/index.html"&gt;identical&lt;/a&gt; to Manor’s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000r356n1r2qc5bi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But recently, Manor’s fortunes seemed to have changed again. A federal judge &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/16/health/nih-grant-cuts-ruling"&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; in June that it was illegal for the Trump administration to cancel several hundred research grants in areas including racial health disparities and transgender health. Manor’s is among the grants included, and he received notice that the funding should come through.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000s356nx80nda4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, he said he worries about whether that decision will hold through future court challenges. And he, like so many other scientists affected by the administration’s drastic cuts to research funding, warns about the effects on scientific progress.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000t356nigo265g9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “No matter what your political leanings are, you have a 1 in 400 chance of having a child with hearing loss,” he said. Anyone dealing with medical conditions “will benefit from the amazing advances of science and our biomedical research force.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000u356nd3ud7oj1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But he also emphasized the importance of recognizing that research like his is supported by taxpayers, some of whom “are struggling to pay their own bills, who are struggling to pay their kids’ doctors bills.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdhpkp2t000v356nvsjqg36y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And some of their taxpayer dollars are coming to my lab,” he said. “That’s a huge responsibility and privilege, and we have to make sure we’re doing good with it. For me, that’s a really powerful motivating factor, and I would like to believe that we’re doing it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0"&gt;They went to a Las Vegas conference this month that promised pathways to an “unlimited lifespan.” But at least two attendees left in ambulances and were hospitalized in critical condition, requiring ventilators to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0"&gt;The two women, who are recovering, fell ill after receiving peptide injections at a conference booth. The doctor who ran the booth was a Los Angeles physician specializing in “age reversal” therapies who did not have permission to practice medicine or dispense prescriptions in Nevada. Public health investigators are trying to determine if anyone else who attended the Revolution Against Aging and Death Festival experienced a similar illness.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0"&gt;The investigation comes as peptides grow in popularity, thanks in part to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s promotion of the amino acid chains as a way to fight aging and chronic disease. Since becoming Health and Human Services secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sODZSAuxTTw"&gt;Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sODZSAuxTTw"&gt; has vowed&lt;/a&gt; to end the Food and Drug Administration’s “&lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1849925311586238737"&gt;war on peptides&lt;/a&gt;” and other alternative health therapies. Kent Holtorf, the doctor overseeing the booth where the women became ill, also has called for less regulation of alternative therapies and has criticized the FDA for blocking compounds he sees as lifesaving.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0"&gt;Holtorf told ProPublica he is cooperating with the investigation. “Of course, I want to get to the bottom of it. But almost assuredly it will come out that it was not the peptides.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0"&gt;He said he became convinced the peptides weren’t the cause of the severe reactions after plugging everything he knows about the incident into an artificial intelligence app, which he said gave him a 57-page report that “basically says that it is impossible it was the peptides.” He refused to comment on what the report attributed the illnesses to.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0"&gt;“I don’t think it was the peptides, but I don’t want to try and push the blame and say it wasn’t us,” he said. “We are reassessing everything we are doing.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0"&gt;Holtorf acknowledged he is not licensed in Nevada but said he hired a practitioner who is and did not personally write prescriptions or administer therapies at his booth. “I knew what was going on but was not hands on,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0"&gt;He described the situation as “horrific” and “unacceptable” and said he’s “terribly sorry.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0"&gt;The FDA has approved dozens of peptide-based medications for treating serious health problems such as cancer, obesity and diabetes. But peptide therapies for anti-aging and regenerative health are largely made by compounding pharmacists who use peptide components to formulate drugs that aren’t commercially available or approved for that particular use. Compounded drugs are not reviewed for safety and efficacy by the FDA. The agency also has found “significant safety risks” with at least 18 of the most popular peptide compounding components.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0"&gt;“Anyone who undergoes any sort of medical treatment, no matter how benign, needs to be very wary that even the most benign intervention can have fatal side effects,” said Dr. Amy Gutman, a Florida emergency room doctor who speaks about metabolic research and ketogenic diets and appeared at RAADFest. “And if you are in a hotel and don’t have lifesaving equipment near you, then that is a risk you have to be aware of.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0"&gt;The two women, a 38-year-old from California and a 51-year-old from Nevada, received injections on July 13 at RAADFest, which is organized by an Arizona-based nonprofit that has built a community hoping to cheat death. According to a police report, both were injected at a booth run by Holtorf, who is licensed in California but not Nevada. Holtorf’s advocacy for alternative therapies has invited controversy in the past, including his criticism of the H1N1 swine flu vaccine in a Fox News interview in 2009. More recently, his practice was &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/warning-letters/covid-19-letter_to_holtorf_medical_group.pdf"&gt;advised by the Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt; to cease making claims on its website that his peptide therapies could treat or prevent COVID-19. Holtorf said he removed the claims from his website even though he still believes certain peptides can be beneficial in treating COVID-19 and other viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0"&gt;Both the Southern Nevada Health District and the Nevada Board of Pharmacy confirmed they are investigating what led to the hospitalizations after being notified by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police that possibly as many as seven people at the conference were hospitalized. According to the police report, detectives were unable to confirm whether additional attendees got sick.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0"&gt;Investigators are examining whether the illnesses were caused by an infection, contamination related to the injections or an issue with the medication itself, according to documents obtained by ProPublica. The two women who were taken by ambulance to the hospital reported feeling as if their tongues were swelling and had trouble breathing and increased heart rates. By the time they reached the hospital, one was already intubated and the other had lost muscle control in her neck and couldn’t open her eyes or communicate with doctors, according to the police report.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0"&gt;Holtorf said he was “so freaked out” by what happened because none of the women’s symptoms “made any sense.” In 30 years of providing such treatments, he said he’s never seen such a reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0"&gt;Event organizer James Strole, an Arizona businessman who has built a 50-year career selling the promise of eternal life to followers, said the two patients are recovering after several days in the hospital. He said “it’s not clear the people got sick as a result of treatment from Dr. Holtorf,” adding he’s “anxious” for the illnesses to be “deeply investigated.” He said nothing similar has happened in the 10 years he has been producing RAADFest.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0"&gt;This is the first year Holtorf offered therapies at the conference, Strole said. He added that Holtorf provided the therapies to 60 people at the event and has attempted to reach them to learn whether they experienced any problems. Holtorf said only six patients received peptides.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0"&gt;Strole said the coalition’s science board scrutinizes therapy providers before granting them permission to operate a booth in the conference’s exhibition hall, which organizers referred to as a clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0"&gt;“The big concern is safety,” he said. “We look at who is doing the administering, whether it’s an injection or supplement. We look at the person and the company itself, what the efficacy is, how they operate, their safety measures. We look at all that.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0"&gt;Strole said peptides are considered “generally safe” when taken under the direction of a doctor, adding that he takes them regularly. Holtorf also said he believes they are safe and that they saved his life when he was a young man suffering from a severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0"&gt;A review by ProPublica of both the pharmacy and medical board license databases showed no Nevada licenses for Holtorf or his medical practice. Out-of-state doctors who come to provide care at a conference such as RAADfest are required to obtain a special event license from the Nevada Board of Medical Examiners. (As of Friday, 103 doctors had obtained such a license.) To dispense or possess pharmaceuticals, practitioners must also be licensed by the Nevada Board of Pharmacy. RAADFest’s organizers, however, said they were unaware that Holtorf is not licensed to provide medical care or dispense medications in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0"&gt;“In order to practice medicine in the state, you must be licensed,” said David Wuest, executive secretary of the Nevada Board of Pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0"&gt;The Nevada Legislature has passed stricter laws as alternative therapies have become popular outside traditional medical settings. In 2017, for example, the state banned so-called Botox parties, requiring the anti-wrinkle injections only be administered in a medical office or spa equipped to deal with life-threatening emergencies. But beyond its standard medical licensing requirements, the state doesn’t have rules governing an event like RAADFest, where attendees receive an array of anti-aging therapies including gene therapies, peptide injections, dialysis-like blood detoxification, bone scans and light therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0"&gt;Strole said he wasn’t aware that providers need a special in-state license to provide the type of therapies Holtorf offered, which he described as “neutraceuticals.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.1"&gt;“I’ve never heard they had to get from the state permission to do that under the auspices of giving a treatment of that nature, that’s not actually treating some disease or something,” Strole said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0"&gt;According to the police report, Holtorf contracted with a Nevada-licensed nurse practitioner, who administered the injection to one of the women. He also contracted with another doctor, who mixed the vials and administered the injection to the second woman, the report said. That doctor does not appear to have the necessary Nevada licenses.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0"&gt;Holtorf declined to comment on the practitioners he hired for the event, other than to say he had worked with the doctor in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0"&gt;Wuest said multiple providers might be investigated, but he wouldn’t confirm whether Holtorf is a subject of the probe. The board also is investigating whether the therapy provided to the patients required a medical or pharmaceutical license. The FDA is assisting in the investigation to determine what was in the injections, including whether it was a manufactured pharmaceutical or a compounded medication, Wuest said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0"&gt;Holtorf’s medical practice and the peptide company he founded are affiliated with an organization, Forgotten Formula, that asserts a constitutional right to provide treatments as they see fit. On its website, the private membership association warns “all bodies in the public sector” that they “do not have any jurisdiction” over their doctors. “All doctors, healers, and members are protected under the shield of this organization,” the website says. “We operate member to member. Ignoring this disclaimer can lead to legal consequences against the party at fault.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0"&gt;According to the police report, Holtorf told officers he obtained the peptides dispensed at the festival from Forgotten Formula. In the interview with ProPublica, however, he denied that, saying he’s not sure which of the many manufacturers he works with provided the peptides used at the booth.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0"&gt;The women received different peptide concoctions, according to the police report. Both included at least one component described by the FDA as posing significant risks when compounded. Holtorf said it is difficult to keep up with which peptides are banned and which are still acceptable for compounding.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.0"&gt;“There is so much gray area,” he said. “People know they just get patients better.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0"&gt;Despite the FDA warnings, peptides were popular among RAADFest attendees who were promised “beautiful life-saving therapies” at the event’s clinic. Event organizers touted that 70 longevity experts would be on hand during the four-day event at the Red Rock Casino Resort Spa but did not list the vendors providing treatments on the event website.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0"&gt;“We have a RAAD clinic, where people will be able to come in at discounted prices and try and do these therapies safely with doctors,” Strole told &lt;a href="https://www.ktnv.com/morningblend/influencer-press-7-8-25"&gt;a Las Vegas TV news program&lt;/a&gt; while promoting the event.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0"&gt;Strole is executive director of the Scottsdale, Arizona-based Coalition for Radical Life Extension, one of a cluster of for-profit and nonprofit entities devoted to helping people achieve immortality founded by Strole and two “immortalist” business partners. Of the three co-founders, only Strole, who is in his 70s, is still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="40.0"&gt;Charles Brown, the original founder, claimed to have had a spiritual experience in the 1950s that showed him the path to immortality and proclaimed he could share that path with others, according to &lt;a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/scottsdale/2014/11/16/people-unlimited-scottsdale-charles-paul-brown-immortality/19152253/"&gt;an Arizona Republic story&lt;/a&gt;. Brown died of Parkinson’s disease in 2014. His wife, Bernadeane “Bernie” Brown, who operated the for-profit People Unlimited with Strole, died of breast cancer in 2024. Her body is said to have been &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8DAyMuy1Qc/"&gt;cryogenically preserved&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0"&gt;The nonprofit organizes the annual anti-aging festival, which charges more than $400 for a ticket, while People Unlimited offers monthly memberships for as much as $255 a month, according to its website. Members get access to weekly meetings, where Strole delivers motivational sermons on immortality and age reversal, as well as talks by guest speakers on wellness, discounts on “longevity protocols” and access to a community of people who “want you to live as much as they want to live.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0"&gt;Gutman, the Florida emergency room doctor, spoke at the event earlier this month, her first time attending RAADFest. She left before the last day, when the two women were hospitalized, and hadn’t heard about the incident before a reporter called. But she said their symptoms — swollen tongue, trouble breathing, increased heart rate — sounded like an allergic reaction, which she said isn’t terribly common in peptide injections. But she cautioned that before injection the drugs are mixed with an agent that can sometimes pose problems.&lt;/p&gt;

 Hoyas, often known as wax plants, have a reputation for thriving on “benign neglect”. They flower best when slightly stressed, as this triggers their reproductive mode. Regular watering and abundant nutrients will encourage leaf growth rather than blooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d3a38f79-5bf2-4ca2-b39a-fa21910e451b" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Houseplant clinic: how important is ‘plant hygiene’?","elementId":"d3a38f79-5bf2-4ca2-b39a-fa21910e451b","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/15/houseplant-clinic-how-important-is-plant-hygiene"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prescription&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Allow the soil to completely dry out between waterings – typically, every two to four weeks in autumn and winter, and more often in warmer months. Limit fertiliser applications, as hoyas flower better in nutrient-poor conditions. Ensure bright but indirect sunlight, as too much direct sunlight or a lack of darkness at night can disrupt their flowering cycle. Conversely, some people recommend “sun-stressing” their hoyas. Also, consider a slight drop in temperature overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Maintain a balance between attentive care and minimal interference. Aim for indirect lighting, cooler night-time temperatures, and less frequent feeding and watering. The mild stress should boost flowering potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Got a plant dilemma?

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts suspect the surge is due to doctors getting better at detecting the disorder and increased awareness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, health secretary &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/rfk-jr/index.html" id="mol-08e04160-6b22-11f0-bea6-f9606739b39b"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year announced a series of studies to hone in on 'environmental toxins' he believes are responsible, including pollution, ultra-processed foods and ultrasound scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lindsay Shea, one of the study authors and director of the Policy and Analytics Center at Drexel University's AJ Drexel Autism Institute, said during a conference presentation: ‘We see that autistic children have grown up to become mostly autistic adults and now older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The first generation of autistic adults are now in their 80s and 90s.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dementia is also on the rise, with experts suspecting it could strike 14million Americans by 2060.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one study presented this week at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference, researchers pulled Medicare and Medicaid claim data from 2017 to 2019 of nearly 800,000 Americans ages 30 and over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were split into four groups: autism, autism plus intellectual disability (fetal alcohol syndrome, for example) or intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were 60,087 people in the autism group, 101,748 with both autism and intellectual disability and 632,607 with only an intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were then compared to about 760,000 adults in the general population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found 30 percent of adults over 65 with autism were diagnosed with dementia compared to 19 percent in the general population, a 45 percent increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The difference was even greater for people with autism and intellectual disability, as 32 percent of this group developed dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among 50- to 64-year-olds, eight percent of people with autism had dementia compared to five percent of the general population, a 46 percent difference. And people with autism and another intellectual disability were three times more likely to have dementia than neurotypical people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also found 1.1 percent of autistic individuals between ages 30 and 49 had dementia compared to 0.8 percent in the general population, a 31 percent difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Shea said: 'This data supports the idea of both early onset and higher prevalence rates of dementia in these populations.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another study from George Washington University looked at two samples of 210 independent and 500 dependent autistic adults who reported signs of cognitive decline like trouble recalling tasks or words, impaired judgment or changes in behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caregivers also noted their dependent loved ones wandered at night, avoided initiating conversation and lost track of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Independent participants were between 42 and 81 years old with an average age of 54. Autistic adults dependent on a caregiver were 18 to 68 years old with an average age of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 30 percent of independent autistic people had two or more signs of cognitive decline while 10 percent of dependent adults had caregivers report at least one sign of impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common cognitive decline indicators were less interest in activities, everyday thinking problems and judgment issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Gregory Wallace, study author and associate professor at George Washington University, said: 'That's very high given the average age.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Wallace believes certain medications could be to blame. Nearly two-thirds of adults in the study were taking anticholinergics, drugs that block the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is crucial for muscle contractions, memory, learning and other functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows dementia risk divided by geographic region&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They're used to treat a variety of issues including urinary incontinence, gastrointestinal distress, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and Parkinson's disease, which are all more common in autistic people than the general population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These drugs are also sold over the counter in as Benadryl, Tylenol, Advil PM and Dramamine, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought that anticholinergics blocking the neurotransmitter acetylcholine over repeated use could lead to permanent damage to cognitive functions. Autistic people also tend to be more sensitive to medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The increased dementia risk also may be tied to chronic conditions like depression, diabetes and high blood pressure, which induce harmful inflammation in the brain and damage neurons responsible for memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Shea said: 'This is particularly noteworthy because all of these diagnoses are more prevalent in autism than they are in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We know that autistic adults are often unemployed, often don't have community integration and have high rates of obesity.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 04:52:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOQk9kLXJMbGxrcVAydlJMOUZzSW5zZG9KS3BEVFpOajBmQndTSDdrMERLcUpnSS1MZWVyRUdPUUJjS0JTRHBvYS10TjdCeG5TZWdTSWQ1ejVIcmw3U0d0YVRvckNOdHE3N0VGYXRQeUszVkdMb1R2TjhwNFQxMGxkNWVFRmtRSktUWFBVY3daZXhmb1dnd3NyU05CMXEyN0dQa01B0gGoAUFVX3lxTE0xeWYzOW05d2Y2dGw4dnRZUkdyV3BRRkZLeHFhbG1oWU9ENWFvYUt5WTlpZVdLQnptS0R6dzVvSzNwYm5ndkFXMG1uVW1xc0hvdml2ZDN4eHVPZkxFWjA3LW1PVWZXdS1jVlRZNlFZYlNFNlFOcjFXcThIdnUzaVJteHVfYUFkekFHRzJHWHlSX29LZUJNb2tsZ3F5djlDYl9CTkhIRElfUw</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，五分之三的肝癌病例是可以预防的-西雅图时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNeGlIVm9aNFB5d3NMeU9vTHQ1cGdqbk5wOE5aS3RLUEZkSzVqbWdObHpMT09na01tc2NDYzdtYVJPQ3o2MnI4eXdaZzJOUlBuRFNjYXd0UXYySjZVMzktVkhMV3FDMGdqVEl2VlJEdmxJSFhmdWdCQXN6a3ZyZ1M4bE0zY3FsOHdrWTc1Z3VRZ1o1Skx4RWROV3RfUENtU0FGM0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNeGlIVm9aNFB5d3NMeU9vTHQ1cGdqbk5wOE5aS3RLUEZkSzVqbWdObHpMT09na01tc2NDYzdtYVJPQ3o2MnI4eXdaZzJOUlBuRFNjYXd0UXYySjZVMzktVkhMV3FDMGdqVEl2VlJEdmxJSFhmdWdCQXN6a3ZyZ1M4bE0zY3FsOHdrWTc1Z3VRZ1o1Skx4RWROV3RfUENtU0FGM0E?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;3 out of 5 liver cancer cases are preventable, study finds&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/stories/CAAqNggKIjBDQklTSGpvSmMzUnZjbmt0TXpZd1NoRUtEd2pSX2FUa0RoSGc2bDFsMms1eUFpZ0FQAQ?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US:en&amp;amp;oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;View Full Coverage on Google News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 04:27:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxNeGlIVm9aNFB5d3NMeU9vTHQ1cGdqbk5wOE5aS3RLUEZkSzVqbWdObHpMT09na01tc2NDYzdtYVJPQ3o2MnI4eXdaZzJOUlBuRFNjYXd0UXYySjZVMzktVkhMV3FDMGdqVEl2VlJEdmxJSFhmdWdCQXN6a3ZyZ1M4bE0zY3FsOHdrWTc1Z3VRZ1o1Skx4RWROV3RfUENtU0FGM0E</guid></item><item><title>研究揭示了缓解老年慢性病的关键途径- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPOVl4SGR0bkRmcXItMkVVVGtnSF9LTkFNb09YNlM1d1BpeWh0V0Qtc0h6dXROLUx2TlMydENxQWxBSGt6S2J1VFZuNDVWRnhISVAtMG1uVnhucHgyNXZRMnJDN2VFZlA3a3Rfa1ZkMHZJSldMbFV4ekdRSV9Kc0tHMTB0NDFvMXdZZ21RNWJR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

What made the difference?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to our new research, diet may be a key part of the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00929-8"&gt;In our new study&lt;/a&gt;, our group at the Aging Research Center at the Karolinska Institutet, Sweden, followed more than 2,400 older Swedish adults for 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that people who consistently ate a healthy diet developed chronic diseases more slowly, in contrast to those whose diets were considered more inflammatory; that is, diets high in processed meats, refined grains and sugary drinks, which are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/clear-evidence-for-a-link-between-pro-inflammatory-diets-and-27-chronic-diseases-heres-how-you-can-eat-better-158451"&gt;known to promote low-grade chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-30-year-study-may-have-found-the-single-best-diet-for-healthy-aging?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;A 30-Year Study May Have Found The Single Best Diet For Healthy Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is important because having several health conditions at the same time is one of the biggest problems older people face. It increases the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/circresaha.118.312816"&gt;risk of disability, hospitalisation and early death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also places a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afaf006"&gt;huge burden on healthcare systems&lt;/a&gt;. But while it has been long known that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2014.12.009"&gt;diet can help prevent individual diseases&lt;/a&gt;, our study shows that it may also influence the overall pace of biological ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We looked at four well-known dietary patterns. Three of them – &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2015.04.011"&gt;the Mind diet&lt;/a&gt; (designed to protect brain health), &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.111.157222"&gt;the Alternative Healthy Eating Index&lt;/a&gt; (based on foods linked to lower disease risk) and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/82.1.163"&gt;the Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; – were associated with slower disease accumulation. The fourth, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxw105"&gt;a diet high in inflammatory foods&lt;/a&gt;, was linked to faster accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169330" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169330" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/med_diet_example_642.jpg" alt="salad" class="wp-image-169330 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/med_diet_example_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/med_diet_example_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169330" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mediterranean diet can help slow onset of chronic disease. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADGv-APMbg/"&gt;Dana Tentis/Pexels/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest associations were seen for cardiovascular and psychiatric conditions. So, people who ate better were less likely to develop diseases including heart failure, stroke, depression or dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did not, however, find a clear link between diet and musculoskeletal diseases such as arthritis or osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the benefits of healthy eating were more pronounced in women and in the oldest participants: those aged 78 and above. This suggests that it is never too late to make changes. Even in very old age, diet matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does food have such a strong potential? One reason may be inflammation. As people age, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41569-018-0064-2"&gt;many develop low-grade chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; – sometimes called "inflammaging" – which is linked to a wide range of diseases. Diets high in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/dmso.s427412"&gt;vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and healthy fats&lt;/a&gt; tend to reduce inflammation. Diets rich in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/jn.115.228718"&gt;highly processed foods and sugar do the opposite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason is that healthy diets support the body's resilience. They provide essential nutrients that help maintain &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2023.1207237"&gt;immune function&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnha.2023.100002"&gt;muscle mass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2015.04.011"&gt;cognitive health&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, this can make a big difference in how people age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study is one of the longest and most comprehensive of its kind. We used repeated dietary assessments and tracked more than 60 chronic health conditions. We also tested our findings using different analytical methods to make sure they held up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, diet is just one piece of the puzzle. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanhl.2024.100681"&gt;Physical activity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/joim.12739"&gt;social connections&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41514-024-00148-2"&gt;access to healthcare&lt;/a&gt; all play important roles in healthy ageing. But improving diet quality is a relatively simple and accessible way to help older adults live longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169331" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169331" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/physical_activity_chronic_disease_642.jpg" alt="man at the gym" class="wp-image-169331 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/physical_activity_chronic_disease_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/physical_activity_chronic_disease_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169331" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Diet is just part of the equation for keeping chronic illness at bay. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEvwIL0qYM/"&gt;nomadsoulphotos/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what should older adults eat? The message is clear: eat plenty of vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts and whole grains. Choose healthy fats like rapeseed oil and fish. Limit red and processed meats, sugary drinks and solid fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the building blocks of the diets we studied – and they have been associated with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03570-5"&gt;slower ageing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.27125"&gt;better brain health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00929-8"&gt;fewer chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt; in this and other research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ageing is inevitable. But people can shape how it unfolds. Our findings suggest that even small changes in diet can make a meaningful difference in how people experience later life, regardless of their age.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261233/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Until we start noticing something out of the ordinary about it. Then it becomes hard to remain calm, and we begin to seek information or reassurance from others that the strange things we’re experiencing have a perfectly normal explanation. &lt;span&gt;The people in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1m7v1ej/what_weird_thing_does_your_body_do_you_that_you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; thread did exactly that.

When its quiet and I'm trying to sleep I'll hear what sounds like a radio playing quietly in another room.

It freaks me out sometimes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;moon_buzz:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can't express how happy I was to read this, thought I was insane. Alone at night I can totally hear rhythmic music in the silence, if i lift my head to get a better listen then it goes away. head back on pillow it goes again.

It’s simply how our bodies function, which means that we don’t have much control over it. &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/medical-pics-medicalpedia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;Medical&lt;/a&gt; experts online have been discussing and helping people understand more about them, so they know that experiencing strange symptoms is very common and that, for the most part, they’re nothing to worry about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something that many are concerned about is hair loss. However, shedding is an ordinary part of having hair on our heads. “Most of us lose up to 100 hairs from our scalp every day, which is normal,” &lt;a href="https://www.thehealthy.com/skin-health/bizarre-bodily-functions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; family physician Jennifer Caudle. “About 80 million men and women in the United States have hereditary hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But, it’s possible to lose hair if you have certain medical conditions or take certain medicines,” she noted. Excessive hair loss can also be caused by stress or malnutrition, weight changes, hormonal imbalances, menopause, thyroid issues, or iron deficiency. So if you start noticing extreme hair loss, you might want to see your doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9079361"&gt;  &lt;p id="9079361" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/curated-lifestyle-kmPNhnXm_Bs-unsplash-688726dec9bfb__700.jpg" alt="Close-up of ear with jewelry and hand near face illustrating weird things bodies do that people don’t understand." title="Close-up of ear with jewelry and hand near face illustrating weird things bodies do that people don’t understand."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I can voluntarily flex my tympanic membranes which is rarer than I originally thought.

It’s called a ‘hypnic jerk’ or ‘sleep start,’ which can be accompanied by the feeling of falling. Up to 70% of people sometimes have this symptom. Even though scientists can’t really explain why they happen, they reassure us that they’re nothing to worry about, as they’re likely caused by our body releasing tension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We often hold tension in our muscles from stress during the day,” sleep expert Dr. Richard Shane says. “When we begin to relax on the way to &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/funny-sleep-memes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes that tension releases as a jerk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9079354"&gt;  &lt;p id="9079354" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/getty-images-MGjvHl73PtY-unsplash-688724e0821ea__700.jpg" alt="Woman drinking water outdoors, illustrating weird things their bodies do that they don’t understand." title="Woman drinking water outdoors, illustrating weird things their bodies do that they don’t understand."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;My throat gets stuck when I swallow water sometimes.

In animals this may actually form a layer of insulation,” Dr. Caudle says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They can occur due to cold air or also happen when we experience strong emotions such as shock, fear, anxiety, or even being inspired.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9079356"&gt;  &lt;p id="9079356" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-68872d68e0a8d__700.jpg" alt="Young woman cleaning ear with cotton swab, illustrating weird things bodies do that people don’t understand." title="Young woman cleaning ear with cotton swab, illustrating weird things bodies do that people don’t understand."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I produce a truly astonishing amount of ear wax.

Because the moment you try not to think about it, they can start appearing more frequently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9079400"&gt;  &lt;p id="9079400" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/getty-images-DqEKgek2Y0I-unsplash-68872ecd3c4d5__700.jpg" alt="Young woman with eyes closed holding neck, illustrating weird things their bodies do that they don’t understand concept." title="Young woman with eyes closed holding neck, illustrating weird things their bodies do that they don’t understand concept."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I have a milk duct thingy above my collarbone.

Basically when I see something that triggers it (side note hate that people b*********d that word and when people misuse it) my brain desides that it doesnt need blood anymore, and will cause me to get extremely dizzy, hyper ventilate, become light headed, and then ultimately pass out. This sequence will all happen within 2 minutes. During that time my brain decides it also needs to confirm that it doesnt like said scene by playing it on repeat until I pass out. And for bonus fun, sound and description can also trigger this response.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ive caused buildings to be rewired, policies to be changed, and have scared the living s**t out of people seeing this response.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As for what triggers it, surgery scenes, needles in arms irl, detailed injuries. What doesnt trigger it? Stupidly over the top bloody scenes like in anime. However a friend decided to show this scene where a dude cuts a girls palm with his finger and let her slower bleed out from it, and yup that triggered it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh and for even more bonus points my brain recently decided to remind me about this fun glitch by causing one of my f*****g dreams to trigger an episode in the middle of the god d**n night.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1m7v1ej/what_weird_thing_does_your_body_do_you_that_you/n4vqyoh/" target="_blank"&gt; volanger &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-9854-100/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9079367"&gt;  &lt;p id="9079367" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;My gut changes what it likes and doesn't like on a whim.

                                        &lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking study has revealed that babies as young as four months old are capable of forming memories, despite being unable to recall them later in life. Researchers used brain scans to capture memory formation in 26 infants, ranging from 4 to 24 months old. The study found that the hippocampus, a region of the brain associated with emotions and memory, is active in babies when they form memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt7570"&gt;researchers showed&lt;/a&gt; the babies a series of images and then tested their memory recall by displaying familiar and new images side by side. The study found that older infants (12-24 months) exhibited activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, a region involved in memory-related decision-making and recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We showed infants photographs of faces, objects, and scenes one at a time during fMRI. Shortly afterward, we tested their memory by showing each of these now-familiar photographs alongside a new image of the same type. If the infant looked longer at the photograph they had seen before, we labelled that image as remembered; otherwise, it was forgotten," &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/you-dont-remember-being-a-baby-but-your-brain-was-making-memories/"&gt;said the lead author &lt;/a&gt;of the study Dr Nick Turk-Browne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that infants can create memories after brief experiences, with clearer effects after 12 months. The findings support the idea that people store memories as infants that they can't access later. However, questions remain about the duration and complexity of these memories. The research also raises deeper questions about why people can't recall memories from before age 4-5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding infant memory can provide insights into language acquisition, developmental disorders, and early education. It may also shed light on memory loss in ageing and diseases like Alzheimer's. Further research is needed to uncover the mechanisms behind infant memory and its implications for human development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="v-ndtv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We know that exercise has numerous &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/less-than-30-minutes-of-exercise-does-something-wonderful-for-your-brain"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, but does it matter how much you spread it out? Even only working out on the weekends may still reduce some people's risk of early death, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers were interested in how people might build physical activity into busy schedules and decided to focus on those &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/soups-and-shakes-diet-can-put-type-2-diabetes-into-remission-study-finds"&gt;with diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, for whom exercise-related benefits such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/daily-dose-of-broccoli-sprout-extract-helps-blood-sugar-study-shows"&gt;reduced insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; are particularly important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many people struggle to engage in regular physical activity throughout the week due to time constraints," the team from the US, China, and Australia &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00640"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To overcome this, some condense their recommended moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) into 1 or 2 weekly sessions – a pattern known as the 'weekend warrior' approach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ideal-number-of-daily-steps-isnt-as-many-as-weve-been-told?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Ideal Number of Daily Steps Isn't as Many as We've Been Told&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers crunched the numbers on 51,650 adults with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="168880" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, splitting them into four groups: those who did no MVPA, those who did less than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/behealthy/physical-activity"&gt;the recommended 150 minutes&lt;/a&gt; per week, those who hit 150 minutes a week in 3 or more sessions, and those who managed 150 minutes a week in 1–2 sessions (the weekend warriors).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any level of exercise was shown to be beneficial, but primarily for those who managed the MVPA recommendations. People who participated in 3 or more weekly sessions had a 17 percent lower risk of dying during the study period, as well as a 19 percent lower risk of dying from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cardiac-arrest-and-heart-attacks-arent-the-same-heres-how-to-tell-them-apart"&gt;cardiovascular-related issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weekend warriors fared even better: this group showed a 21 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality and a 33 percent lower risk of cardiovascular-related mortality. So even if you only have time &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/less-than-30-minutes-of-exercise-does-something-wonderful-for-your-brain"&gt;for a single exercise session&lt;/a&gt; or a couple of workouts, you can still get some of the same health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168890" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168890" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ExerciseCharts.jpg" alt="Exercise charts" class="wp-image-168890 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ExerciseCharts.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ExerciseCharts-600x385.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168890" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers charted exercise against mortality. (Wu et al., &lt;em&gt;Ann. Intern. Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even those who engaged in MPVA for less than 150 minutes per week experienced lower all-cause mortality than those who didn't," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00640"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This underscores the importance of any physical activity for people with diabetes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study doesn't establish cause and effect and by its use of self-reported data to look at a snapshot in time – and in only covering people with diabetes. However, it's backed by many previous studies that show &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-5-minute-workout-each-day-can-still-make-a-huge-health-difference"&gt;any amount of exercise&lt;/a&gt; can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most past research has agreed that the weekend warrior approach works as well as any other: as long as you're hitting those recommended targets, you get the same benefits in terms of both &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-finds-getting-all-your-exercise-on-the-weekend-is-probably-fine"&gt;physical health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/giant-study-reveals-what-happens-if-you-dont-exercise-until-the-weekend"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's encouraging for anyone struggling to fit in gym visits during the Monday-Friday grind, but &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/leaving-all-your-exercise-til-the-weekend-could-be-just-as-good-as-regular-workouts"&gt;most studies&lt;/a&gt; (including this latest one) define weekend warriors as those who only exercise properly 1–2 times a week, regardless of the days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Previous studies in the general population suggest weekend warriors may obtain comparable mortality benefits to regularly active persons, though estimates vary by population characteristics (for example, non-leisure-time physical activity)," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00640"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-25-00640"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you hit your 50s, Landsverk says, even moderate drinking can wreak havoc on the body. “Alcohol, besides the vascular damage and dementia risks, increases the risk of breast cancer, esophageal cancer and liver cancer (after disease),” she said. Because cancer risk drastically increases as we age, adding any amount of alcohol into the mix will only further increase that risk. “Plus, as we age, good sleep is more elusive,” Landsverk added. “Substances like caffeine, cigarettes and alcohol all hinder sleep”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In your 60s, you’ll likely begin to feel the effects of moderate drinking on your body. “I can speak from experience: This is the age when tolerance may decrease dramatically,” Landsverk said. “I am healthy. I can ski or swim a mile, but a glass of wine makes me feel ill and slow the next day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, she says, is because older people are more likely to lose the enzyme to metabolize alcohol (alcohol dehydrogenase). “At this point, I can tolerate about one glass a week,” Landsverk noted. “If I had it daily, I would feel sick with just one glass a day. Older people have less reserve in the brain, liver and kidneys. The damage to the brain from even one glass a day is worse [when you’re over 60].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landsverk suggests that you think of alcoholic beverages like candy bars. “They’re nice with some meals, but they can increase your weight and blood sugar, and over decades adds to cancer risk and chronic illnesses that can lead to poor health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to stay as healthy as possible and feel your best as you age, do you have to give up alcohol completely? No, Landsverk emphasizes, and it’s important to remember to remember that other factors influence the impact alcohol has on your health and well-being, such as if you’re living with a disease like obesity or hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re older and in generally good health, you shouldn’t worry too much about the occasional alcoholic beverage. That’s certainly the case for Landsverk. “I  have decided that a glass of wine with a nice meal is worth it,” she said. “But not every night.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-moderate-alcohol-intake-impacts-your-health-as-you-age_l_65942a00e4b0f27b6e355dbb" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7914851"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anti-inflammatory proteins like fish, legumes and soy support healthy metabolism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lean meats and fermented soy boost gut health, regulate blood sugar and aid in sustainable weight loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Balanced meals, sleep, exercise and stress control are key for long-term weight health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-protein-and-its-benefits-11732679" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Protein&lt;/a&gt; plays a key role in reducing inflammation and supporting metabolic health—two factors that can make weight loss more achievable and sustainable. While no single food guarantees weight loss, some high-protein options offer added benefits that support overall well-being. "Choosing anti-inflammatory proteins helps to lower chronic inflammation that drives insulin resistance," says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaitlin-hippley/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Kaitlin Hippley, M.Ed., RDN, LD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. "When insulin resistance is high, blood sugars rise, fat storage is activated and losing weight can become more challenging."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "There’s really no such thing as a 'weight loss protein,'" adds &lt;a href="https://revvhealth.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Marissa Beck, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. "The real health benefit comes from choosing a variety of protein sources that support overall health by lowering inflammation, improving cholesterol and stabilizing blood sugar."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Read on for a closer look at the anti-inflammatory protein foods that dietitians recommend most, and why they’re worth adding to your plate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-fatty-fish"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Fatty Fish &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fatty fish are top-tier when it comes to anti-inflammatory protein sources. Rich in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-lower-inflammation-8783795" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; like EPA and DHA, these fish support heart and brain health—plus, they help reduce inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Salmon is my number one favorite and highest recommended protein source when following an anti-inflammatory diet because of its high levels of omega-3 fats and micronutrients," says Lindsay Fencl, RDN. These healthy fats can also lower blood pressure, reduce triglycerides and support healthy cholesterol levels—things that are often disrupted in people with insulin resistance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beck says that the omega-3s found in fatty fish "have well-documented anti-inflammatory benefits" and are a valuable part of a balanced, healthy diet. Including fish like salmon, mackerel or sardines in a few meals a week aligns with the Mediterranean diet recommendations, which have been shown to reduce the risk of chronic disease and improve metabolic health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-legumes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Legumes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-anti-inflammatory-plant-based-protein-11772251" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Legumes&lt;/a&gt;—such as beans and lentils—are rich in fiber, plant-based protein and antioxidants that support gut health and reduce inflammation. "Thanks to fiber and polyphenols, beans and lentils earn their title of powerhouse plant proteins," says Hippley. "They naturally lower inflammation and support sustainable weight loss by improving gut health and fighting oxidative stress."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Emerging research also suggests that legumes may help the body produce more of its own appetite-regulating hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which helps regulate blood sugar levels and increases feelings of fullness and satisfaction. This is thanks to its protein and calcium content, which may have a synergistic effect that promotes increased GLP-1 production after eating.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lean meats—like chicken, turkey, venison and bison—are protein-rich and lower in saturated fat, making them an ideal option for those seeking to reduce inflammation and lose weight. "These lean animal-based proteins all offer different micronutrients that play a role in managing inflammation," says Beck. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Wild game meat, such as venison, elk and bison, tends to be leaner, richer in iron and raised without additives common in conventionally farmed meats," says Fencl. These meats offer several anti-inflammatory nutrients, including zinc and selenium, which support immune regulation and help neutralize oxidative stress.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fermented soy-based proteins, including tofu and tempeh, are rich in complete protein and isoflavones—compounds with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. "These plant proteins come packaged with fiber and phytochemicals that support gut and heart health," Beck tells &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;. These benefits are particularly valuable for reducing markers of inflammation and supporting insulin sensitivity, which can make weight regulation more manageable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fermented soy products like tempeh may also support gut health by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and reducing digestive inflammation, especially when paired with a fiber-rich diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Recent research suggests that the health of the gut microbiome may have a significant impact on metabolism and body weight.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While eating protein can support metabolism, reduce inflammation and promote weight loss, it’s only one piece of the puzzle. "What often gets missed in typical weight loss advice is that it’s not just one food or one nutrient that determines our health status," Beck explains. "Eating habits and other behaviors matter just as much, if not more." Here are some things you can do to support healthy weight loss:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat regularly throughout the day.&lt;/strong&gt; "Eating regular meals and snacks can help regulate blood sugar and prevent an evening binge or emotional eating cycle that many people struggle with," says Beck. Eating consistently also supports stable energy levels and helps reduce cravings. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include a variety of whole, nutrient-dense foods.&lt;/strong&gt; "Research consistently shows that dietary diversity promotes a healthy gut microbiome, supports disease prevention and enhances weight management," says Fencl.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and healthy fats as part of your routine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize sleep.&lt;/strong&gt; "Sleep deprivation has been shown to increase inflammatory molecules like cytokines and C-reactive protein," says Fencl.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Aim for 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move your body regularly.&lt;/strong&gt; Regular physical activity can improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation and improve mood. Even low-impact movement—like walking and stretching—can help regulate appetite and support sustainable weight loss. Try to engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress.&lt;/strong&gt; "Managing stress can lower inflammation, control cravings and stabilize blood sugars, making weight loss more achievable," says Hippley. Try deep breathing, meditation or yoga.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no such thing as a magic protein for weight loss, but incorporating a variety of nutrient-dense protein sources into your eating pattern can reduce inflammation and support weight loss. When paired with other healthy habits—like eating a balanced diet, regular exercise, adequate sleep and stress management—you can support long-term health and sustainable results. &lt;br&gt;

When the swelling didn’t go down, she eventually went to a foot doctor, who thought the problem might be vascular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;About that time, her parents needed help clear across the country, so she put it on the back burner, but as she drove out to help her parents, her entire right leg swelled up into her groin and lower abdomen. Clearly not a foot problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Her family doctor suspected lymphedema, a diagnosis an ultrasound later confirmed. She had a malady few people know about, including many doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It’s not that it’s uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="2041" data-height="3000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/UWKV54ISJVGJ7MU3NFYY2XUKAE.jpg?auth=e34f8642dbaa5735203d0043b9685a430cc09ed0867a1a6251048d039b65256a&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=1175" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/UWKV54ISJVGJ7MU3NFYY2XUKAE.jpg?auth=e34f8642dbaa5735203d0043b9685a430cc09ed0867a1a6251048d039b65256a&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=2350 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Ashley Hodge’s foot is still swollen with lymphedema after months of treatment including compression dressings, manual lymphatic massages and sequential pneumatic compression. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Ashley Hodge &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://lymphaticnetwork.org/documents/LERN_Resource_Guide_Download.pdf" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Lymphatic Education &amp;amp; Research Network&lt;/a&gt; (LE&amp;amp;RN) reports up to 10 million people in the U.S. alone suffer from lymphedema and lymphatic diseases and that’s likely an undercount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That’s more than from multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson’s and AIDS combined. Seven million of those cases are related to cancer and its treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Col. Susan Fondy, an Army flight surgeon whose 20-year career culminated with a three-year assignment as the chief surgeon of the Army National Guard before she retired to Frederick, Maryland, said when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, she took a LE&amp;amp;RN eight-hour course designed for medical professionals “and learned a ton.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She was told the “weird tightness” in her armpit within a couple of weeks of cancer surgery was normal. When it turned into full-blown lymphedema, she realized how little the medical community knows about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="2400" data-height="3000"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/IW3CRWFBKBDATPPLYCO2PILU7M.jpg?auth=8983199b8d52c376d14b4062718929fe04913e45234b2fdb7496a6510a1720ae&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=1000" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/IW3CRWFBKBDATPPLYCO2PILU7M.jpg?auth=8983199b8d52c376d14b4062718929fe04913e45234b2fdb7496a6510a1720ae&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=2000 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Retired Col. Susan Fondy, a flight surgeon who did four tours in the military, developed lymphedema after cancer. While lymphedema is not deadly, it can be miserable and she said her medical school training spent 15 minutes on the topic. She was stunned to learn how little most doctors know about the condition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| U.S. Army Official Photo &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She said when she was in medical school, lymphedema was about a 15-minute discussion, despite how often it afflicts people. Including her. Her own cancer was found at the end of her fourth deployment — “ one of those welcome home, you have cancer kind of things.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="A-cancer-'souvenir'" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;A cancer ‘souvenir’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Tissue swells when protein-rich fluid that’s supposed to drain through the lymphatic system instead accumulates, sometimes in shocking amounts. Google the condition and there are photos of legs as big as normal torsos or ankles grown to the size of cantaloupes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Risk depends in part on the type of cancer. Seventy percent of head or neck cancer survivors will develop lymphedema that can entirely alter their appearance. Lymphedema will impact 30% of breast cancer patients, 30% of sarcoma patients, 20% of those with gynecological cancer, 16% with melanoma and 10% with genital urinary cancer. All forms of cancer treatment, including for prostate cancer, can lead to lymphedema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;There’s also a rare inherited form, different from the acquired, “secondary” lymphedema that can happen to anyone at any age, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537239/#:~:text=Epidemiology,%2C%20external%2C%20or%20combined%20lymphedema." target="_blank" rel=""&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. Swelling can occur in arms, hands, legs, feet, breast, chest, shoulder, pelvis, groin, genitals and face/mouth tissues. It can steal range of motion and discolor skin or cause pain, and alter sensation and limb heaviness. Sometimes clothes no longer fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Actress Kathy Bates survived both ovarian and breast cancer and became a spokesperson for LE&amp;amp;RN. She calls the condition a “souvenir of cancer” that is “chronic, debilitating and currently permanent swelling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lymphaticnetwork.org/news-events/video-library/cdc-kathy-bates-and-lymphedema" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://lymphaticnetwork.org/news-events/video-library/cdc-kathy-bates-and-lymphedema"&gt;In a video&lt;/a&gt;, she tells people with cancer to ask their medical team how it plans to reduce the risk of lymphedema during cancer treatment. She also tells them to learn the early signs, which include tingling and slight heaviness. Lymphedema is not deadly, though it can lead to infections that can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It is instead frustrating, disruptive, uncomfortable and incurable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Hitting-brakes-on-research" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Hitting brakes on research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Lymphedema is a stark example of what happens when medical research is deprioritized, advocates say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;William Repicci, president and CEO of LE&amp;amp;RN, sighs heavily as he discusses the roller coaster that has been research funding for lymphedema and other lymphatic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Getting funding for research has been like clinging to a coaster’s rails with your fingers and toes and inching forward manually, then jumping into the car at the top, only to plunge to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Last month, researchers at the biannual Lymphatic Forum that LE&amp;amp;RN hosts said their grants had been canceled. Others said all research funding to their universities had been held up since March or April; whether it will be released is unknown. If money’s not released by August, research programs will start to close, Repicci said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Studying lymphedema provides insight into other diseases with lymphatic system ties, including diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Repicci said. “So when we pull back from research, it’s not just a matter of ignoring the needs of those people who have incurable lymphedema or the tens of thousands of children born with lymphatic malformations. It goes much further than that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;For lymphedema research funding, the hits just kept on coming. LE&amp;amp;RN had lobbied hard to be part of the CDC’s Chronic Disease Education and Awareness program, which gets a lot of the public health giant’s attention. Their three-year grant resulted in more than 500 people a day visiting their virtual resource center to learn how to talk to their family and doctors about the disease. In October 2024, LE&amp;amp;RN was approved for a three-year extension if funds became available. To date, no money has been forthcoming and the group struggles to find outside funding to keep the program operating. The president’s budget for the coming year has zeroed out the program entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Advocates also managed to get lymphedema research included on the list that Congress puts together for the Department of Defense peer review medical research program by showing that lymphedema disproportionately impacts people in the military, “especially by pointing out that, thanks to the burn pits in Afghanistan and Iraq, where service members were inhaling toxic fumes, they were coming down with a whole host of diseases. At the top of the list was head and neck cancer, which results in lymphedema in over 70% of patients,” Repicci said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;For two years, the research was funded, resulting in $12 million in lymphatic and lymphedema research grants. The program funding was then cut by more than half, while dozens of new diseases cut from other programs were added to the list eligible for funding. The result was twice as many diseases and half the funding, Repicci said. Neither lymphedema nor lymphatic diseases made the list for the fiscal 2025 budget, so researchers can’t even apply for the funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“This year when lymphatic diseases mysteriously dropped from the list it was really shocking,” Fondy said, adding it wouldn’t cost any extra to add it back on. “It’s just a matter of letting our researchers compete with other researchers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2174"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/FTNL754M4FH4PJLMGDSUJCC5NQ.JPG?auth=95d779daf8f67333aaac0e07df17484ac64b6db14bcadc5912ab5803f3264ad6&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=579" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/FTNL754M4FH4PJLMGDSUJCC5NQ.JPG?auth=95d779daf8f67333aaac0e07df17484ac64b6db14bcadc5912ab5803f3264ad6&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1158 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Kirsten Fox poses for photos at her home near Park City on Saturday, July 12, 2025. She is among millions of Americans with lymphedema, a condition causing painful swelling. She developed lymphedema as a side effect of surgery following breast cancer, though it can also result from other causes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Scott G Winterton, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Other research funding has also been cut or is now very shaky, Repicci said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Congress had asked the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to create the National Commission on Lymphatic Diseases to study improving the prognosis for lymphatic diseases and to learn more about them. Work began last year, but there have been no official meetings this year. Repicci thinks the panel is determined to release its report, even with no further meetings, but “I fear no matter what it says, my ability to lobby to fund any of the kinds of changes that are in there has greatly diminished,” he said, despite bipartisan support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“The sense at this point from both sides is that an example is going to be made of Health and Human Services, and there’s nothing we can do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Almost-anyone's-disease" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Almost anyone’s disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;While breast cancer accounts for the most cancer cases, lymphedema’s not a women’s disease. The &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/prostate-cancer/about/key-statistics.html#:~:text=About%20313%2C780%20new%20cases%20of,do%20not%20die%20from%20it." target="_blank" rel=""&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; reports roughly 1 in 8 men will at some point develop prostate cancer. After treatment, lymphedema can occur in the legs, groin or scrotum. Men and children also suffer from lymphedema either through cancer or because they are born with it or for hereditary reasons. Melanoma is one reason members of the military are hit so hard by lymphedema, because they spend so much of their time unprotected outside. Melanoma rates are much higher in the military than in the broader population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;People can get lymphedema as well from a bad car accident, surgical trauma, a groin hernia surgery, said Dr. Fatma Tuncer, a lymphedema specialist and plastic surgeon at Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah. The origin of some cases remains unknown. Long-term studies suggest it can take 10 years to manifest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Most of the time, the issue is quality of life,” she said. “People have jobs, careers, hobbies they can’t do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="1067" data-height="1600"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/CIPVEIAGTZGANF5TV5V5DVEKJQ.jpg?auth=1bd72a3d9702cbd6fe9c3f33a7f1456134921f9bc6b87198e10d62a5fa523a24&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=1199" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/CIPVEIAGTZGANF5TV5V5DVEKJQ.jpg?auth=1bd72a3d9702cbd6fe9c3f33a7f1456134921f9bc6b87198e10d62a5fa523a24&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=2398 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Ashley Hodges, holding baby, at her daughter’s wedding.

Patients with chronic lymphedema for a decade or more risk developing lymphangiosarcoma — a highly aggressive tumor that may require amputation of the involved extremity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Treating-lymphedema" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Treating lymphedema&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Managing lymphedema can take hours daily, including donning compression garments, being vigilant about skin care, doing self-lymph draining or using a pneumatic compression device, as well as special exercises to remove fluid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2971"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/QZQATABMYFHPNEPC2KJ4QU7BKE.jpg?auth=acbfa259e2c9fc4442e084d521afe5e5a96a04f668341f21084ff3a9d22fa229&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=792" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/QZQATABMYFHPNEPC2KJ4QU7BKE.jpg?auth=acbfa259e2c9fc4442e084d521afe5e5a96a04f668341f21084ff3a9d22fa229&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1584 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Jeffrey “Doc” Hodges does a light massage to help manually drain the lymphedema from Ashley Hodge’s leg. She uses a combination of compression, dressings, manual lymphatic massages and sequential pneumatic compression to try to control the accumulation of fluid. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Ashley Hodges &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Few know that better than Fondy, who wears compression garments all the time. Lymphedema, she said, is “one of those things that profoundly affects my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Huntsman Cancer Institute is designated as a Comprehensive Cancer Center of Excellence in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Lymphatic Diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“At Huntsman Cancer Institute, we offer a spectrum of surgeries, use state of the art imagery, and offer care from our certified lymphedema therapists to provide patients the best lymphedema treatment possible,” said Tuncer, who is also an assistant professor of surgery at the Spencer Fox Eccles School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She said most people first hear the word when it’s diagnosed. While some patients have mild cases, others may be hospitalized for infection and even end up in intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The main treatment is massaging where fluid builds up, and once the fluid goes down, compression garments to keep the fluid from building up again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;When surgery was first suggested as a possible solution, it was met with doubt. Fondy said there’s no medication to treat it. Surgery can provide relief, but surgeons are often overworked and booked seven months to a year out. A lot of the lymphedema therapists don’t even recommend surgery because there are so few plastic surgeons trained to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Patients should not expect a cure from surgery, “which is not perfect,” Tuncer added. But it can help a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Some of Tuncer’s older patients have arthritis and can’t put their garments on. She would also love to see lighter garments developed. And garments don’t help everyone. Head and neck cancer treatments are especially problematic because there is no way to use compression safely. Those patients have few options to manage it, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Tuncer emphasized the need to avoid infection. That’s something Kirsten Fox, 62, knows about firsthand. In 2014, after being diagnosed with breast cancer, the Park City, Utah, woman had a double mastectomy. Because of the family history, the cancer, which was in both breasts, was detected fairly early, but during surgery cancer was found in multiple lymph nodes and 10 were removed on one side, the rest radiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She had a little lymphedema after surgery. Hers isn’t out of control like some get, but it impacted her job and thus her livelihood. Her arm was wrapped in something akin to a cast. She started seeing a lymphedema therapist for full lymph drainage. That included relatively light massages every six to eight weeks. Then she bumped her arm in July 2023. The skin didn’t break, but she developed great pain, got flushed and felt loopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In the emergency room, doctors said she had cellulitis, a serious infection that’s common with lymphedema. “I’ve never been so terrified,” she told Deseret News. “And I’ve been in a plane crash.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She had to pause lymphedema massage therapy for a month to ensure the infection was all gone; she worried about pushing it around in her arm, which was very swollen and painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;At Huntsman, a lymphovenous bypass surgery was the recommendation. A plastic surgeon takes the lymph tube and dumps it into the nearest vein, then sews it in. That helps the lymphatic fluid drain from the limb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The surgery wasn’t covered by her insurance, a decision she said was later overturned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Now she sees her lymphatic therapist weekly. And she also does self-massage and uses light therapy. She’s careful not to bonk her funny bone. And she wears long sleeves to mask the difference in the size of her arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 23:18:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOOElPdjY5aG9LaEdIRHFTSnVIS1ZmNXRwQ1JRYmtIeW42VnY0Mk1RaGZjN0tMWUwtUm8yZ0cwQ0lGNWZUYmN2WXlHSHlQUTd2Q09ISEZlbWhpNXlZcHhCNWxlbV9PeDdmMDNRQkIyd2NTVVRHakNKYkx2ckc3ZlM0XzVZUTJsdVI5R3NKMTA3UEdOVm1LbFlOeGItNkFpaHZhZFlXYVlKaw</guid></item><item><title>重磅研究中的休克自闭症和阿尔茨海默氏症的联系-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQdzVBaVJnZkpfUHZESWxFckNIOEFlLXcydkdUbzIxUk9RR1p6ekY3cE1iR2hiSE9wMS1mNzJpWmprVEFkNEZ2R29OU25KdEo1Zkd2aGxSS2dQU3labnlEZEpkNDM2VzNXdGhwT1ZqTW9HelBzZkZ0UjJvZEkxOXVIT1IwREgza3ZCZ21JV1JwVzB3blpC?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exposure to a toxic metal as far back as childhood could raise the risk of developing dementia later in life, a first-of-its-kind study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/canada/index.html" id="mol-79b5ebf0-6af6-11f0-b9c0-3167b0ebb072"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; studied more than 600,000 older US adults who were exposed as children to high levels of lead, a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14706935/popular-toothpaste-toxic-metals-linked-autism.html"&gt;toxic metal linked to autism, infertility and cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found people who grew up in the 1960s and 70s - when the use of lead in gasoline and paint was commonplace and unregulated - were 20 percent more likely to have memory issues later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These memory issues could develop into mild cognitive decline, a precursor to several forms of dementia, including &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-3d1f8ec0-6c05-11f0-8c8f-41c7c211c652" class=""&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease - the most common form which affects nearly 7 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, nearly nine in 10 Americans growing up at the time had 'dangerously high' levels of lead in their blood, suggesting damning long-term consequences for older Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research, unveiled at the world's largest dementia conference this week in Toronto, suggests the exposure is likely tied to leaded gasoline, which took nearly two decades to be phased out of cars sold in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the metal still lurks in older houses, meaning younger generations could face the same dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additional US-based studies revealed at the conference found even small levels of lead exposure could lead to more amyloid and tau plaques - which cause Alzheimer's disease - forming in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lead exposure dating to childhood could increase the risk of memory issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Maria C Carrillo, chief science officer and medical affairs lead of the Alzheimer's Association, who was not involved in the studies, said: 'Research suggests half the US population - more than 170 million people - were exposed to high lead levels in early childhood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This research sheds more light on the toxicity of lead related to brain health in older adults today.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results come as nearly 9 million adults in the US are living with some sort of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first study, from researchers at the University of Toronto, looked at approximately 600,000 US adults sourced from the American Community Survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants, all over the age of 65, were exposed to historically atmospheric levels of lead (HALL) between 1960 and 1974.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers did not analyze the source of the lead but believe that a higher density of automobile traffic, such as in urban areas, was the main contributor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team determined that 17 to 22 percent of people living in areas with moderate, high or extremely high atmospheric lead reported memory issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This translated to a 20 percent increased risk of memory problems compared to those without high lead exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Eric Brown, lead study author and associate chief of geriatric psychiatry at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, said: 'Our study may help us understand the pathways that contribute to some people developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When lead enters the body, it travels through the bloodstream and spreads to vital organs, including the brain. Once there, it infiltrates cells responsible for nutrients like calcium and iron, causing permanent damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no safe level of lead, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For decades, lead was added to paint, pipes and even some children's toys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers noted it was also used in gasoline to improve performance, and the process to phase it out did not start until 1975. It took roughly 20 years to fully remove lead from gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Esme Fuller-Thomson, senior study author and professor at the University of Toronto, said: 'When I was a child in 1976, our blood carried 15 times more lead than children's blood today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'An astonishing 88 percent of us had levels higher than 10 micrograms per deciliter, which are now considered dangerously high.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers warned while atmospheric lead levels have decreased, the metal can still be found in older homes without updated paint or pipes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, roughly 38 million homes throughout the country (one in four) were built prior to lead paint bans and may still contain the paint on windowsills, doorframes, stairs, railings, porches and fences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The EPA also estimates there are still about 9 million lead pipes in use across the US. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Brown urged those who have been exposed to atmospheric lead to focus on reducing other risk factors for dementia, including high blood pressure, smoking and social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers tied high lead exposure to gasoline used in the 1960s and '70s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An additional study presented this week at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference found that older adults who live within three miles of a lead-releasing facility were more likely to have memory and thinking issues than those who lived further away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These facilities include those that manufacture glass, mixed concrete or computers and other electronics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team, from the University of California, Davis, assessed 2,379 older patients who had an average age of 74. All lived in California and were taken from two studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to two years earlier, participants who lived three miles from a lead-releasing facility scored lower on verbal episodic memory tests - recalling personal experiences - and overall cognition than those who lived further away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And every three miles farther a participant lived from one of these facilities, their memory scores improved an additional five percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kathryn Conlon, senior study author and associate professor of environmental epidemiology at UC Davis, said: 'Our results indicate that lead exposure in adulthood could contribute to worse cognitive performance within a few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Despite tremendous progress on lead abatement, studies have shown there is no safe level of exposure - and half of US children have detectable levels of lead in their blood.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Conlon also found there were 7,507 lead-releasing facilities in the US in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To reduce exposure, she said people living nearby should keep their homes clean to avoid the accumulation of lead-contaminated dust, remove their shoes when coming inside and place dust mats inside and outside to avoid tracking contaminated dust indoors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows populations served by drinking water with the highest levels of lead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A third study from Purdue University exposed human brain cells to lead in zero, 15 and 50 parts per billion, simulating the kind of lead exposure people might experience through contaminated water or air. The EPA's action level for lead in drinking water is 15 parts per billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found neurons were more electrically active than those with no exposure, suggesting early signs of cognitive dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There was also an increase in amyloid and tau proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Junkai Xie, lead study author and post-doctoral research associate in chemical engineering at Purdue University, said: 'Our results show that lead exposure isn't just a short-term concern; it may set the stage for cognitive problems decades later.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  The Lancet Commission on liver cancer found that most cases were preventable if &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/21/alcohol-cancer-risks-warning-labels-charities-say" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;, fatty liver disease and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/27/scientists-warn-90-of-hepatitis-b-sufferers-remain-unaware-of-silent-killer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;levels of viral hepatitis&lt;/a&gt; B and C were reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The commission set out several recommendations for policymakers, which it estimated could reduce the incidence of liver cancer cases by 2% to 5% each year by 2050, preventing 9m to 17m new cases of liver cancer and saving 8 million to 15 million lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"society","tags":[{"id":"society/cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Cancer"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"society/obesity","type":"Keyword","title":"Obesity"},{"id":"society/vaccines","type":"Keyword","title":"Vaccines and immunisation"},{"id":"politics/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health policy"},{"id":"society/hepatitis-b","type":"Keyword","title":"Hepatitis B"},{"id":"society/hepatitis-c","type":"Keyword","title":"Hepatitis C"},{"id":"world/world","type":"Keyword","title":"World news"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/rachel-hall","type":"Contributor","title":"Rachel Hall","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2022/11/17/Rachel_Hall.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=ebf88b36e5b5ece33a2d5bb1bf844d50","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2022/11/17/Rachel_Hall_Next_Gen.png?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=19a035691b77985e87f022431bae5766"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Main section"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"UK news"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-home-news","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Home News"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"society/2025/jul/28/lifestyle-changes-and-vaccination-could-prevent-most-liver-cancer-cases","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Jian Zhou at Fudan University in China, who led the research, said: “Liver cancer is a growing health issue around the world. It is one of the most challenging cancers to treat, with five-year survival rates ranging from approximately 5% to 30%. We risk seeing close to a doubling of cases and deaths from liver cancer over the next quarter of a century without urgent action to reverse this trend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer death. The number of deaths is predicted to grow from 760,000 in 2022 to 1.37 million in 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Previous analyses have predicted that the number of new liver cancer cases will nearly double from 870,000 in 2022 to 1.52m in 2050, mostly due to population growth and ageing populations, with the largest increases expected in Africa. At present, more than 40% of the global liver cancer cases occur in China due to its relatively high rates of hepatitis B infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One of the fastest growing causes of liver cancer globally is fatty liver disease, and this is expected to rise because of increasing rates of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One-third of the global population is estimated to have metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) – previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, where fat builds up in a person’s liver – though it can be prevented by eating a balanced diet, being physically active and potentially losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Only 20% to 30% of people with MASLD go on to develop the more severe form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which can lead to liver cancer. The commission said the proportion of liver cancer cases associated with MASH was projected to increase from 8% in 2022 to 11% in 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The second fastest growing cause is alcohol, with associated liver cases projected to increase from 19% in 2022 to 21% in 2050. In contrast, the proportion of liver cancer cases linked to hepatitis B is expected to decrease from 39% in 2022 to 37% in 2050, while hepatitis C-related cases are projected to drop from 29% to 26%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The commission author Prof Hashem B El-Serag of Baylor College of Medicine in the US said: “Liver cancer was once thought to occur mainly in patients with viral hepatitis or alcohol-related liver disease. However, today, rising rates of obesity are an increasing risk factor for liver cancer, primarily due to the increase in cases of excess fat around the liver.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The commission’s recommendations included that governments boost HBV vaccination and implement universal screening for adults; introduce minimum alcohol unit pricing and sugar taxes along with warning labels; invest in early detection of liver damage and cancer; and improve palliative care for sufferers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The commission author Prof Valérie Paradis of Beaujon hospital in France said: “There is an urgent need to raise awareness within society about the severity of the growing health issue of rising liver cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Compared with other cancers, liver cancer is very hard to treat but has more distinct risk factors, which help define specific prevention strategies. With joint and continuous efforts, we believe many liver cancer cases can be prevented, and both the survival and quality of patients with liver cancer will be considerably improved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Matt Hoare, an associate professor in hepatology at the University of Cambridge’s Early &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Institute, said liver cancer was “unlike many other cancers” in that the death rate was still rising, with the causes varying by region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He said public health policy changes have proven effective, since Japan had successfully reduced its death rate by implementing preventive policies and improving detection to find cancers earlier. His team is seeking to identify new ways to spot patients with liver disease who will develop cancer through DNA sequencing of the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPVlFmSVh0dFNmdWRaZnFTbkl5dk11U2MwTTJHYnBlemE1S0U1ZVFqNHBTUi1tcW9nS2ZyZ3ZWVFh1NFJ5cGh5eUIxcUVJSFY2bDlqUVl1NmtiQzdzU1htRFZwN0lhZzRUQmZVZk5FeDZwWk9NZkFwYlVpNV8yUWw0cHBqR1l3V2FpdkxpZzMwTS1kQlpBX2dCVjZvandzaGQzaWRKY1U1dmFDeWRXZEF5akhQNDNTVWNCRWhv</guid></item><item><title>万步迷思：这是您真正需要的-德撒律新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxONnNHUHgyRTNsN0RRaE5BeUtWZGNTMTZCTEJEcU1XMUtTakhhWjJMNXRDR1lOQzF6cXFmTV9mZHpNTk0zZDV3bGpUaGtZZC1ZYk5faHhGRXNHbzNucl8zQjdxNE11bm41RVBTMzZHVElNTWxZbDFRSUR1NEhoUEpnS0ZrLTNkazJoVC1qY2ZLazlYcXNSdFNlTGFzZXZvX2cxLUFJUjZkbUJEVFVCQXNySg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body mt-4"&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__key-points-list col-12"&gt;&lt;div class="key-points-list-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research suggests walking 7,000 steps daily offers the same health benefits as 10,000 steps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walking a minimum of 7,000 steps can minimize the risk of early death by 47%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increasing from 2,000 to 4,000 daily steps is linked to significant health gains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Take a walk, 10,000-step goal. A new study says you might be too demanding when it comes to boosting health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Research from the University of Sydney shows that walking at least 7,000 steps a day offers about the same health benefits as the widely touted 10,000 steps we’ve heard about for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Just 7,000 steps a day can reduce the risk of premature death by up to 47%, per the study in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/home" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/home"&gt;The Lancet Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. The study focused on how much impact different daily step counts had on the risk of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The team also examined the relationship between walking a certain number of steps and the risk of developing various diseases, including cancer, type 2 diabetes, dementia and depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Aiming for 7,000 steps is a realistic goal based on our findings, which assessed health outcomes in a range of areas that hadn’t been looked at before,” said professor Melody Ding, who led the study. “However, for those who cannot yet achieve 7,000 steps a day, even small increases in step counts — such as increasing from 2,000 to 4,000 steps a day, are associated with significant health gain," she said in a written statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We know daily step count is linked to living longer, but we now also have evidence that walking at least 7,000 steps a day can significantly improve eight major health outcomes, including reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia and depressive symptoms,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="The-study's-mechanics" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;The study’s mechanics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The study by researchers at the University of Sydney looked at data from nearly five dozen studies conducted between 2014 and 2025 in more than 10 countries, including the U.S., Australia, United Kingdom and Japan. It is the “largest and most comprehensive review to date,” per the researchers from the university’s School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers used pedometers, accelerometers and other fitness trackers to see how far study participants walked each day. Beginning with 2,000 steps, experts compared the health outcomes, looking at 1,000-step increments to see if the numbers made a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Per the news release, compared to 2,000 steps a day, they found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walking 7,000 steps a day reduced risk of death by 47% — almost identical to the benefit of walking 10,000 steps per day. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dementia risk dropped by 38% at 7,000 steps a day, with just a 7% extra reduction at 10,000 steps. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Risk of type 2 diabetes fell by 22% from walking 10,000 steps a day and reduced to 27% at 12,000 steps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Significant health improvements were seen when people increased their average daily steps from 2,000 to between 5,000 and 7,000 steps. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That doesn’t mean you should slow down if you’re already hitting the 10,000-step benchmark, said Dr. Katherine Owen, co-author and the study’s chief analyst. But she added that the health benefits of the extra steps are “modest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Ding said the study “helps to shift the focus from perfection to progress. Even small increases in daily movement can lead to meaningful health improvements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;More study is needed to see if set goals should vary based on age, health status and region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="10000-steps-a-made-up-number" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;10,000 steps a made-up number&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The study is not the first to say 10,000 steps isn’t really scientific when it comes to health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://in.nau.edu/ucan/myth-debunked-10000-steps-a-day-is-required-for-good-health/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://in.nau.edu/ucan/myth-debunked-10000-steps-a-day-is-required-for-good-health/"&gt;Northern Arizona University&lt;/a&gt; reported in 2023, the number has been ingrained for years, but it’s not like a scientific study declared that a magic number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Rather it can be traced more than 60 years back to Japan, when a marketing campaign for a pedometer called the “manpo-kei” gave the notion the patina of settled fact. “Manpo-kei” means “10,000 steps meter.” And it was chosen because it was “catchy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The 2023 release notes other things to consider when raising or evaluating your activity level, including your own fitness level, intensity — which is needed to boost heart health — as an amble doesn’t do much, and what kind of health outcome you want to achieve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Per the article, “Research suggests that moderate-intensity physical activity for at least 150 minutes a week or vigorous-intensity activity for 75 minutes a week is a helpful benchmark for cardiovascular health — regardless of the number of steps. This can provide a gentle guide of what to shoot for, however, it’s best to focus on your own individual starting point and increase gradually from there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 21:06:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxONnNHUHgyRTNsN0RRaE5BeUtWZGNTMTZCTEJEcU1XMUtTakhhWjJMNXRDR1lOQzF6cXFmTV9mZHpNTk0zZDV3bGpUaGtZZC1ZYk5faHhGRXNHbzNucl8zQjdxNE11bm41RVBTMzZHVElNTWxZbDFRSUR1NEhoUEpnS0ZrLTNkazJoVC1qY2ZLazlYcXNSdFNlTGFzZXZvX2cxLUFJUjZkbUJEVFVCQXNySg</guid></item><item><title>23岁的“反vax”妇女在拒绝化疗后死亡-调查-英国广播公司</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE45dGRLU2taa3VkaGkyNlg3b3pmLVg4eFEzSXFObTRZM1lVX1dvMFJDaWRZZGJzMk1mQnh4QVkzU1VleWpLNmdERlEyTG9uaUlvNFZsWFU2Rmk5Z9IBX0FVX3lxTFB5WHFVNi00M1doQ0hIMmUyTVJQS2E1b0g2QXE0blRJVWNzRlMwVDlpaERfMm1vQUVKRjdBLTltajF2RlZJeDc2aWRWQjlWb3pfNTJyZ1VtMG1LNm1vWEFj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;'Anti-vax' woman died after refusing chemotherapy&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 jSIeFi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Nathan Bevan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News, South East&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/adc4/live/5831fd10-4df6-11f0-bb1d-1741330db98d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/adc4/live/5831fd10-4df6-11f0-bb1d-1741330db98d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/adc4/live/5831fd10-4df6-11f0-bb1d-1741330db98d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/adc4/live/5831fd10-4df6-11f0-bb1d-1741330db98d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/adc4/live/5831fd10-4df6-11f0-bb1d-1741330db98d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/adc4/live/5831fd10-4df6-11f0-bb1d-1741330db98d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/adc4/live/5831fd10-4df6-11f0-bb1d-1741330db98d.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/adc4/live/5831fd10-4df6-11f0-bb1d-1741330db98d.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Gabriel &amp;amp; Sebastian Shemirani Paloma, smiling at the camera as she sits on the wall outside King's College, Cambridge, with the windows of the chapel illuminated and a dark blue twilight sky behind her.

The study’s findings suggest that those effects may be much more widespread than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IB6MOLLFS5FMXN5OIGFOJYTTY4"&gt;“Some adverse aspects of long COVID may not be apparent until some point in the future,” he said. “That suggests the condition could be more common than current estimates reflect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4L4PVDGJ4FAHPMHDQRDYSLZJ5E"&gt;The researchers were interested in how the virus that causes COVID-19 interacts with metabolic health. Roberts, who spent a decade studying diabetes and obesity at the National Institutes of Health, said the team wanted to explore what he called a “reciprocal relationship” between COVID-19 and chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MLALN7CGIJE53HEGHRB5HSEMTA"&gt;“If you had already had metabolic disease, like obesity, diabetes or hypertension, that meant that if you got COVID, it was going to be worse,” he explained. “On the other hand, there was a potential risk of new-onset metabolic disease after COVID.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="N5S6VCENX5FGDLWDLIT36MGEHE"&gt;To test this, the researchers used rhesus macaques at OHSU’s Oregon National Primate Research Center. The Hillsboro facility has &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/06/despite-protests-nih-renews-137-million-for-ohsu-primate-center.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/06/despite-protests-nih-renews-137-million-for-ohsu-primate-center.html"&gt;long been the target of animal rights groups&lt;/a&gt;, who have raised concerns about disease, lab conditions and the ethics of animal studies.

Their brains are wired to seek out food more aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While children with this drive can regulate their eating with whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins, ultra-processed foods, which are packed with refined sugars, industrial fats, and artificial additives, can overwhelm their brain’s natural satiety signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These foods are designed to bypass fullness cues. Sugary or salty snacks trigger a rush of dopamine in the brain far more robust than apples or grilled chicken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This dopamine rush causes the brain to seek out those same good feelings over and over again, often in the form of reaching for junk foods over whole produce and lean protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Having a strong food reward drive causes a person to crave food constantly, even when they’re not hungry, and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11696959/One-EIGHT-adults-addicted-highly-processed-food.html"&gt;struggle to stop eating&lt;/a&gt; when they’re full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists recommend &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/wellness-us/nutrition/article-13143061/avoid-ultra-processed-foods-groceries-price.html"&gt;avoiding ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; in the grocery store altogether and reserving them for special occasions. Keeping them in the house while trying to moderate a child’s eating habits rarely works, and not keeping them in the home is typically more successful, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is estimated that Americans obtain roughly 70 percent of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods and a growing body of research has linked a diet full of them increases a person's risk of chronic diseases including diabetes and cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ultra-process foods have been linked to diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and depression &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who score highest on the Reward-based Eating Drive (RED) scale, a self-reported test on lack of satiety and a struggle to stop eating, are more likely to have &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0101350"&gt;a high BMI&lt;/a&gt;, obesity, and weight fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultra-palatable foods activate the brain’s opioid and dopamine systems. The dopamine rush keeps people coming back for more, while the opioid effect dulls feelings of fullness, stimulates endorphins, and increases cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has shown that children with a strong food reward drive can regulate how much whole produce and lean protein they eat, but struggle doing the same with ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has suggested that some people are genetically predisposed to having &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2007/10/eating-to-live#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20DC%2D%2DScience%20has,to%20eat%20and%20caloric%20consumption."&gt;fewer dopamine receptors&lt;/a&gt;, requring more junk food to attain the same flood of dopamine that hooks people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genetics don't solely influence eating behavior, though. If a child is frequently rewarded with junk food or it's constantly available, they are more likely to develop dopamine-driven habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Parents have a significant influence on their children’s eating habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study found that around &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7583369/"&gt;21 percent of parents&lt;/a&gt; used food as a reward, which is associated with emotional overeating in their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kerri Boutelle, a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the University of California, San Diego's School of Medicine, works with children struggling with their weight and overeating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her years of research have shown that children, even siblings, show different responses to ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘One child would eat half of the ice cream cone and put it down,’ she told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/28/nx-s1-5476705/ultra-processed-food-kids-health"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;. They have a low food reward drive, meaning that ultra-processed foods do not significantly alter their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They just eat to get full, and then they move on,’ Boutelle said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ultra-processed foods, including fast foods, chips, and sugary cereals, are designed to bypass fullness cues and trigger a rush of dopamine in the brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The dopamine rush keeps people coming back for more, while the opioid effect dulls feelings of fullness, stimulates endorphins, and increases cravings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other child, who has a high food reward drive, would gobble up their ice cream cone and finish the other child’s too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They want to eat all the time, and it doesn't matter if they're full,’ Boutelle added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Those kids are going to gain weight in today's environment. I always tell parents, the environment today tricks kids into overeating.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reward-based eating is similar to but different from food addiction, which causes obsessive thoughts about food, a loss of control when eating, and continued overeating despite existing health problems, such as obesity or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 20 percent of American children, more than 14 million, are obese. Roughly 300,000 of them have type 1 or type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Boutelle recommends that parents avoid buying ultra-processed foods altogether, but if they do, limit their purchases to three items, as having a wide variety can increase the risk of overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘What you can do as a parent is make your home as safe as it can be for your children,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living within miles of the ocean breeze may be linked to a longer life, but you shouldn't count on the same benefits if you live in a riverside city, suggests a recent study.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers from The Ohio State University have analyzed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/population+data/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;population data&lt;/a&gt;—including life expectancy—in more than 66,000 census tracts throughout the U.S. and compared it based on proximity to waterways. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935125012320" target="_blank"&gt;Their study&lt;/a&gt; was published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Environmental Research&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A correlation between longer life expectancy and water was clear for those who live within about 30 miles of an ocean or gulf. But for those who live in urban settings and near an inland body of water larger than 4 square miles, the opposite was true. Rural residents who live near water may also reap some lifespan advantages, according to the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Overall, the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/coastal+residents/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;coastal residents&lt;/a&gt; were expected to live a year or more longer than the 79-year average, and those who lived in more &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/urban+areas/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;urban areas&lt;/a&gt; near inland rivers and lakes were likely to die by about 78 or so. The coastal residents probably live longer due to a variety of intertwined factors," said lead researcher Jianyong "Jamie" Wu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis suggested that milder temperatures, better air quality, more opportunities for recreation, better transportation, less susceptibility to drought, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/higher+incomes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;higher incomes&lt;/a&gt; could all be contributors to a better outlook for coastal residents compared to those who live inland.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"On the other side, pollution, poverty, lack of safe opportunities to be physically active and an increased risk of flooding are likely drivers of these differences," said Yanni Cao, a postdoctoral researcher who worked on the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most critical difference the researchers found is that coastal areas experience fewer hot days and lower maximum temperatures compared to inland water areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has found a connection between living near water and better health measures, including higher physical activity levels, lower obesity rates and improved heart health. That prompted Wu to wonder if there could be a link between "blue space" living and longer lives, and how that relationship might differ depending on the type of neighborhood people call home, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We thought it was possible that any type of 'blue space' would offer some beneficial effects, and we were surprised to find such a significant and clear difference between those who live near &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/coastal+waters/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;coastal waters&lt;/a&gt; and those who live near inland waters," said Wu, an assistant professor of environmental health sciences at The Ohio State University College of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found a clear difference—in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/coastal+areas/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;coastal areas&lt;/a&gt;, people are living longer," said Wu, adding that the study is the first to comprehensively and systematically examine the relationship between various types of "blue space" and longevity in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cao said she was especially curious about how this data might provide insights into the trends in life expectancy in the U.S. compared to other wealthy nations. In the past several years, the U.S. has experienced a sharper decline and a slower rebound in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/life+expectancy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; than peer countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's likely that various social determinants of health, including complex environmental factors, that contribute to health inequities are playing a key role in the differences we saw," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Living near the ocean is linked to longer life expectancy in both urban and rural areas.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People near large inland water bodies tend to have shorter lifespans—but only in cities.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Environmental factors like heat, air quality, elevation, and income help explain the difference.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Rural communities near lakes and rivers may still benefit from their local blue spaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COLUMBUS, Ohio —&lt;/strong&gt; A new study calls into question the general assumptions about waterfront living, showing that Americans living close to the coast tend to live longer lives, while those near inland waters like lakes and rivers actually have shorter life expectancies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s long been thought that living near waterways brings benefits for everyone. But it turns out that the location of your blue space matters far more than simply living near any water at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-researchers-analyze-66-000-communities-nationwide"&gt;Researchers Analyze 66,000+ Communities Nationwide&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Ohio State University analyzed data from 66,263 census tracts across the continental United States, creating one of the most comprehensive studies of its kind. They compared &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/life-expectancy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; data from 2010–2015 with proximity to both coastal waters and inland water bodies, while accounting for dozens of other factors that influence longevity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Americans living within 31 miles &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/childhood-blue-spaces-adult-wellbeing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;of the coast&lt;/a&gt; showed consistently higher life expectancy rates compared to areas near large inland water bodies. The average American in the study lived 78.3 years, but that number varied based on their relationship with water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-climate-air-quality-and-income-differ-near-coasts-vs-inland-waters"&gt;How Climate, Air Quality, and Income Differ Near Coasts vs Inland Waters&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The differences between coastal and inland water environments are stark. Areas near inland waters averaged 21 scorching days per year with temperatures above 95°F, while coastal areas saw just 2.2 such days. Coastal residents also breathe cleaner air, with lower levels of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/air-pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;air pollution&lt;/a&gt; and wildfire smoke.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Money&lt;/a&gt; plays a major role too. Mean household income near coastal waters reached $91,075 compared to just $67,774 near inland water bodies — a gap of more than $23,000 per year. Higher incomes often translate into better healthcare access, nutrition, and overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Coastal geography may also provide logistical and health advantages. These areas tend to feature flatter terrain and better transportation access, while inland water regions are more mountainous and harder to navigate, affecting everything from emergency response times to daily stress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ocean acts as a natural climate moderator, helping &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/air-purifier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;purify air&lt;/a&gt; and regulate temperature. Coastal areas experience less extreme weather overall, with fewer dangerously cold days and more stable seasonal patterns. Recreational access to beaches and opportunities for outdoor activity, such as &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/swimming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt; or walking along the shore, may also offer added health benefits not always matched by inland water features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-inland-water-impacts-life-expectancy-differently-in-cities-and-rural-areas"&gt;Why Inland Water Impacts Life Expectancy Differently in Cities and Rural Areas&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s where the research gets particularly interesting: the negative effects of inland waters primarily impact urban areas, while &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/rural/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;rural communities&lt;/a&gt; near inland waters actually see modest life expectancy benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In cities, proximity to large inland water bodies correlates with shorter lifespans. But in rural areas, the relationship flips. Urban inland waters face greater pollution, flood risks, and air quality challenges, while rural inland waters can offer recreational and aesthetic benefits without the same environmental hazards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This urban-rural split reveals that context matters enormously when evaluating how water proximity affects health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-findings-mean-for-public-health"&gt;What the Findings Mean for Public Health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These results, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935125012320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Environmental Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, carry serious consequences for the millions of Americans living near inland waters. The Great Lakes region, mountain lake communities, and riverside cities may need to address environmental factors that could be undermining residents’ health and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/longer-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team acknowledged limitations in their work, including the inability to measure actual water quality or track how individuals personally interact with nearby water bodies. They also couldn’t include behavioral factors like smoking, diet, and exercise in their analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the massive scale of the study — covering &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/where-you-live-heart-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;virtually every American community&lt;/a&gt; — provides robust evidence for the patterns they identified. The consistency of results across multiple statistical approaches strengthens confidence in their conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than assuming all waterfront living offers the same benefits, Americans might want to consider whether their &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/blue-spaces/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blue space&lt;/a&gt; comes with an ocean breeze or sits inland. The difference, the authors suggest, may be associated with meaningful differences in health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Ohio State University analyzed life expectancy data from 66,263 census tracts across the continental United States from 2010–2015. They measured proximity to coastal waters using distance thresholds of 0, 20, and 50 kilometers, while proximity to inland water bodies was determined by whether census tracts contained water bodies larger than 10 or 20 square kilometers. The team used multiple regression models including linear regression, multi-level regression, and spatial regression to examine relationships while controlling for environmental factors (climate, air quality, elevation, land cover), socioeconomic variables (income, poverty rates, demographics), and geographic characteristics. They also conducted sensitivity analyses and used mutual information modeling to identify key differentiating factors between coastal and inland water environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found that proximity to coastal waters within 50 kilometers was positively associated with life expectancy, while proximity to inland water bodies larger than 20 square kilometers was negatively associated with life expectancy. Census tracts near coastal waters showed consistently higher life expectancy compared to those near inland waters. Key environmental differences included: coastal areas experienced fewer hot days (2.2 vs 21.0 days above 35°C), lower maximum temperatures (34.3°C vs 37.7°C), better air quality with less PM2.5 pollution (0.52 vs 0.78 μg/m³), and higher household incomes ($91,075 vs $67,774). Urban-rural analysis revealed that inland waters negatively affected life expectancy in urban areas but positively affected it in rural areas, while coastal proximity remained beneficial in both settings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study acknowledged several limitations including the use of cross-sectional ecological data that limits causal inference, the inability to measure actual water quality or recreational use patterns, and lack of data on individual behavioral factors like smoking, diet, and physical activity. The proximity-based exposure measurements may not fully capture individuals’ actual interactions with blue spaces. There were also potential temporal mismatches between exposure timing and life expectancy estimates, and the possibility of residual confounding from unmeasured healthcare access and quality factors.&lt;/p&gt;
