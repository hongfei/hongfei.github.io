Tech moguls swear by it, Hollywood stars insist it keeps them trim. Britain's former prime minister &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68129595" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Rishi Sunak&lt;/a&gt; once spoke of starting his week with a 36-hour fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So far the science has seemed supportive. Research suggests that extending the overnight fast may improve metabolism, aid cellular repair and perhaps even prolong life. Nutritionists, however, have long warned that skipping meals is no magic bullet - and may be risky for those with underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Intermittent fasting compresses eating into a short daily window, often eight hours, leaving a 16-hour gap without food. Other time-restricted diets, like the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/menus/intermittent_restricted_day_5" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;5:2 plan&lt;/a&gt;, limit calories on certain days rather than hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Now, the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1871402125000955" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;first large-scale study&lt;/a&gt; of its kind raises a more serious red flag. Researchers, analysing data from more than 19,000 adults, found that those who confined their eating to less than eight hours a day faced a 135% higher risk of dying from&lt;b id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt; &lt;/b&gt;cardiovascular disease - death due to heart and blood vessel diseases - than people who ate over 12-14 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;An elevated cardiovascular risk means that, based on a person's health, lifestyle and medical data, they are more likely than others in the study to develop heart-related problems such as heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The link to overall mortality - deaths from any cause - was weaker and inconsistent, but the cardiovascular risk persisted across age, sex and lifestyle groups even after rigorous testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In other words, the study found only a weak and inconsistent link between time-restricted eating and overall deaths. But the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease was sharply higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The authors stress that the study doesn't prove cause and effect. But the signal is striking enough to challenge the narrative of fasting as a risk-free path to better health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Researchers tracked American adults over eight years. To understand their eating habits, participants were asked on two separate days - about two weeks apart - to recall everything they ate and drank. From these "dietary recalls", scientists estimated each person's average eating window and treated it as representative of their long-term routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Those who ate within an eight-hour window faced a 91% higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease than those who spread meals over 12-14 hours, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They found the elevated cardiovascular risk was consistent across socioeconomic groups, and strongest among smokers and people with diabetes or existing heart disease - suggesting they should be especially cautious about long-term, narrow eating windows. The link held even after adjusting for diet quality, meal and snack frequency, and other lifestyle factors, researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;I asked the researchers how we should read the finding that heart-related deaths go up so dramatically, but overall deaths don't - is it biology, or bias in the data?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Diet is a major driver of diabetes and heart disease, so an association with higher cardiovascular mortality is not unexpected, said Victor Wenze Zhong, the lead author of the peer-reviewed study in Diabetes &amp;amp; Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research and Reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The unexpected finding is that sticking to a short eating window less than eight hours over years was linked to increased death risk from cardiovascular disease," says Prof Zhong, an epidemiologist at Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine in China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That runs counter to the popular belief - supported by short-term studies lasting only a few months to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M23-0052?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;a year&lt;/a&gt; - that time-restricted eating improves heart and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In an accompanying editorial in the same journal, Anoop Misra, a leading endocrinologist, weighs the promise and pitfalls of intermittent fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;On the upside, he says, multiple trials and analyses suggest it can promote weight loss, improve insulin sensitivity, lower blood pressure and enhance lipid profiles, with some evidence of anti-inflammatory benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It may also help people manage blood sugar without rigid calorie counting, fits easily with cultural or religious fasting practices, and is simple to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"However, the potential downsides include nutrient deficiencies, increased cholesterol, excessive hunger, irritability, headaches and reduced adherence over time," says Prof Misra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"For people with diabetes, unmonitored fasting risks dangerous drops in blood sugar; and promotes junk food intake during eating window. For older adults or those with chronic conditions, prolonged fasting may worsen frailty or accelerate muscle loss." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is not the first time intermittent fasting has faced scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A rigorous &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2771095?guestAccessKey=444bbcb2-7e13-4dc6-998f-5de5e27aa19e&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=092820" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;three-month study &lt;/a&gt;published in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2020 found that participants lost only a small amount of weight, much of which may have come from muscle. Another &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2784658?utm_source=chatgpt.com" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; indicated that intermittent fasting may produce side effects such as weakness, hunger, dehydration, headaches and difficulty concentrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The new study, Prof Misra says, now adds a more troubling caveat - a possible link to higher cardiovascular risk, at least in certain groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;I asked Prof Zhong what he would advise clinicians and the public to take away from  the latest findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He said people with heart disease or diabetes should be cautious about adopting an eight-hour eating window. The findings point to the need for "personalised" dietary advice, grounded in health status and evolving evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Based on the evidence as of now, focusing on what people eat appears to be more important than focusing on the time when they eat. At least, people may consider not to adopt eight-hour eating window for a long time either for the purpose of preventing cardiovascular disease or for improving longevity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Clearly, for now, the message is less about abandoning fasting altogether and more about tailoring it to an individual's risk profile. Until the evidence is clearer, the safest bet may be to focus less on the clock and more on the plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2025 01:22:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE8tdzc3Z3N2ZXZ4LVlEMVk1SVJIVWtacl9oOVNJQjQtNjMwR1VJRGJ0dVV3cTFGQXJCWW4zUHdxdmNWTUJiZ09teGtua0QyNXVydnhKTWd5MFpfUdIBX0FVX3lxTE5xSzBqN2ZMaERWZmpYUElsTzA4OWtFa0NJYXNTRDBJUXBuWUlKaU81SFh0YVJmTWlQeU9FbDBBY21KOU5IaUdJQVBUTU5jSkxTTVpNUXdtUHJ5TlBYMDRV</guid></item><item><title>CDPHE提醒公众注意梅萨县的麻疹暴露地点- KDVR</title><link>https://kdvr.com/news/local/cdphe-alerts-public-of-measles-exposure-locations-in-mesa-county/</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

The acid kick-starts a chain reaction in the lungs which causes inflammation in the airways, resulting in asthma developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also found that oleic acid – a fatty acid often found in vegetable oils, particularly olive oil – has the opposite effect and can suppress inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Prior to this study, many suspected that childhood obesity was causing this form of asthma,' said senior researcher Dr David Hill, an attending physician at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But we were observing neutrophilic asthma in children who were not obese, which is why we suspected there might be another mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We found in pre-clinical work and studies in children that diets containing certain saturated long chain fatty acids can cause neutrophilic asthma independent from obesity.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;File image:  More than five million Britons have asthma.

Ramsay Farah, beloved husband, father, grandfather, and dedicated physician, who left this world on Wednesday August 27, 2025, at the age of 80 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;Born Saturday, April 7, 1945, in Beirut, Lebanon, he was the son of the late Wadih J. Farah and the late Olivia (Risk) Farah. By their influence Dr. Farah pursued medicine with distinction, graduating from the American University of Beirut before completing residency and fellowship training at the University of Maryland Hospital in Pediatrics. He went on to earn a Master of Public Health in Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University, where he became a lifelong Fellow of the American College of Preventive Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;For over five decades, Dr. Farah served communities in Maryland and beyond as a pediatrician, public health leader, and pioneer in addiction medicine. He founded and directed Phoenix Health Center and Phoenix Behavioral Center in Hagerstown, where he cared for countless patients with compassion and dedication. He held numerous leadership roles, including Chief Medical Officer at Phoenix of Health, Medical Director of Sierra Military Health Services, Director of Region 5 for American Society of Addiction Medicine, and North East Regional Medical Director at United Healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;A Distinguished Fellow of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, Dr. Farah was recognized nationally for his expertise in substance use disorders, complex pain management, and integrated behavioral health. He also served on the Maryland State Board of Physicians, chaired state advisory committees on practice standards, and helped shape medical policy for the betterment of patients across the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;Throughout his career, Dr. Farah received numerous awards recognizing both his medical leadership and his community service. He was honored with multiple Governor’s Citations from the State of Maryland, a Special Congressional Recognition from the United States Congress, and commendations from the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of Maryland presented him with its Distinguished Board of Trustees Award and President’s Award, while the American Heart Association, American Cancer Society, and American Lung Association acknowledged his many contributions to public health. Locally, he was recognized by the Washington County Medical Society, the Arc of Washington County, and the Hagerstown Junior College, among others. As a proud Rotarian, he was a Paul Harris Fellow with four sapphires and served as District Governor. His accolades also extended to cultural and civic life, including recognition from the Maryland Symphony Orchestra, which he helped found, and proclamations from world leaders for his role in establishing the Anwar Sadat Chair for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland. These honors reflected not only his professional excellence but also his deep commitment to service and humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;Dr. Farah held an unshakable faith in the transformative power of medicine. However, his most enduring legacy extends far beyond his professional achievements. It lives on in the countless lives he touched along the way. To his patients, he was a steadfast beacon of comfort and hope; to his colleagues, a wise and compassionate mentor; and to his family, a devoted husband and father whose generosity, kindness, and passion inspired all who knew him. His presence will be profoundly missed, but his spirit and influence will forever remain in the hearts of those he served and loved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 css-as8hyk css-9l3uo3"&gt;He is survived by his devoted wife of 60 years, Elizabeth Farah, son Patrick W. Farah and wife Tanya, daughters, Jessica Farah Hafer and husband Alexander and Veronica Nadia Farah, grandchildren, Ramsay P. Farah, Ramsay A. Hafer, Frederick A. Farah, Xavier A. Hafer, Elizabeth N. Farah, Brigitte M. Farah, Julius Ramsay Farah and Paris S.

								&lt;p&gt;SANTA FE, N.M. – The New Mexico Department of Health issued a public health &lt;a href="https://z5art88ab.cc.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001TA08GgsLQdCEx28imA1FOiJdJlrMz2y86GGcAPQl96r5-HGv0avtDGKNi6QcoMe8qEY7FRnBtTVIaCG9uiTYt7cLDHRKK9cJ9NQ3G-Bk6n6lgI12s_bCGtpu5aF1Ro8cA3XwSkzTJhVndv4OI0AWwCODeoJ5jHUuH20kuvd4gdnQJWbacmrb9E3kLrMcPjuW-nQxYsrQbOvg4Eq5gpRiVoCEOiupt4zj-ll00Xvv_sdwmLPAqQqQKgGrT4A8D-OL&amp;amp;c=vndllv36sPGFm3DK8QSp132Y7rmZOOq1DMAZ0cVpbAT5q-_yEiHSTQ==&amp;amp;ch=c7d8FxCHdUZDgU3DZ2vhOrzPnbUUJMfzYg7rzeObb7y03NlEtYIeXw==" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; Friday to maximize the availability of COVID-19 vaccines this fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order comes after the&lt;a href="https://www.kob.com/ap-top-news/fda-approves-updated-covid-19-shots-with-limits-for-some-kids-and-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved updated COVID-19 vaccine formulas&lt;/a&gt;, but with new limits on who could qualify for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA is mostly limiting COVID-19 vaccines to those 65 and older, while exceptions exist for younger persons with underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NMDOH says its own order comes in response to some pharmacies saying they cannot give the vaccine unless recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an advisory group to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ACIP has yet to convene and act on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order directs NMDOH to work with New Mexico’s Board of Pharmacy to remove potential barriers and ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines at pharmacies across the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important for New Mexicans to know the New Mexico Department of Health is committed to keeping residents safe as we enter the 2025 – 2026 respiratory virus season,” said Health Secretary Gina DeBlassie. “This order will remove obstacles to vaccination access.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state expects the updated COVID-19 vaccine to start arriving in New Mexico within the next few weeks.  &lt;/p&gt;

Her four-year-old daughter Lily had reached the device and swallowed what she told her parents was a quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But an X-ray at the hospital that day revealed she had actually swallowed a small button battery taken from within one of the tags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marie said: ‘As a mom, when we figured out it was a button battery, I was like, okay, her whole insides are burned out. I was on the bathroom floor of the hospital crying.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Swallowing a button battery is a serious &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-11973227/Mother-issues-warning-parents-daughter-swallowed-battery-toy-wand.html"&gt;medical emergency&lt;/a&gt;. Once inside the body, the moist environment of the esophagus or throat completes an electrical circuit between the battery's positive and negative terminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A chemical reaction occurs when the circuit is completed, generating sodium hydroxide, a powerful, industrial-strength &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14027025/terrified-mom-toddler-toy-battery-swallow-throat-hospital.html"&gt;chemical that burns&lt;/a&gt; and liquefies the surrounding flesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The chemical, which is also used to unclog drains, can burn a hole through the esophagus within a couple of hours. If it reaches the digestive tract, it can become lodged there, where it can start to burn through the intestinal wall, potentially leading to a hole, infection, and severe internal damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Four-year-old Lily, pictured in her hospital bed, swallowed the button battery inside a tracking device. She narrowly avoided a deadly chemical burn in her esophagus &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The small round trackers Marie purchased are popular devices used to track the location of electronics, but are commonly used now to track everything from luggage to pets and children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Disneyland is scary so I bought them to track my kids,’ Marie said. ‘The things that I thought would keep my kids safe are actually what caused harm.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A generally cautious parent, Marie has always been careful with batteries around her children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she had repeatedly warned them of the dangers of button batteries over the years, with the latest warning issued just two weeks prior to the incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She never believed her children would go into the glove box and take the small metal tags, let alone open them up and swallow their contents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The button battery that Lily swallowed did not stay in her esophagus, sparing her from a deadly chemical burn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the X-ray revealed that it had reached her bowel, still a dangerous position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors chose not to operate on the little girl to remove the battery, which would have involved a major invasive procedure with significant risks of its own, including infection and anesthesia complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The button battery that Lily swallowed is pictured. Her mother had stored the tracking devices in her car's glove compartment when she realized while on a trip to Disneyland that the devices did not work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The button battery reached Lily's digestive system. Typically, once inside the esophagus, moisture completes an electrical circuit between the battery’s terminals, triggering a reaction that produces a potent chemical that rapidly burns and dissolves surrounding tissue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, they sent the family home with laxatives to allow Lily to pass the battery naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was giving her laxatives and all kinds of things to try and get this thing out of her,’ Marie said. ‘I had her on trampolines, on a vibration plate, eating prunes, everything.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The anxiety took a toll on her family. Lily’s siblings asked if their sister was going to die, while Marie exhausted all options to help speed her digestion along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After four days, Lily passed the battery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marie said: ‘I wouldn't want that to happen to anybody else. It was very scary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If you have any toys that have button batteries in them, then throw them out, get rid of them.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2020, nearly two-year-old Johnathan Huff suddenly fell ill at daycare. He became lethargic and had a bloody nose. When he vomited, there was blood there too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors believed Johnathan was suffering from a viral illness that caused fever and vomiting. A few days after getting sick, Johnathan had a fatal seizure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lily was allowed to leave the hospital to pass the battery naturally. Her mother fed her laxatives to speed the process along, but it took four days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lily, second from right in front of her father, is pictured with her family. After the terrifying ordeal, her mother disposed of her toys that used the same type of batteries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A routine autopsy revealed that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-9184391/Toddler-bleeds-death-swallowing-button-battery-burned-organs-North-Carolina.html"&gt;a small button battery&lt;/a&gt; was lodged in Johnathan's intestines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The official cause of his death was a massive hemorrhage, caused by the battery's corrosive chemicals burning through his esophageal and aortic walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His mother, Jackie, said: 'It immediately felt like it was something we had done, we were desperately trying to figure out where this battery had come from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It wasn't a long search. We went to where we kept the remotes and discovered the key finder remote's back was off.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poison control gets around 3,000 calls a year about kids swallowing button batteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And researchers have tallied more than 70 deaths from ingesting them, recorded in a poison control database dating back to the 70s, though the actual number is likely far higher, as many cases are never documented in medical research or the media, and the official reporting hotline has been closed for six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 17:08:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>纽约市宣布哈莱姆军团病爆发结束--《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/30/new-york-city-harlem-legionnaires-disease-outbreak-over</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; has declared the deadly &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/05/new-york-city-legionnaires-disease-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;legionnaires’ disease outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in central Harlem over, nearly three weeks since it began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On Friday, city health officials &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2025/health-department-closes-investigation-central-harlem-legionnaires-cluster.page" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that there have been no new cases among residents who live or work in the area since 9 August.

Such water systems include shower heads, sink faucets, hot tubs, decorative fountains, large plumbing systems and cooling towers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Following an investigation, health officials were able to trace the bacteria back to cooling towers atop the city-run Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site overseen by the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most common way for someone to get sick is by breathing in mist containing legionella. Another way that the disease can be contracted is if someone accidentally swallows contaminated water and it enters their lungs, also known as aspiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most healthy people who are exposed to the bacteria do not get sick. Those who are more susceptible to contracting the disease include current or former smokers and people 50 years or older, as well as those with specific health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Symptoms usually develop two to 14 days after exposure to the bacteria and include cough, fever, headaches and muscle aches as well as shortness of breath. Other symptoms include confusion, diarrhea or nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Following the outbreak, all facilities with legionella-positive test results completed full cleaning and disinfection as directed by city officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Michelle Morse, New York City’s acting health commissioner, said: “As the city’s doctor, my thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted by the spread of legionella, and our hearts are with the families who lost a loved one … We are working with building owners on next steps to protect the health and safety of Harlem residents and to prevent future clusters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Following the outbreak, the Adams administration issued a slew of new proposals that include expanding the health department’s capacity to inspect the city’s cooling towers, requiring building owners to test for legionella at least every 30 days during the cooling tower operating period instead of the current 90-day requirement, expanding the health department’s sampling capacity to conduct proactive sampling of building cooling tower systems, and maintaining contracts to surge capacity when faced with novel issues during future clusters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 17:08:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNYy1wd01MYTdFVzFQeFNvOVhzbkFrb0sxZV9NOWVMdE1TaFJab1Q0c3ZBcnBST0F4bGY3NE04elVmUG54TEx6cXhHQzdWS0xIY3hZQ2MzR0pILXdzMVRMVTBZZXE2UE9pWHVzT3dhSzZJWkNRQWRrNFM2dENmQjRwdTdFNlB1THhHdjhuckl6Q3h6VHpGRFlwcGlQQzZBLS1wUlgwMEl3</guid></item><item><title>这个12分钟的早晨习惯在40分钟后在健身房锻炼超过45分钟的力量-吃这个不是那个</title><link>https://www.eatthis.com/12-minute-morning-strength-routine-after-40/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content single-post-content"&gt;
										
					
					
					&lt;p&gt;Once you hit 40, building and maintaining strength becomes more critical than ever. Muscle mass naturally declines with age (a process called &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560813/" target="_blank"&gt;sarcopenia&lt;/a&gt;), which can start as early as your 30s and accelerate with each passing decade. Having less muscle as you age can also negatively impact your &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7090295/" target="_blank"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6571089/" target="_blank"&gt;joint health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2024.1453527/full" target="_blank"&gt;balance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156816372100091X" target="_blank"&gt;your ability to perform daily tasks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is &lt;i&gt;ETNT &lt;/i&gt;has you covered. We chatted with Stephen Sheehan, CPT, a certified personal trainer at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://barbend.com/author/stephen-sheehan/" target="_blank"&gt;BarBend&lt;/a&gt;, who shares his go-to time-efficient morning routine for building strength without needing to go to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;“This sequence hits all the major muscle groups and builds functional strength quickly without any equipment,” Sheehan says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research in &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/fulltext/2021/06000/resistance_training_load_effects_on_muscle.12.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports &amp;amp; Exercise&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has shown that even brief bouts of resistance exercise can boost muscle function and support long-term health. While hitting the gym for a long strength session is great if you have the time, you don’t need to commit to 45-minute workouts to see results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following circuit involves five exercises, each performed for 45 seconds with a 15-second rest in between. Complete two full rounds for a total of 12 minutes. All you need is a clear space with grippy flooring and your body weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on for the workout and detailed instructions, then be sure to check out these &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/bodyweight-core-strength-after-45/" target="_blank"&gt;5 Bodyweight Moves That Build Core Strength Better Than Gym Classes After 45&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;12-Minute Morning Routine Builds Strength After 40&lt;/h2&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bodyweight Squats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/how-many-squats-to-see-results-after-40/" target="_blank"&gt;Squats&lt;/a&gt; are one of the most functional exercises you can do, as they &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10987311/" target="_blank"&gt;mimic common daily movements&lt;/a&gt; like sitting and standing, while training your lower body to work as a unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheehan tells us. “Squats activate your largest muscle groups like your glutes, quads, and hamstrings, which improve strength and circulation first thing in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and toes slightly pointed out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your chest lifted and core engaged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push your hips back and bend your knees to lower your body as if sitting into a chair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower until your thighs are parallel to the floor (or as low as comfortable. If you feel any pain, stop immediately!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive through your heels to return to a standing position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time &amp;amp; Rest:&lt;/b&gt; 45 seconds work, 15 seconds rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; Focus on control and form and avoid letting your knees collapse inward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-article__related-link"&gt;&lt;span class="c-article__related-link-inner"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a class="related-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/balance-tests-fall-risk-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;4 Tests That Reveal If You’re Headed for a Dangerous Fall After 50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Push-ups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASdvN_XEl_c?si=d9JCKbD37RI6fEQx" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love them or hate them, you can’t deny that &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/push-ups-elite-upper-body-strength-trainers/" target="_blank"&gt;push-ups&lt;/a&gt; are a staple for building upper-body strength. They engage your chest, triceps, shoulders, and core, making them one of the most efficient bodyweight exercises you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get into a high plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your body in a straight line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your elbows to lower your chest toward the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push through your palms to return to the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time &amp;amp; Rest:&lt;/b&gt; 45 seconds work, 15 seconds rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Modification:&lt;/b&gt; If a regular push-up is too difficult, drop to your knees while keeping your body in a straight line from head to knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-article__related-link"&gt;&lt;span class="c-article__related-link-inner"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a class="related-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/morning-exercises-women-over-45-daily/" target="_blank"&gt;7 Morning Exercises Women Should Do Every Day to Stay Young After 45&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Planks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pvIjsG5Svck?si=oImnyI-hZY2slkuj" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/plank-variations-for-six-pack/" target="_blank"&gt;plank&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8964357/" target="_blank"&gt;isometric exercise&lt;/a&gt; that strengthens not just the abs but the entire core, including the back, hips, and shoulders. “A plank locks in deep core strength and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8964357/" target="_blank"&gt;supports better posture and spine alignment&lt;/a&gt;,” Sheehan explains. “Focus on a straight line from head to heels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get into a forearm plank position with your elbows under your shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your body in a straight line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage your core, glutes, and legs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid letting your hips sag or pike upward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time &amp;amp; Rest:&lt;/b&gt; 45 seconds work, 15 seconds rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; Focus on breathing steadily by inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-article__related-link"&gt;&lt;span class="c-article__related-link-inner"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a class="related-link" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/standing-exercises-stop-muscle-loss-after-40/" target="_blank"&gt;6 Best Standing Exercises To Stop Muscle Loss After 40 in 30 Days&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Glute Bridges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OUgsJ8-Vi0E?si=qI1xYqISD0rdtff1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glute bridges are fantastic for strengthening your &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7039033/" target="_blank"&gt;posterior chain&lt;/a&gt; (backside), including your glutes, hamstrings, and lower back, which often gets neglected in favor of front-of-body training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Squeeze at the top to get the most muscle activation and lower with control,” Sheehan advises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat, hip-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your heels to lift your hips toward the ceiling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squeeze your glutes at the top and hold for one to two seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower your hips back down with control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time &amp;amp; Rest:&lt;/b&gt; 45 seconds work, 15 seconds rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; Keep your core engaged to avoid overextending your lower back.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alternating Lunges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tTej-ax9XiA?si=ynJy9TEfaNmEXnh4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes lunges so effective is that you are forced to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6063068/" target="_blank"&gt;engage each leg individually&lt;/a&gt;, which can help &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6006536/" target="_blank"&gt;correct imbalances&lt;/a&gt; and build strength in the quads, glutes, and hamstrings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lunges improve balance, coordination, and lower-body strength,” Sheehan says. “Keep your front knee over your ankle and drive through your heel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand with your feet hip-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step forward with your right leg and lower until both knees are bent at about 90 degrees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push through your right heel to return to the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat on the left leg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time &amp;amp; Rest:&lt;/b&gt; 45 seconds work, 15 seconds rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; Keep your torso upright and avoid leaning forward.&lt;/p&gt;

The diet tweaks that helped you lose a pound or two in a pinch or the workout that turbocharged your energy just don't deliver in the same way. While frustrating, this isn't unusual. After 40, metabolism starts to slow, muscle mass begins to decline, and hormone levels start to shift, all changes that need to be accounted for in your habits. The first step you can take: Incorporating more foods for women over 40 into your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the expert: &lt;a href="https://kitchencoachrd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sarah Mirkin, R.D.N., C.P.T., L.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sarah Mirkin, R.D.N., C.P.T., L.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and founder of Kitchen Coach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to following a regular exercise routine, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/a30981827/how-to-sleep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:getting enough sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;getting enough sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and reducing your stress levels, eating foods that are rich in antioxidants, protein, and healthy fats can help you curb hunger and cravings while counteracting these changes&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what foods should go on your plate? &lt;a href="https://kitchencoachrd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sarah Mirkin, R.D.N., C.P.T., L.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sarah Mirkin, R.D.N., C.P.T., L.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and founder of Kitchen Coach, shared her favorite nutritional all-stars that can help increase your fat-burning capabilities, stabilize your energy, and minimize your disease risk. From dark chocolate to salmon to vibrant berries, these foods for women over 40 are full of flavor &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; age-reversing nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best foods for women over 40&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Flaxseeds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flaxseeds are an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential fats for a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g32905337/brain-healthy-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sharp mind;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sharp mind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20502183/best-foods-for-heart-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy heart;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy heart&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, they’re great for your gut. “As we age, it’s more important to eat the right foods to keep your gut health in check,” said Mirkin. “Flaxseeds are loaded with fiber for long-term digestive health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just be sure to use ground flaxseeds or grind whole ones; your body digests and absorbs the nutrients from ground flaxseeds better than whole ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Toss some over yogurt or oatmeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Wild salmon&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish, like salmon, are rich in omega-3s and a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g23065278/high-protein-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:good source of lean protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;good source of lean protein&lt;/a&gt;. And while fat has more than double the calories of protein and carbohydrates, it is key to keeping your cravings in check. “Salmon is not only satisfying and delicious, but it will also make your skin glow, reduce your risk of disease, and even curb your hunger,” Mirkin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/recipes/a26986386/salmon-avocado-tomato-salad-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Salmon Salad with Avocado and Sweet Grape Tomatoes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Salmon Salad with Avocado and Sweet Grape Tomatoes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Avocados&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packed with healthy fats, avocados can help keep your skin plump, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g29538761/best-food-for-hair-growth/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nourish your hair;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nourish your hair&lt;/a&gt;, and help &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/g26576559/foods-for-high-blood-pressure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lower blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to their decent &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a63237886/foods-high-in-potassium/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:potassium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt; content. “Although avocados are very high in fat, they are linked with weight loss because they are so satisfying,” said Mirkin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Nuts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuts make a filling &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/g19576831/healthy-snack-ideas-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:snack that promotes weight loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;snack that promotes weight loss&lt;/a&gt; because they’re high in fiber, healthy fats, and protein. Bonus: The nutrients in nuts help reduce your risk of chronic conditions, like &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a21764231/type-2-diabetes-definition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and heart disease, said Mirkin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; These &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/recipes/a22998801/cherry-chocolate-granola-bars-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cherry chocolate granola bars;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cherry chocolate granola bars&lt;/a&gt; pack a double dose of nuts with almond butter and chopped almonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Watercress&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shake up your go-to salad with this peppery leafy green while keeping your skin glowing in the process. “It’s packed with water, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g20511745/9-foods-with-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin C;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g21288692/vitamin-a-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin A;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;, and antioxidants that kill free radicals,” Mirkin said, one of the main aggressors of premature skin damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Replace some of the lettuce in your favorite salad with watercress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Sauerkraut&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made from fermented cabbage, this tangy condiment is packed with gut-boosting probiotics—a.k.a. good bacteria—making it a nutritional must-have for women over 40. Research shows that these that healthy bugs may improve your &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9818925/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:immune function;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;immune function&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/probiotics-may-help-boost-mood-and-cognitive-function" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mood;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mood&lt;/a&gt;, and even your &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10385652/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:skin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt;. Not a fan of sauerkraut? Kimchi, the spicy Korean version, will deliver the same perks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Add a spoonful to a burger or sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Dark chocolate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chocolate may not be the first thing you think of when it comes to better nutrition after 40, but this after-dinner indulgence can actually do wonders for your health. “Dark chocolate is rich in flavonols, which protect your heart, reduce the risk of diabetes, and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/g26576559/foods-for-high-blood-pressure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lower blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, ” Mirkin said. Stick to chocolate bars that contain at least 70% cocoa and less than 6 grams of added sugar to get the most nutritional bang out of every serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g25728973/healthy-chocolate-bars-snacks/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:13 Healthy Dark Chocolate Bars That Aren’t Sugar Bombs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;13 Healthy Dark Chocolate Bars That Aren’t Sugar Bombs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Dark leafy greens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dark leafy greens, such as spinach, kale, and mustard greens, contain high amounts of vitamin K, lutein, folate, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a64624906/best-calcium-rich-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:calcium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt;, and beta carotene, which can preserve memory functioning,” said Mirkin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Add a handful of greens to a smoothie for a nutrition boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9. Berries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berries will naturally brighten your dish and supply hunger-curbing fiber to satisfy sweet cravings. Their gem-like hues are a great indicator of their nutrient concentration. “Dark pigmentation and rich color means the berries are high in disease-fighting antioxidants and phytochemicals,” Mirkin explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Sprinkle over yogurt or snack on by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10. Garlic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garlic is a serious wellness wonder, especially for women over 40. “Studies suggest that garlic can minimize bone loss by increasing estrogen levels. It is also nutrient-rich with very few calories and adds flavor to foods so you’re satisfied with less,” Mirkin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Use it to flavor roasted vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11. Edamame&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edamame packs 9 grams of muscle-building &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a20514733/high-protein-vegetables-and-plant-based-food/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plant protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;plant protein&lt;/a&gt; in just ½ cup for less than 100 calories. These versatile soybeans are also a great source of folate (vitamin B9), &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g20465791/8-foods-that-have-more-iron-than-beef/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:iron;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, vitamins C and A, and potassium for your heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Roast some with flaky sea salt or perk up your favorite pasta dish with a handful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;12. Greek yogurt&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/g31350918/bone-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keep your bones strong;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Keep your bones strong&lt;/a&gt; with a serving of rich and creamy Greek yogurt every day. “It’s an excellent source of calcium and contains almost no sodium,” Mirkin said. Greek yogurt packs more protein and has a thicker consistency than other yogurts, so it’s the perfect snack for keeping you full and energized. Plus, it has active cultures that support gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Enjoy a bowl of Greek yogurt for breakfast with honey, granola, and berries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;13. Extra virgin olive oil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there anything more delicious than EVOO drizzled over warm, crusty bread? A staple of the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/diets/a30326160/mediterranean-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, olive oil is rich in unsaturated fats that have anti-aging and anti-inflammatory properties to &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/olive-oil-can-it-lower-your-risk-of-dying-early-202203012695" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:promote longevity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;promote longevity&lt;/a&gt; and optimal heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Use a healthy dose of olive oil in your homemade salad dressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;14. Eggs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any way you scramble it, eggs are a nutritional multitasker. They contain vitamin D for bone health, choline for brain function, and protein for preserving muscle. Mirkin suggested scrambling one egg with three egg whites for a slimming and filling breakfast. “The high fat and protein content (plus lack of carbohydrates and sugars) in eggs makes them an excellent choice for women over 40,” said Mirkin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Need meal prep ideas? Try some make-ahead egg muffins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;15. Chia seeds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds may be tiny, but they’re mighty with filling fiber, omega 3 fatty acids, magnesium for healthy bones, and complete plant-based protein. Because they absorb water so well, downing chia is also thought to help &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11406937/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:boost your satiety;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;boost your satiety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Make a chia seed pudding or add some to a smoothie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;16. Onions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their translucent appearance, onions are dense in vital nutrients. “They are high in the protective antioxidant &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g20511745/9-foods-with-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin C;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;, B vitamins for a healthy metabolism, and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a63237886/foods-high-in-potassium/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:potassium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt; for stable blood pressure levels,” Mirkin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Prep some caramelized onions in advance to add to sandwiches, stir-fries, salads, and soups for a burst of flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;17. Carrots&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrots are packed with beta carotene (the pigment responsible for their vibrant hue), which is converted into vitamin A—a superstar nutrient that &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a31286522/how-to-boost-immune-system/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:supports immunity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;supports immunity&lt;/a&gt; and boosts eye health. “In your 40s, it’s more important than ever to eat more &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g21288692/vitamin-a-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin A-rich foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin A-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, because they also protect your eyes from cataracts,” said Mirkin. Carrots are also high in potassium to stabilize blood pressure, fiber for better digestion, and vitamin K for bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Snack on them raw with some hummus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;18. Broccoli&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broccoli is chock-full of antioxidants, phytonutrients, and vitamins C, B6, and A—all of which Mirkin said can help stave off chronic conditions like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and Alzheimer’s as you age. Plus, you’ll get tons of healthy fiber for better digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Roast with garlic and olive oil for a powerhouse side dish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;19. Chicken&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason chicken has become a weight loss staple: It packs roughly 25 grams of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g23065278/high-protein-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; in just 4 ounces (or about the size of your palm). It’s also fairly low in fat and calories, making it a leaner choice than most red meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Marinate and grill for a tasty supper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;20. Bell peppers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, all bell peppers contain more vitamin C than an orange, an antioxidant that’s thought to boost immunity and promote collagen production. Any color will do, but red is the sweetest if you prefer your crunchy snack to be less bitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Add raw to a salad or saute to put in tacos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;21. Beans&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ndsu.edu/agriculture/extension/publications/all-about-beans-nutrition-health-benefits-preparation-and-use-menus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Beans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Beans&lt;/a&gt; are loaded with fiber to keep your blood sugar stable, along with folate and iron. Get even more out of this vegetarian protein source by choosing darker varieties (like kidney or black beans), which have higher concentrations of antioxidants and phytonutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Make healthy black bean burgers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;22. Quinoa&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quinoa is a complete plant protein—and serves up a whopping &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content?contenttypeid=76&amp;amp;contentid=20035-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:8 grams per 1-cup;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;8 grams per 1-cup&lt;/a&gt; serving! The fluffy grain also offers tons of gut-healthy fiber to keep you feeling satisfied. Bonus: It cooks up faster than brown rice and barley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Use as a base for a veggie-packed grain bowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;23. Basil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basil is loaded with polyphenols, which are beneficial in soothing chronic pain associated with arthritis, and even help protect your liver, brain, and heart, according to Mirkin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Perk up your salad or pasta dish with a sprinkle of minced basil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;24. Ginger root&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just one teaspoon of ginger per week can improve your artery function, said Mirkin. &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/ginger-benefits" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Studies also show;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Studies also show&lt;/a&gt; the fragrant root (often when taken in supplement form) may also help prevent diabetes, ease menstrual and muscle pain, and possibly even ward off obesity. If you’re prone to tummy troubles, it’s also a great natural remedy for nausea and other digestive issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Traditional-Medicinals-Organic-Ginger-Herbal/dp/B0009F3S7I/?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.65935574%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Traditional Medicinals Organic Ginger Herbal Tea;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Traditional Medicinals Organic Ginger Herbal Tea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;25. Sweet potatoes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These bright orange tubers fall under the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g25335049/healthy-carbs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy carb category;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy carb category&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because sweet potatoes pack tons of gut-filling fiber, magnesium, heart-healthy potassium, vitamin C, and vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Eat them roasted, baked, or boiled in salads, as fries, or in soups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;26. Tomatoes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomatoes are nutritional superstars. Red tomatoes, in particular, are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11179732/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rich in lycopene;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;rich in lycopene&lt;/a&gt;, a carotenoid that may help reduce your risk of chronic diseases. The tangy fruits are also low in calories but high in potassium, zinc, and vitamin C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Juicy tomatoes are amazing in salsas, sauces, salads, and sandwiches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;27. Mushrooms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good-for-you nutrients in mushrooms, including vitamin D, B vitamins, potassium, selenium, and the powerful antioxidants ergothioneine and glutathione, have been shown to improve heart health, brain health, gut health, and immune function, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/blog/five-health-benefits-of-mushrooms.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cedars-Sinai;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cedars-Sinai&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Toss into a stir-fry or savory soup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;28. Oregano&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This powerful green herb is “rich in antioxidants that fight free radical damage,” said Mirkin, potentially helping to stave off disease-causing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Sprinkle this subtly sweet Italian staple on everything from salads to pastas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;29. Citrus fruits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oranges, grapefruits, lemons, limes, and the like boast tons of antioxidants, fiber, vitamin C, and other nutrients that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10451236/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research shows can;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research shows can&lt;/a&gt; boost your brain health, aid weight loss, protect your heart, and keep your skin looking radiant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;Squeeze over cooked protein for a tangy boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;30. Nutritional yeast&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vegan staple packs a powerful combination of nutrients. “Just 1/4 cup of nutritional yeast offers a whopping 8 grams of protein to keep you satisfied with minimal calories,” said Mirkin. It’s also a great source of B vitamins—something that many vegetarians tend to be deficient in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try it: &lt;/strong&gt;With a cheesy, nutty flavor, nutritional yeast makes a great dairy-free substitute for cheese in pasta, pizza, and salads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you age, your &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/a20478794/boost-metabolism-with-the-high-metabolism-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:metabolism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt; slows down, you begin to lose muscle mass, and your hormone levels go a bit wonky, making you more prone to weight gain, mood changes, and health problems you may not have dealt with during your younger years. Fortunately, there are things you can do to increase your fat-burning capabilities, stabilize your energy, and minimize your disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to following a regular exercise routine, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/a30981827/how-to-sleep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:getting enough sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;getting enough sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/mental-health/g26542035/how-to-relieve-stress/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reducing your stress levels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reducing your stress levels&lt;/a&gt;, eating antioxidant-rich foods can help you curb hunger and cravings while improving your overall health&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;So what foods should go on your plate?

The study analyzed both dietary habits and brain autopsy results, offering evidence that nutrition may help protect memory-related brain regions during aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIND diet stands for Mediterranean–DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay. It combines elements of the Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, fish, and olive oil, with the DASH diet, which is designed to reduce high blood pressure through reduced sodium intake and balanced nutrients. The MIND diet specifically highlights foods thought to benefit brain function, such as leafy greens, berries, nuts, whole grains, beans, poultry, and fish. It also limits foods high in saturated fat and sugar, including red meat, full-fat cheese, pastries, and fried or fast foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have linked the MIND diet to slower cognitive decline, reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease, and greater brain volume. However, its potential relationship with specific brain pathologies had not been fully explored. The new study aimed to address that gap by focusing on hippocampal sclerosis—a degenerative condition that affects the hippocampus, a brain structure involved in memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have limited treatments for dementia, and the growing aging population faces an increased risk of this condition, which affects quality of life in many ways. Previously, we have shown that the MIND diet is associated with slower cognitive decline, reduced dementia risk, less brain pathology, and greater cognitive resilience. Thus, this study was to further understand the other potential underlying mechanisms beyond Alzheimer’s pathology that can explain link between diet and cognition,” said study author Puja Agarwal, an assistant professor at Rush University Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hippocampal health is important for older adults, particularly for memory. Hippocampal sclerosis is an important pathologic marker for hippocampal health, characterized by gliosis and neuronal loss and related to cognitive impairment and dementia beyond Alzheimer’s pathology. However, there are limited human studies on diet and hippocampal health. This study specifically looked at the MIND diet to examine its association with hippocampal sclerosis and whether that association helps explain the link between diet and cognition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed data from the Memory and Aging Project, a long-running study conducted by Rush University in Chicago. Participants were older adults who did not have dementia at enrollment and who agreed to donate their brains for research after death. Over the course of several years, participants completed annual evaluations, including cognitive tests, physical exams, and dietary assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the dietary component, participants filled out detailed food frequency questionnaires that asked about their usual intake of a wide range of foods. The researchers used these data to calculate MIND diet scores for each person, with higher scores indicating closer adherence to the diet. These scores were based on 15 components: ten considered healthy for the brain and five considered less healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of death, researchers conducted brain autopsies following standardized procedures. They examined the hippocampus for signs of sclerosis, measured the extent of neuronal loss, and assessed whether there was evidence of LATE pathology. The team also recorded other relevant factors, including whether the person had Alzheimer’s pathology, vascular disease, or a genetic risk factor (the APOE-ε4 allele).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of 809 participants, about 10 percent showed signs of hippocampal sclerosis. Those with higher MIND diet scores were less likely to have this condition, even after adjusting for age, sex, education, calorie intake, Alzheimer’s disease markers, and vascular conditions. Each additional point on the MIND diet scale was associated with a 22 percent reduction in the odds of having hippocampal sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results were encouraging on how a modifiable risk factor such as diet may impact one’s hippocampal health via reducing the likelihood of hippocampal sclerosis,” Agarwal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at cases where hippocampal sclerosis appeared alongside LATE pathology. Again, people who adhered more closely to the MIND diet had lower odds of having both conditions. However, the diet did not appear to have a significant association with LATE pathology by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a subset of 300 participants, the team analyzed the degree of neuronal loss in the hippocampus. Those in the highest MIND diet group had fewer signs of severe neuronal loss. Even after accounting for potential confounding factors, such as Alzheimer’s disease and vascular issues, this association remained significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key finding came from a mediation analysis. The researchers wanted to understand whether the link between the MIND diet and reduced dementia risk might be explained by its effect on hippocampal sclerosis. Their analysis indicated that about 21 percent of the diet’s protective effect against dementia could be attributed to its association with lower rates of hippocampal sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings support the existing literature on MIND diet and brain health outcomes including cognitive decline and dementia and extends our understanding on how diet may play a role via supporting hippocampal health by its association with less hippocampal sclerosis and more neurons in the hippocampus,” Agarwal told PsyPost. “To our knowledge these are the first findings in human studies to report that the association of diet and dementia is partially mediated by hippocampal sclerosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers ran additional tests to check the strength of their results. They excluded participants who had moderate to severe cognitive impairment early on, as well as those whose dietary data were collected close to death. Even after these adjustments, the association between the MIND diet and hippocampal health remained consistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given dementia is a known concern for aging population, these findings are encouraging and can have major public health implications such as to promote a good healthy diet for brain health,” Agarwal said. “It also implies that talking about a healthy diet such as MIND diet should be prioritized in the clinical settings by trained individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study presents strong evidence of a link between the MIND diet and markers of brain health, it also has some limitations. Because it is an observational study, it cannot confirm a cause-and-effect relationship. It is possible that other unmeasured factors—such as access to healthcare, broader lifestyle habits, or genetic differences—could have influenced both diet and brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants in the study were primarily older White adults who agreed to donate their brains for research, which may limit how broadly the findings can be applied. The researchers noted that more work is needed to see whether these associations hold in more diverse populations or in younger age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area for future research involves identifying the specific nutrients or foods that may be most beneficial. While the MIND diet includes a variety of recommended foods, it is not yet clear which components contribute most strongly to the observed effects. Ongoing research is also examining how diet interacts with biological markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The role of modifiable lifestyle factors, including diet, is gaining momentum as a preventive strategy for dementia worldwide,” Agarwal said. “Thus, studies like ours are important and open doors for more research in this space. To further extend our findings, we are now looking into specific foods, nutrients, and biomarkers indicating neuroinflammation and oxidative stress—the two known hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease–related dementias (AD/ADRD)—using upcoming platforms so that we can develop precise dietary recommendations and generate more clinical implications for at-risk populations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2837334" target="_blank"&gt;MIND Diet and Hippocampal Sclerosis Among Community-Based Older Adults&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Puja Agarwal, Sonal Agrawal, Maude Wagner, Laurel J.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research from the University of Aberdeen challenges the current view that trauma in childhood increases the risk of all health conditions. The study found instead that some conditions are more affected than others and women are more affected than men.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;A team of scientists from the University of Aberdeen analyzed data from over 16,000 people born in the UK in 1958 and followed them into adult life to understand how difficult childhood experiences can affect health at 50 years old. They looked at 14 types of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adverse+childhood+experiences/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;adverse childhood experiences&lt;/a&gt; (ACEs), including abuse, neglect, family conflict, bullying, financial hardship, and family illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) refer to potentially traumatic events or circumstances during childhood. As well as affecting childhood well-being, ACEs have been associated with long-term adverse health and social outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most studies report associations between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and a single health outcome. This is the first study to look at a broad range of health outcomes and offers insight into more targeted interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found, for the first time, that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mental+health+problems/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mental health problems&lt;/a&gt; and severe pain showed the strongest connections to childhood trauma. Adults who experienced &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/childhood+adversity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;childhood adversity&lt;/a&gt; were significantly more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, and chronic pain at 50 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also found that the more trauma experienced, the greater the impact on health at 50. Specifically, people who experienced four or more types of childhood adversity had the highest risk of developing health problems as adults.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;In both sexes, severe pain and poor mental health displayed the largest associations, while in women, gastrointestinal problems and asthma and bronchitis were also associated with childhood trauma, as measured by ACE scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full paper is &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2838109" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; today in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team used data from the National Child Development Study, also known as the 1958 Birth Cohort Study, which follows approximately 17,000 people born during one week in 1958 in England, Scotland, and Wales. Once they reached 50 years old, they were interviewed about their current health, using a comprehensive list of 16 conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team investigated health outcomes which have not typically been examined by previous studies, such as pain, which is among the leading causes worldwide of years of disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Gary Macfarlane, Chair in Epidemiology at the University of Aberdeen, who led the study, explains their findings, "Our study provides evidence of the multifaceted potential health consequences of ACEs but shows the greatest excess risks in relation to mental ill-health and severe pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This emphasizes the role of childhood adversity as a key driver of health inequalities, and a public health priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings highlight the importance of considering prevention strategies to mitigate the potential long-term health consequences of ACEs.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"Going forward, screening for ACEs in primary care settings, and targeted interventions for at-risk individuals, may help reduce the burden of chronic pain, mental ill-health, and other poor health outcomes. There may also be a need for tailored approaches accounting for sex differences in ACE-related vulnerabilities, while specific ACEs were shown to have the most wide-ranging associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While 'broad spectrum' interventions remain important to ameliorate the impact of ACEs, a targeted approach, considering types of ACE, could address specific vulnerabilities—particularly mental ill-health and severe pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The findings also highlight the importance of preventing childhood trauma and providing early support to at-risk families."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deborah Alsina MBE, Chief Executive of Versus Arthritis, added, "This important research highlights the strong relationship between early childhood adversity and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/severe+pain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;severe pain&lt;/a&gt; in adulthood. Findings suggest that our earliest experiences may be driving the health inequalities we know exist for people living with chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We must confront inequalities in musculoskeletal health. That requires bold investment in local, personalized, evidence-based care and addressing the wider social and economic factors that shape health. That is why we are proud to have invested in this research as part of the Advanced Pain Discovery Platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Tackling childhood adversity is vital if our governments are serious about reducing the burden of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+pain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic pain&lt;/a&gt; for the next generation."&lt;/p&gt;

It's also what you &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; to do. We pick up habits because they make us feel happy, productive, or socially accepted, but they can also sometimes work against us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may not realize it, but certain habits can actually slow your thinking and cloud your judgment. The smartest people recognize this and know how to unlearn pesky habits that hold them back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here are 8 things smart people stop doing once they realize they're making themselves less intelligent:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Eating a lot of sugar&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-08/sugar-consumption-things-smart-people-stop-doing-realize-making-themselves-less-intelligent.png" alt="eating sugar things smart people stop doing realize making themselves less intelligent" title="eating sugar things smart people stop doing realize making themselves less intelligent" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;PeopleImages.com Yuri A | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we consume sugar, our blood glucose level rises. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, because glucose is an essential fuel for our brains. It actually utilizes one-half of the energy produced from the sugar that we store in our bodies. However, the problem starts when we introduce &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt; glucose into the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10780393/#sec5-nutrients-16-00075" rel="nofollow"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have linked chronically high blood sugar to cognitive impairment. Excess glucose in the blood decreases the production of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is a crucial chemical for the brain to process new memories and recall information. As a result, a high-sugar diet restricts the brain’s capability to learn and form memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/odd-traits-highly-intelligent-people-others-find-slightly-unsettling"&gt;11 Odd Traits Of Highly Intelligent People That Others Find Slightly Unsettling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Having too much screen time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern technology and the pandemic have made screen time unavoidable over the past couple of years. Though some people prefer working remotely, it can have some negative effects on our social and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Face-to-face meetings are really valuable for our mental health. People are spending way more time on screens than ever, and missing out on the valuable cognitive activity that happens when interacting in person. A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-34957-4#Sec2" rel="nofollow"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; led by Austrian scientists examined how mental health was affected by the conditions of the pandemic. They found that "people who generally spent more time on face-to-face and digital text communication during the lockdown had better mental health than people who generally spent less time on face-to-face and digital text communication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at screens all day long can significantly interrupt your quality of sleep, and it has even been proven to increase depression and anxiety. To avoid damaging your brain in the long run, set a clear limit for your screen time. &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/wecan/reduce-screen-time/index.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;Health experts&lt;/a&gt; suggest that, outside of work, screen time for adults shouldn't exceed two hours per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Not getting enough sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-08/sleep-deprivation-things-smart-people-stop-doing-realize-making-themselves-less-intelligent.png" alt="not sleeping things smart people stop doing realize making themselves less intelligent" title="not sleeping things smart people stop doing realize making themselves less intelligent" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;New Africa | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know that our central nervous system is our body’s main information highway. Sleep is vital for your body to function perfectly, but severe insomnia can cause disruptions in how your body transmits and processes information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pathways are established between nerve cells (neurons) in your brain during sleep that help you recall new knowledge. Sleep deprivation drains your brain, making it unable to perform its functions effectively. &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/sleep/art-20048379" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; has some great tips on how to sleep better at night, including having a consistent sleeping schedule, getting physical activity every day, and creating an optimal environment for resting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, sleep deprivation can make you more susceptible to micro-sleep, which is when people fall asleep for a short period of up to 30 seconds. Out-of-control microsleep can be fatal, especially when you are in the driver's seat. &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-you-should-know-about-microsleep" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sleep expert Dr. Samuel Gurevich&lt;/a&gt; said, "It’s important to recognize it’s happening and the situations that cause it and to take it seriously.

Overeating&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overeating and eating unhealthy foods are believed to be bad habits that lead to long-term consequences for the brain. &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/mireille-serlie/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Mireille Serlie&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of medicine, found in her &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00816-9" rel="nofollow"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; that people who are obese have an impaired brain response that struggles to detect nutrients in the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She explained, "In neuroimaging studies in humans, we found differences in brain areas involved in food intake between people with a healthy weight and those with obesity. We don’t know exactly when these changes in the brain occur and when they become more permanent. But we do know that specific eating patterns and diet compositions are associated with weight gain, suggesting specific nutrients play a role."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overeating has a physical impact on your body and puts you at risk for major health problems, including obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure, all of which are known to also be linked to brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Multitasking&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-08/multitasking-things-smart-people-stop-doing-realize-making-themselves-less-intelligent.png" alt="multitasking things smart people stop doing realize making themselves less intelligent" title="multitasking things smart people stop doing realize making themselves less intelligent" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Inside Creative House | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who multitask are persistently distracted, and they aren’t nearly as focused as those who use their brains to work on one task at a time. Multitaskers have a harder time filtering out extraneous information since they are using all parts of the brain at once, and they often take longer to complete tasks than those who just work on one task at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0106698#s3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that multitaskers have reduced density in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which plays a key role in attention, decision-making, error detection, and emotion regulation. Other &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0903620106" rel="nofollow"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have also found that "heavy multitaskers were slower in detecting changes in visual patterns, more susceptible to false recollections of the distractors during a memory task, and were slower in task switching." If you want to work most efficiently and effectively, science says that multitasking isn't the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Subjecting themselves to loud noises&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your ears are delicate organs, and the noises you hear daily, like traffic and construction, not only affect your hearing but also your cognitive function. A &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/alz.12191" rel="nofollow"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of over 5,000 Chicago residents revealed that, for every 10 decibel (dB) increase in residential noise level, there was a 36% increase in the risk of mild cognitive impairment and a 29% increase in the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. If you live in a big city, you may want to invest in some ear protection for the sake of your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ear infections can also create difficulties for hearing and neurological complications in the long run. &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11910-018-0817-7" rel="nofollow"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that hearing loss, facial paralysis, meningitis, and brain abscesses can be unfortunate side effects of ear infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Not getting daily movement&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-08/daily-movement-things-smart-people-stop-doing-realize-making-themselves-less-intelligent.png" alt="not moving things smart people stop doing realize making themselves less intelligent" title="not moving things smart people stop doing realize making themselves less intelligent" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Drazen Zigic | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we struggle with finding the motivation to go to the gym or stick to our health goals. However, we might be a little more motivated knowing that exercise is crucial to maintaining brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank Booth and Nathan Kerr, researchers at the University of Missouri, discovered in a &lt;a href="https://showme.missouri.edu/2025/inactive-today-forgetful-tomorrow-mizzou-researchers-discover-a-link-between-lack-of-physical-activity-and-a-decline-in-brain-health/" rel="nofollow"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; that only 10 days of being physically inactive can lead to insulin resistance and an increase in reactive oxygen species production in the hippocampus, which is a brain region involved in memory and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle disuse has also been associated with Alzheimer's disease. Booth said, "Research in Alzheimer’s development is starting to show that a lot of the neurological changes for Alzheimer’s disease are occurring when people are in their 40s and 50s, even if the official diagnosis of Alzheimer’s often comes at or after age 65. So, if you can develop good habits in terms of exercise and lifestyle earlier in your life, your brain will thank you later on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Consuming constant information&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's called "information overload," and our brains simply can't keep up. The rising popularity of short-form content and a decrease in attention spans cause us to take in an absurd amount of information constantly. The brain only has so much capacity for processing data, and it can easily become fatigued. When your brain is overtired, you won't be able to think clearly or make decisions properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This often occurs when multitasking, which leads to the release of cortisol (a stress hormone) and adrenaline, which both contribute to triggering the "fight or flight" response in the body. Continuously shifting focus can affect how well you can recall or retain important information and decrease your ability to sift through unnecessary information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/dont-think-youre-smart-might-have-these-rare-forms-of-intelligence"&gt;If You Don't Think You're Smart, You Might Just Have These 9 Exceptionally Rare Forms Of Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sufyan Maan is a freelance writer who writes about personal growth and how to invest in yourself.

In the early stages, germ cells — which develop into egg cells — divide and connect to one another in complex chains called nests. When these nests burst open, individual egg cells are released and are encased by a layer of specialized cells called pregranulosa cells, which support the young eggs and signal when it's time to mature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These eggs encircled by pregranulosa cells are called primordial follicles, and are what make up the ovarian reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-3SPYAyYe2AU9Bn6kqFbbqL" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-3SPYAyYe2AU9Bn6kqFbbqL slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primordial follicles start to form around 20 weeks after fertilization, and cluster on the inside edges of the ovaries. When the follicles closest to the center of the ovary in these clusters mature, they grow and produce sex hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it is the primordial follicles that ensure the ovaries perform their jobs of producing mature eggs and releasing hormones, Clark said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple ovarian diseases and conditions are rooted in problems with the cells in the ovarian reserve. For example, although the exact cause of PCOS is still unknown, it involves &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1097/OGX.0b013e31815e85fc" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1097/OGX.0b013e31815e85fc" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dysfunction in the primordial follicles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And yet, very little work has been done to understand their development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building a map of how and when the ovarian reserve forms during pregnancy can help figure out why certain diseases and issues with fertility crop up later in life. "That's where this study came in," Clark said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="941672bb-628f-4cc8-86e7-f6145a342f4e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth/1st-atlas-of-human-ovaries-could-lead-to-fertility-breakthrough-scientists-say" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth/1st-atlas-of-human-ovaries-could-lead-to-fertility-breakthrough-scientists-say"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1st 'atlas' of human ovaries could lead to fertility breakthrough, scientists say&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-7601c55f-d96c-4c10-9dce-d2f1851a908e" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="surprise-findings-3"&gt;Surprise findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="c60eba38-154d-4c57-8e70-b90b5fc548f7"&gt;To investigate how ovarian reserves originate in primates, Clark and her team looked at a monkey species that is physiologically similar to humans. This makes it a good stand-in for what happens developmentally in humans, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, female monkey &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/44899-stages-of-pregnancy.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/44899-stages-of-pregnancy.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;embryos and fetuses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were harvested at various developmental stages and ovarian tissue samples were taken. The researchers focused on several key time points: day 34 (when the sex organs become either male or female), 41 (early ovarian growth), 50-52 (end of embryonic period), 100 (when the egg nest expands) and 130 (when the nest bursts and the primordial follicles form) after fertilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the team analyzed the position and molecular fingerprint of the ovarian cells to understand the critical events in the formation of the ovarian reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that pregranulosa cells formed in two waves, but it was only during the second wave, between days 41 and 52, that pregranulosa cells formed that would go on to swarm the young eggs to form primordial follicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also identified two genes that seem to be active prior to this second wave. The researchers said that looking further into the function of these genes may help to pinpoint the developmental origins of ovarian reserve problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="9557a68b-7649-419a-b5ff-8d4ea5be6f84"&gt;Also, Clark said the team was completely surprised to find that "before birth, the ovary goes through practice rounds of folliculogenesis," meaning that very soon after the ovarian reserve is made, some of the more centrally located follicles mature and can produce hormones. The researchers suggest that determining why these follicles normally activate could provide insight into the causes of PCOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the researchers are looking at a highly dynamic period in development, when the cellular makeup of an embryo can change dramatically, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/garcia-alonso-luz/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/garcia-alonso-luz/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Luz Garcia-Alonso&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a computational biologist at the Wellcome Sanger Institute who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. And they have big time gaps between their observation periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This stage when cell lineages are specified is very dynamic, and cell composition changes within days," Garcia-Alonso said. So the team should collect more fine-scale data on more time points to get a better picture of what is going on, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-3SPYAyYe2AU9Bn6kqFbbqL-Slai49gUpTAHCDRyaFNbxH0PARPCXOcB" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-3SPYAyYe2AU9Bn6kqFbbqL-Slai49gUpTAHCDRyaFNbxH0PARPCXOcB slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

While certain risk factors are outside of your control, like aging and family history, there are many lifestyle behaviors that can help minimize the risks. For starters, diets rich in plants—such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds—are associated with a reduced risk of developing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fruit makes the list, but it sometimes gets a bad rap for being too high in sugar. But the sugar found in fruit is natural, not added sugar. And fruit is low in calories and nutrient-dense. “Fruit contains different types of nutrients, phytochemicals (natural compounds that give them their unique colors), fiber and antioxidants that can assist in the prevention of cancer in a variety of ways,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryat8801/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ryan Yates, RD, LDN, ACSM-ACS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ryan Yates, RD, LDN, ACSM-ACS&lt;/a&gt;, a cancer exercise specialist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts agree that there’s no need to avoid fruit—doing so means missing out on key nutrients that may help lower the risk of cancer. Including a variety of colorful fruits also means increased nutrient diversity. Here are six fruits to explore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Blueberries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Blueberries have anthocyanins that help prevent DNA damage and may slow cancer development,” says &lt;a href="https://www.getcare.elcaminohealth.org/providers/arun-raajasekar-md-1801143722-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Arun Raajasekar, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Arun Raajasekar, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a medical oncologist. The same anthocyanins “are strongly associated with lower levels of inflammation markers in the body,” adds Yates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blueberries are also rich in fiber, providing 3.5 grams per cup. “A high-fiber diet is especially important, not only for healthy digestion, regularity and microbiome balance, but also for its potential role in lowering colorectal cancer risk through gut microbiome modulation,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kara-siedman-rd-cdces-012a0bab/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kara Siedman, RD, CDCES;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kara Siedman, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sprinkle blueberries into whole-grain pancakes, smoothie bowls or oatmeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Avocados&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considered a fruit, avocados are one of the only fruit sources rich in healthy monounsaturated fat. Yates explains, “Avocados, rich in fiber and healthy fats, provide an excellent food source for gut bacteria and help to reduce inflammation in the digestive tract.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 30-year prospective study found that men who consumed one or more servings of avocado per week had a 15% lower risk of total cancer compared to those consuming less than one serving per month. In addition, men consuming at least one weekly serving of avocado had a significantly decreased risk of colorectal, lung and bladder cancer.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smash avocado and use it as a topper for whole-grain toast, whip up some guacamole to dip cut-up veggies in, or mix it with legumes in whole-grain burrito bowls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Apples&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples have a lot to offer nutritionally, and most research has focused on their phenolic compounds, which are responsible for the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiproliferative (helps block cancer cell growth) effects in plant foods. Research shows that, on average, apples account for 22% of our total phenol intake. On top of that, the type of phenolic compounds in apples are in a form that’s easier for our bodies to use, compared to those in some other fruits like pears, plums and peaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raajasekar recommends eating apples because they contain quercetin, a bioactive flavonoid known for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anticancer properties. Most research on quercetin has been conducted in laboratory settings, so more clinical, human research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples are also a good source of fiber, especially when consumed with the skin on. Snack on apples with cinnamon and nut butter, or add them to your favorite overnight oats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Red Grapes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Red grapes have polyphenols that may help slow cancer cell growth and prevent cancer,” says Raajasekar. According to the American Institute of Cancer Research, the potential benefits of grapes are likely to come from multiple compounds, including flavonols, phenolic acids, resveratrol, flavonl-3-ols, anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t like red grapes, you can get some of these compounds in green ones, too. Enjoy them as a delicious and refreshing treat, or pair them with your favorite nuts or Greek yogurt for a nutrient-rich snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Kiwi&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two kiwis provide about 112 milligrams of vitamin C, more than 100% of your daily needs. “Vitamin C is an antioxidant believed to protect the gastrointestinal lining from oxidative damage. It also helps to limit cancer-causing agents, like nitrosamines, from being formed. Nitrosamines are derived from heating proteins during meat processing or under the heavily acidic conditions in the stomach,” says Yates. Grab a spoon and eat your kiwi whole, or make it a colorful and delicious addition to your fruit salad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Tomatoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomatoes contain lycopene, a carotenoid that gives tomatoes their beautiful color. “Carotenoids like beta carotene, lycopene and lutein help regulate cell growth,” says Siedman. Research shows that nonstarchy veggies like tomatoes play a role in reducing the risk of oral, lung, stomach and colorectal cancers. But when it comes to prostate cancer, the research is mixed. Some studies suggest that populations who consume more lycopene have a lower rate of prostate cancer, while others show no clear link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While further research is needed, tomatoes remain a tasty and nutritious fruit to include in your diet. Roast tomatoes and add them to vegetable medleys, salads, sauces, stews and soups. Cooking tomatoes with a little olive oil can increase the absorption of lycopene, thanks to the added fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Ways to Reduce Cancer Risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raajasekar shares some of his top evidence-backed methods to reduce the risk of cancer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise regularly:&lt;/strong&gt; “Physical activity in the form of cardiovascular and strength training and maintaining a healthy body weight for your height, age and frame reduces the risk of some cancers,” says Raajasekar. Research has also found a connection between lower cancer risk and light-intensity movement, such as running errands or cleaning your house, so every little bit helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protect your skin: &lt;/strong&gt;Sunlight boosts vitamin D and mood, but sun protection is important if you spend time outside. Most skin cancers are caused by too much exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, which can damage skin cells. “Using sunscreen prevents sun-related damage that can lead to some skin cancers,” recommends Raajasekar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit alcohol and don’t smoke:&lt;/strong&gt; “Avoiding smoking and limiting alcohol consumption are other cancer deterrents,” says Raajasekar. Fortunately, delicious mocktails are trendy, and there are many nonalcoholic beverage options to sip on and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on a nutrient-dense eating pattern:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to eating a variety of colorful fruits, Raajasekar recommends adopting a balanced diet rich in fiber, vegetables, healthy fats and minimally processed foods. Focus on eating a variety of colors of plant-based foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fill up on fiber. &lt;/strong&gt;Aim to eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds daily. Diets high in fiber are associated with a reduced risk of several types of cancer. Women should aim for at least 25 to 28 grams of fiber per day, and men, 28 to 34 grams per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep up with cancer screenings: &lt;/strong&gt;Discuss age-appropriate screenings with your doctor, as these may vary depending on your medical and family history. “Keeping up with cancer screenings with your doctor is an evidence-backed way to prevent something from turning cancerous,” says Raajasekar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With external risk factors like environment and genetics outside of your control, it’s empowering to know that simply adding certain fruits to your eating plan can be a step toward cancer prevention. From kiwi and avocados to apples and blueberries, there are so many delicious ways to protect your health and reduce your cancer risk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fruits-for-lower-cancer-risk-11800236" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EatingWell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EatingWell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 15:22:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTFBHalowdTdZd3FsbTNBaWhWYmhPSm96VVBEOWQtVjZ2WS0wTkp1VU14ajlPZ0RmQVlwZXFfMXFpbDdGaXpTUXhyc0ltbXF1bXM5OGhGXzBQTWRQUDBlNk5HODhONC0yeWdZWm1lcA</guid></item><item><title>以下是如何正式修复一颗破碎的心–根据科学家的说法-独立报</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/broken-heart-cure-exercise-therapy-study-b2817075.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gryCYY sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 dmMyEN"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 fXvmgM"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 hJPJVF"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 lcJUSj"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 laZbyn"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cKWiEj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

It is often caused by severe emotional or physical stress, such as&lt;a href="/topic/bereavement"&gt; bereavement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The syndrome mimics the symptoms of a heart attack and doubles the risk of early death for those affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr David Gamble, from the&lt;a href="/topic/aberdeen-university"&gt; University of Aberdeen&lt;/a&gt;, said: “In Takotsubo syndrome, there are serious effects on the heart, which may not return to normal. We know that patients can be affected for the rest of their lives and that their long-term heart health is similar to people who have survived a heart attack.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bRFELa"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/26/00/8828fe65c1b3f327741f64a4c9906195Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzU2MjAwNDQ0-2.79533670.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/26/00/8828fe65c1b3f327741f64a4c9906195Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzU2MjAwNDQ0-2.79533670.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/26/00/8828fe65c1b3f327741f64a4c9906195Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzU2MjAwNDQ0-2.79533670.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Those in the heart recovery programme underwent 12 weeks of prescribed exercise" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-131187"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Those in the heart recovery programme underwent 12 weeks of prescribed exercise&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (PA Wire)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial was the first of its kind and funded by the&lt;a href="/topic/british-heart-foundation"&gt; British Heart Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in&lt;a href="/topic/madrid"&gt; Madrid&lt;/a&gt;, the world’s largest heart conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was found that cognitive behavioural therapy and a heart recovery exercise programme resulted in physical improvements in patients with Takotsubo syndrome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Gamble said: “These results further highlight the importance of ‘the brain-heart axis’. It shows that cognitive behavioural therapy or exercise could help patients along the road to recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial randomly assigned 76 patients diagnosed with the condition to receive cognitive behavioural therapy, an exercise programme, or standard care. Those in the exercise programme were prescribed several forms of exercise, including cycling, running, and swimming, over the course of 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 fTiivP"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/08/11/14/A-new-scientific-review-suggests-walking-can-offer-many-impressive-benefits-beyond-simply-reducing-a.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/08/11/14/A-new-scientific-review-suggests-walking-can-offer-many-impressive-benefits-beyond-simply-reducing-a.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/08/11/14/A-new-scientific-review-suggests-walking-can-offer-many-impressive-benefits-beyond-simply-reducing-a.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Those in the exercise programme could walk an average of 528 metres in six minutes by the end of the trial, up from an average of 457 metres" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-131188"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Those in the exercise programme could walk an average of 528 metres in six minutes by the end of the trial, up from an average of 457 metres&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the trial, those in the exercise programme could walk an average of 528 metres in six minutes, up from an average of 457 metres beforehand.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study co-authored by a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor finds that life expectancy gains made by high-income countries in the first half of the 20th century have slowed significantly, and that none of the generations born after 1939 will reach 100 years of age on average.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2519179122" target="_blank"&gt;Published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt;, the study by Héctor Pifarré i Arolas of the La Follette School of Public Affairs, José Andrade of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, and Carlo Giovanni Camarda of the Institut national d'études démographiques analyzed &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/life+expectancy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; for 23 high-income and low-mortality countries using data from the Human Mortality Database and six different mortality forecasting methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The unprecedented increase in life expectancy we achieved in the first half of the 20th century appears to be a phenomenon we are unlikely to achieve again in the foreseeable future," says Pifarré i Arolas. "In the absence of any major breakthroughs that significantly extend human life, life expectancy would still not match the rapid increases seen in the early 20th century even if adult survival improved twice as fast as we predict."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1900 to 1938, life expectancy rose by about five and a half months with each new generation. The life expectancy for an individual born in a high-income country in 1900 was an average of 62 years. For someone born just 38 years later in similar conditions, life expectancy had jumped to 80 years on average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those born between 1939 and 2000, the increase slowed to roughly two and a half to three and a half months per generation, depending on the forecasting method. Mortality forecasting methods are statistical techniques that make informed predictions about future lifespans based on past and current mortality information. These models enabled the research team to estimate how life expectancy will develop under a variety of plausible future scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;"We forecast that those born in 1980 will not live to be 100 on average, and none of the cohorts in our study will reach this milestone. This decline is largely due to the fact that past surges in longevity were driven by remarkable improvements in survival at very young ages," says corresponding author Andrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the 20th century, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/infant+mortality/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;infant mortality&lt;/a&gt; fell rapidly due to medical advances and other improvements in quality of life for &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/high-income+countries/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high-income countries&lt;/a&gt;. This contributed significantly to the rapid increase in life expectancy. However, infant and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/child+mortality/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;child mortality&lt;/a&gt; is now so low that the forecasted improvements in mortality in older age groups will not be enough to sustain the previous pace of longevity gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While mortality forecasts can never be certain as the future may unfold in unexpected ways—by way of pandemics, new medical treatments or other unforeseen societal changes—this study provides critical insight for governments looking to anticipate the needs of their health care systems, pension planning and social policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although a population-level analysis, this research also has implications for individuals, as life expectancy influences personal decisions about saving, retirement and long-term planning. If life expectancy increases more slowly, as this study shows is likely, both governments and individuals may need to recalibrate their expectations for the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By merging components of four different hormones into a single drug, researchers aim to combat obesity while also tackling related conditions such as type 2 diabetes, cancer, and &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;cardiovascular disease&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Cardiovascular disease (CVD) encompasses a range of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels, including coronary artery disease, heart attack, stroke, and hypertension. These conditions are primarily driven by atherosclerosis, a process where plaque builds up in the arterial walls, leading to narrowed or blocked arteries. Risk factors include smoking, unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, obesity, and genetic predisposition. CVD remains a leading cause of global mortality, emphasizing the importance of lifestyle changes, medical interventions, and preventive measures in managing and reducing the risk of heart-related illnesses.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 15 million adults in the United States, representing about 4.5% of the population, are currently prescribed weight loss medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy. These treatments have shown strong results, but they also come with significant limitations. Once patients stop taking them, the weight loss effects often fade, and potential risks like bone loss, muscle reduction, and persistent nausea have raised concerns about their long-term safety. The nausea in particular can make it difficult for many people to continue treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to these challenges, a research team at &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/tufts-university/"&gt;Tufts University&lt;/a&gt;, led by Krishna Kumar, Robinson Professor of Chemistry, has developed a new type of compound that they hope will deliver better outcomes with fewer negative effects. Their findings were published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most existing drugs in this area are designed to act on one, two, or sometimes three hormone receptors that influence glucose metabolism and appetite. The Tufts researchers, however, have uncovered a fourth receptor that could be added to the mix, potentially offering a more powerful and balanced approach to managing weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Obesity is linked to over 180 different disease conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis, liver disease, and type 2 diabetes, and affects over 650 million people worldwide,” said Kumar. “What drives us is the idea that we can design a single drug to treat obesity and simultaneously mitigate the risk of developing a long list of health problems plaguing society.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How the Drugs Work&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we eat a meal, our gut and brain trigger a hormonal “fuel gauge” that regulates levels of glucose and tells us when we have had enough to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is released to help stimulate the production of &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;insulin&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, crucial for regulating blood glucose levels. It helps cells in the body absorb glucose from the bloodstream and convert it into energy or store it for future use. Insulin production and action are essential for maintaining stable blood sugar levels. In people with diabetes, the body either does not produce enough insulin (Type 1 diabetes) or cannot effectively use the insulin it does produce (Type 2 diabetes), leading to elevated levels of glucose in the blood. This can cause various health complications over time, including heart disease, kidney damage, and nerve dysfunction. Insulin therapy, where insulin is administered through injections or an insulin pump, is a common treatment for managing diabetes, particularly Type 1. The discovery of insulin in 1921 by Frederick Banting and Charles Best was a landmark in medical science, transforming diabetes from a fatal disease to a manageable condition.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;insulin&lt;/span&gt; and the uptake of glucose in muscle and other tissues. With the cells now loaded with fuel, the level of glucose in the blood returns to normal. Ozempic uses GLP-1 with slight modifications to increase its availability in the bloodstream. Its success in controlling blood glucose has prompted the American Diabetes Association to recommend it and other GLP-1-based drugs as the new first line injectable treatments for diabetes, ahead of insulin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But GLP-1 also acts directly on the brain, making us feel full after having a meal, and it slows down the rate that the stomach contents are emptied into the intestines, creating a more evenly paced release of nutrients and glucose into the bloodstream. That’s why it has also become extremely popular as a weight loss treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s still not a perfect drug strategy for weight loss, though. “The biggest problem with GLP-1 drugs is that they have to be injected once a week, and they can induce a very strong feeling of nausea,” said Kumar. “As much as 40% of people using these drugs give up after the first month.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_491433" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-491433" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Hormonal-Response-After-Eating-Graphic.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-491433" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Hormonal-Response-After-Eating-Graphic-777x449.jpg" alt="Hormonal Response After Eating Graphic" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Hormonal-Response-After-Eating-Graphic-777x449.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Hormonal-Response-After-Eating-Graphic-400x231.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Hormonal-Response-After-Eating-Graphic-768x444.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Hormonal-Response-After-Eating-Graphic-1536x887.jpg 1536w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Hormonal-Response-After-Eating-Graphic-2048x1183.jpg 2048w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Hormonal-Response-After-Eating-Graphic-150x87.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Hormonal-Response-After-Eating-Graphic-450x260.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Hormonal-Response-After-Eating-Graphic-1200x693.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-491433" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Four primary hormones are released after eating: GLP-1 (blue), GIP (red), glucagon (violet) and PYY (green). Each hormone targets its own receptor. The effect of each receptor on the body are indicated using the same color code. The tetra-agonist compound designed by the Tufts team has components of each hormone and can activate each of the four same hormone receptors. The small grey circles on the tetra-agonist represent an attached lipid molecule that helps the tetra-agonist remain in the bloodstream longer by binding to albumin.

&lt;p&gt;A second hormone released after eating is glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP). It also makes us feel full after a meal. GIP looks a lot like GLP-1, so rather than administer two drugs, researchers created one peptide that incorporates structural elements of both—what’s called in drug development a chimera. That drug, called Mounjaro or Zepbound (the brand names for tirzepatide), has the added benefit of significantly reducing nausea. As a more tolerable treatment, it may overtake Ozempic in the weight loss market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And then there is a third hormone, glucagon,” said Kumar. “Paradoxically, it actually increases blood glucose, but at the same time increases the expenditure of energy in cells of the body, raises body temperature, and suppresses appetite.” By adding glucagon to the mix, GLP-1 and GIP end up neutralizing its glucose-enhancing effect, leaving the remaining functionalities of all three hormones working together to enhance weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glucagon is also similar in structure to GLP-1 and GIP, so drug developers created a single chimera peptide that incorporates elements of all three hormones, which can be recognized by their three separate receptors. That drug, called retatrudide, is currently in clinical trials that indicate even greater achievable weight loss (up to 24%) compared to the original GLP-1 drugs (6-15%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Going for the Weight Loss Gold Standard with a Fourth Target&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The goal that people are trying to shoot for is bariatric surgery,” said Kumar. That’s a surgical procedure significantly reducing the size of the stomach, which can achieve long-lasting weight loss up to 30%. “For individuals with persistent obesity and potential deadly associated conditions, it becomes a necessary but invasive treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current injectable weight loss drugs still fall short of that gold standard, so the Tufts chemists are focused on a drug redesign that could match the 30% weight loss outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is one more hormone we wanted to bring in to complete a weight control quartet,” said Tristan Dinsmore, a graduate student in the Kumar lab and the lead author of the study. “It’s called peptide YY (PYY). This molecule is also secreted by the gut after we eat a meal, and its job is to reduce appetite and slow the process of emptying food from the stomach, but via different mechanisms than either GLP-1 or GIP. It may also be involved in directly ‘burning off’ fat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PYY is from a separate and structurally unrelated class of hormones than the first three, so blending its structure into a chimeric peptide that also mimics GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon was not easy. Instead, the Tufts team was able to join two peptide segments end-to-end, creating a new ‘tetra-functional’ clinical candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the limitations of the current drugs is that individual variation, possibly including how people express target receptors or respond to their corresponding hormones, can lead to lesser than desired weight loss outcomes in many patients,” said Martin Beinborn, visiting scholar in the Department of Chemistry. “By hitting four different hormone receptors at the same time, we hope to improve the chances of averaging out such variation toward the goal of achieving greater and more consistent overall effectiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A second issue is that patients tend to regain weight after discontinuing currently available GLP-1 related drugs,” said Beinborn, who notes that lifestyle changes should ideally be a complement to medication treatment. This two-pronged approach will not only support reaching and keeping one’s target weight, but may also help preserve bone and muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Recent studies indicate that weight rebound after drug discontinuation is delayed with the newer, more effective GLP-1 mimetics,” he said. “Extending from this observation, one may speculate that multi-chimeras along the lines of the one we discovered could get us closer to the bariatric surgery standard of lasting weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt;

As health care spending continues to rise, providers are being asked to warn patients about any potential unexpected costs – for example, insurance charges for additional services at an otherwise fully covered annual wellness visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sign that inspired it all.

So we conducted some experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In two studies, we found that when people saw an insurance warning sign, they were less willing to raise a wide variety of issues during a physical exam. These included both short-term issues such as headaches, fatigue and arthritis pain in the finger joints, and previously diagnosed, chronic conditions including high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes and asthma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a third study, we tested whether it was what the sign said – or just the mere presence of a sign mentioning costs – that made people reluctant to speak up. We showed participants either no sign, an insurance warning sign, or a sign about a prescription drug discount program, which was also modeled after a real sign in the same doctor’s office. Only people who saw the insurance sign were less likely to speak up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Frank conversations between patients and providers are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.165.20.2378" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:essential for good health care;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;essential for good health care&lt;/a&gt;. They allow providers to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327027hc0604_2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tailor medications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;tailor medications&lt;/a&gt;, reduce side effects and find treatments that are right for each patient. What’s more, treating issues earlier rather than later &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2196/16713" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:generally leads to better outcomes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;generally leads to better outcomes&lt;/a&gt; and costs less in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We found that insurance warning signage, no matter how necessary or well intended, can discourage patients from sharing important health information. This could cause delays in important care, leading to unnecessary discomfort and stress as patients suffer with untreated issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Health care offices need to include certain insurance disclosures to inform patients of their rights under the &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/medical-bill-rights" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:No Surprises Act;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;No Surprises Act&lt;/a&gt;, which took effect in 2022. However, providers and administrators should be aware that their patients may often have cost concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Doctors’ offices can try to find ways to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2022.04.005" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:communicate potential insurance costs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;communicate potential insurance costs&lt;/a&gt; while also encouraging patients to have open and honest discussions with their providers. The signage at the office that inspired this work had many words bolded and underlined, which may have made it feel especially aggressive to some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s important for patients to know that they should never ignore symptoms. In fact, raising a concern as early as possible with a doctor or another health care provider can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-013-2543-9" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:save more money down the road;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;save more money down the road&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What still isn’t known&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We weren’t able to study the long-term impacts of such signs, and it’s possible they have even more negative effects than we uncovered – for example, by making patients reluctant to have &lt;a href="https://www.macombmedicalclinicpc.com/blog/why-you-should-never-skip-your-annual-wellness-exam" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:annual wellness visits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;annual wellness visits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s also unclear &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/cpt/can-physicians-bill-both-preventive-and-em-services-same-visit" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:how often health care professionals actually report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;how often health care professionals actually report&lt;/a&gt; such conversations to insurers, especially when the issues are brought up briefly during a checkup and don’t require additional testing or treatment at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But the research is clear on one point: When patients feel they can speak freely to their doctors, they get better care. That’s why doctors and other health care professionals should be aware that even well-intended warning signs may encourage patients to keep silent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research Brief;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Research Brief&lt;/a&gt; is a short take on interesting academic work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="http://theconversation.com/us?utm_source=Yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=related-link&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related-link-0&amp;amp;utm_content=article-262303" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Conversation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

						&lt;p&gt;Duke University's Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center will
soon offer new mental and emotional support for its patients, their families
and their caregivers — all thanks to the donation of a former patient's daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Durham native Rebecca Feinglos donated $250,000 to create the
Susan &amp;amp; Mark Feinglos Grief initiative in honor of her parents. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The program
was announced on Saturday, which is National Grief Awareness Day.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The money will support the creation of a grief pilot program to
support people connected to care at the tumor center.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Feinglos has lots of memories of Duke University and its medical
center.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"My parents came to Durham in 1972. My dad started his
residency at Duke and they never left," Feinglos said. "My mom
eventually became the director of the Duke Medical Center Library. My dad rose
in the ranks of the endocrine division here. He eventually became the Chief of
the division."&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Not all her memories are good ones. Her mom was diagnosed with
Glioblastoma, the most deadly form of brain cancer when Feinglos was
five-years-old.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;"I don’t have a lot of great (memories). I have a lot of
scary ones. I remember being scared of things. It is scary when your person is
going through any cancer," Feinglos said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Her mother, Susan Feingloss, died eight years later. Leaving
Rebecca's father, Mark, to raise her and her brother as a single parent.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"My dad was my best friend," Feinglos said. "Most
of my favorite memories with my dad are basketball games and Duke football
games."&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Feinglos was working in education when her dad died of a sudden
illness in March of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"My mom's death is something I survived through and overcame.
That was a really hard thing in my life and I got through it and I was over it
and then when my dad died, it made me learn that you’re never over your
grief," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Feinglos changed careers after her dad's death and started a grief
support organization called Grieve Leave.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"I am unlucky enough that my grief has been front-loaded and
I now I think have a weird privilege that I get to use the knowledge that I
have and help other people," Feinglos said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;h2&gt;"It’s an extraordinary problem and no one until [Rebecca] has addressed this."&lt;/h2&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;As a continuation of her work to support those grieving, she has
now launched a philanthropy called the Feinglos Fund. It is through this fund
and Grieve Leave that she was able to donate the money to start the new grief program at
Duke's Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"What we don’t have is anything that addresses the grief that
(patients), their family members and the medical team all feel from this,"
Dr. Henry S. Friedman said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Doctors Henry Friedman and Allen Friedman are Co-Deputy Directors
of the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center. They also knew Feinglos'
parents and treated her mother.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"What do you say to a 5 year-old when her mom has a brain too
and how do you get the kid through that and that’s always been sort of in the
DNA of the brain quality of life work," Dr. Allen Friedman said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Dr. Henry Friedman said Duke's brain tumor center gets 3000
applications for care every year. Of those, the center treats about a thousand
patients annually.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"We send out a list every month of the number of patients
that we’ve lost and it's a very lengthy list," Dr. Henry Friedman said.
&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"But we don’t have though is any way to really help the patient while
they're being treated or in palliative care mode, for families either before or
after and medical care team that takes care of them, deal with the grief which
we will feel. It’s an extraordinary problem and no one until Becky has
addressed this."&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Over the next five years, the money donated will go towards
researching best practices for how to provide grief support and putting the
findings into practice at the brain tumor center. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Feinglos hopes the program
will serve as a model for other healthcare systems in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

The hospital was also linked to an 2021 outbreak that hospitalized more than a dozen people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dchia"&gt;Don Weiss, a former city health official who helped coordinate past responses to infectious disease outbreaks, was critical of the fact that Harlem Hospital was once again at the center of an outbreak’s origins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="c1nv6"&gt;“They should’ve been keeping a really close eye on that,” Weiss said. “You should be way above the testing requirements to make sure you’re never again showing up on the news.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="53ro9"&gt;The second building was a construction site for a public health lab at 40 West 137th St. overseen by the NYC Economic Development Corporation and the construction contractor Skanska USA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="fr9l"&gt;According to publicly available health department data, the hospital had been in compliance with rules requiring it to submit Legionella testing samples every three months. Its most recent sample before the outbreak was submitted in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="69o9e"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/legionnaires-inspections-sank-to-near-record-low-ahead-of-nyc-outbreak" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;previous Gothamist analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that the rate of city inspections for cooling towers has been declining since the regulations were first implemented. After an increase in inspections immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic, numbers of inspections dropped again starting in 2022, after Mayor Eric Adams took office. The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene attributed the drop to staffing shortages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8f7kb"&gt;Morse, the health commissioner, said the buildings were identified through matching genetic samples from both the cooling towers and the people who were sickened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="832h"&gt;During the briefing, Deputy Commissioner Corinne Schiff, who oversees the Division of Environmental Health, said she didn’t know whether the construction site had conducted regular Legionella testing but that the department would investigate the site’s testing history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="cs5i6"&gt;According to public data, however, there are no records of Legionella testing or city inspections for the construction site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ag1po"&gt;Chris Boyd, a former assistant commissioner at the health department who helped write new regulations for cooling towers in the wake of a 2015 outbreak that killed 16 people, said this outbreak was completely preventable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1npf2"&gt;“The health department is masking the fact that this is not a naturally occurring phenomena,” he said. “It only occurs in systems that are not managed properly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="e32d8"&gt;Following Friday’s briefing, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a current mayoral candidate, called on the state Department of Health to conduct an independent investigation of the city’s handling of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8aeqi"&gt;“With the source of this outbreak now tied to a city-run facility, it is all the more important that an independent review be undertaken to ensure accountability, transparency, and public trust,” Cuomo wrote in a &lt;a href="https://us17.campaign-archive.com/?u=6261123845ede52d0d0ec256e&amp;amp;id=99dd2ed872" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="84mhm"&gt;In response to the outbreak, Morse said the department will raise fines for building owners who fail to regularly test for Legionella bacteria. The department will also require building owners to test every 30 days instead of the currently required 90 days, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6hv3r"&gt;Additionally, Morse said the department will also try to hire more water ecologists to address the current staff shortage, but she did not provide details on whether the budget for those staff vacancies would be increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6etrp"&gt;A Gothamist &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lost-health-inspectors-in-years-preceding-harlem-legionnaires-disease-outbreak" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that the health department lost more than a third of its cooling tower inspectors in the past three years, despite a boost in funding for the unit in the department that conducts the inspections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 14:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPWnRpaDdhR3hOR0FONjZuS3plVEt1MTdRUG8yNGY3U09EeU1RQmx2SjRaaFBxby1nQXZoVzhIMDFMMi1SLXJUcG1OMk5MZmxMQ0gtNDU2UEt0T2p0dTR0dlR6NW9jNUdiT3Qwem0zMW9GdzBOMXlCNFlmRkFscVhEZEJMU2JiMlBSTk5RSkVjX0p1VlhFR1BFaDRVaEZwdw</guid></item><item><title>胃脑沟通可预测情绪症状和幸福感，研究发现- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-08-stomach-brain-communication-emotional-symptoms.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internal physiological states, such as digestion, breathing and heartbeat, have been consistently linked to mental, psychological and emotional experiences. This body-mind connection is known to be supported by interoception, the innate ability to sense internal physiological states and sensations, such as hunger, thirst, pain, the urge to use the toilet, heartbeats, breathing and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;A crucial interoceptive signal is the so-called gastric rhythm, the electrical oscillation regularly produced by the stomach as a means to facilitate digestion. This rhythm has been connected to activity in the frontoparietal network, a connected set of brain regions that contributes to the regulation of emotions and attention-related processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past studies suggest that the communication between the gastric rhythm and the frontoparietal network, broadly referred to as visceral-brain coupling or gastric-brain coupling, could play a role in some mental health disorders, including anxiety, depression and stress-related conditions. Yet much about the link between visceral-brain coupling and emotional or &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psychological+symptoms/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psychological symptoms&lt;/a&gt; has not yet been elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Aarhus University and the German Institute of Human Nutrition have carried out a new study aimed at further exploring this relationship by looking at both the mental health symptoms of a group of people and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electrical+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electrical activity&lt;/a&gt; in their stomachs. Their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-025-00468-6" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/i&gt;, suggests that a stronger synchronization between the stomach and the brain is often linked to poorer mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Visceral rhythms orchestrate the physiological states underlying &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+emotion/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human emotion&lt;/a&gt;," wrote Leah Banellis, Ignacio Rebollo and their colleagues in their paper. "Chronic aberrations in these brain–body interactions are implicated in a broad spectrum of mental health disorders. However, the relationship between gastric–brain coupling and affective symptoms remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between this novel interoceptive axis and mental health in 243 participants, using a cross-validated machine learning approach."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Banellis, Rebollo and their colleagues assessed the mental health of participants using a test that prompted them to share their emotional, mental, social and somatic experiences. They also recorded the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electrical+signals/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electrical signals&lt;/a&gt; and activity in the participants' stomachs, using two widely used experimental techniques known as electrogastrography (EGG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We find that increased frontoparietal brain coupling to the gastric rhythm indexes a dimensional signature of poorer mental health, spanning anxiety, depression, stress and well-being," wrote Banellis, Rebollo and their colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Control analyses confirm the specificity of these interactions to the gastric–brain axis. Our study proposes coupling between the stomach and brain as a factor in mental health and offers potential new targets for interventions remediating aberrant brain–body coupling."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of this team's investigation further emphasize the connection between gastric-brain coupling and emotional or psychological well-being, unveiling patterns that are linked to greater anxiety, low mood, stress and poor mental health. Other researchers could soon conduct additional studies exploring the processes via which &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/strong+connections/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;strong connections&lt;/a&gt; between visceral signals and the brain contribute to specific &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mental+health+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mental health disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, these works could collectively pave the way for the development of new therapeutic strategies aimed at easing the symptoms of stress-related psychological conditions by tackling anomalous gastric-&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; communication patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

They’re always happy to be by our side, whether we’re laughing or needing comfort, and they somehow seem to know what we need before we do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For this adorable &lt;strong&gt;Golden Retriever Puppy&lt;/strong&gt;, that loyalty extends to his beloved toys. While most young dogs have short attention spans, this little guy stayed glued to the washer door, keeping watch through the wash cycle until it was time to be reunited with his favorites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Watch this faithful friend in the video shared on August 19:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Lord Archibald (@&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@archibald.the.lord" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:archibald.the.lord;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;archibald.the.lord&lt;/a&gt;) may only be a few months old, but he already understands the value of lasting friendships.

Soft toys in particular can mimic the feeling of companionship and even trigger nurturing instincts, especially in breeds like Golden Retrievers, who are known for their &lt;span&gt;caring&lt;/span&gt;, family-oriented nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Watch him trade his watermelon toy for a taste of the real thing in this video from August 20:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Whether Archie lets his toys wash without needing to keep a close eye on them in the future, remains to be seen.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Food for Life’s Ezekiel 4:9 Sprouted Whole Grain Cereal is a top pick for gut health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This cereal is rich in fiber, nutrients and plants that support a healthy gut microbiome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For extra nutrition, add fruit, probiotic-rich dairy or nuts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to gut health, your food choices matter. The right foods not only keep you regular, but also feed your gut microbes, support digestion and make nutrients easier to absorb. One often-overlooked food is cereal—a surprisingly good choice for gut health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But with endless cereal boxes lining the grocery store aisles, which is the best cereal for gut health? We asked a gastroenterologist to share his top pick.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gastroenterologist &lt;a href="https://theplantfedgut.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Will Bulsiewicz, M.D., MSCI&lt;/a&gt;, says his favorite cereal for gut health is &lt;a href="https://www.foodforlife.com/product/cereals/ezekiel-49-sprouted-whole-grain-cereal" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Food for Life's Ezekiel 4:9 Sprouted Whole Grain Cereal&lt;/a&gt;. He recommends this cereal for its high fiber content and mix of sprouted grains and legumes, which provide a diverse range of plant-based fibers. That diversity matters—research shows that eating a variety of plants is linked to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;healthier, more resilient gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Seven Plants in Every Bowl &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the simplest ways to support gut health is to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-eat-every-week-for-a-healthy-gut-8696826" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eat more plants&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m a huge advocate for focusing on adding more varieties of plants to our diet,” says Bulsiewicz. That’s because each plant contributes its own fibers and phytonutrients, which help to fuel a healthier gut microbiome, he explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research from the American Gut Project found that people with the healthiest guts were eating at least 30 different plants per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; With seven plants in one bowl—wheat, barley, millet, lentils, soybeans, spelt and rosemary—this cereal makes it easy to achieve that goal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Made with Sprouted Grains &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sprouted grains are especially important for gut health because sprouting changes their nutrition. Sprouting starts the germination process in seeds and legumes, activating enzymes that naturally enhance their nutritional profile. “It increases the bioavailability of iron, zinc and other minerals, lowers phytic acid and other antinutrients, and generally results in food that’s easier to digest,” says Bulsiewicz.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These changes make sprouted grains a smart choice for both nutrition and gut health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s High in Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber plays many roles in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrients-to-support-gut-health-11791719" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supporting a healthy gut&lt;/a&gt;: it strengthens the gut lining, supports digestion and absorption of nutrients, feeds beneficial gut bacteria and helps to lower cholesterol and blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The problem is, an estimated 90% of adults do not eat enough fiber, which is why it’s important to start making it a priority.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By adding this to your diet, you can get an impressive 6 grams of fiber—21% of your daily fiber needs—in a half-cup serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Certified Organic &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Organic certification means the grains and legumes in this cereal are grown without most synthetic pesticides, fertilizers or genetically modified organisms (GMOs). “This also means that they weren’t sprayed with glyphosate after harvest, a common weed killer that’s often used to dry out wheat, legumes and other whole grains,” says Bulsiewicz. He points out that some research suggests glyphosate can negatively affect the gut microbiome, which is why he prefers to avoid it whenever possible.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

After reading about low-dose minoxidil a few years ago, I got a prescription from my general practitioner and have been taking it ever since. My fine hair began to thin with menopause, and I could barely make a ponytail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F2LDXKIAXZBIDFFV47RSLCFJGE"&gt;I estimate its quantity has increased by 30% to 40% without any apparent side effects. For the first time in years, the hairline around my face has filled in and I’m not obliged to have a short fringe. Having more hair has been a great improvement and I will continue to take 2.5 milligrams of minoxidil daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4FOOHKLXGRBGPLJB7JCHRENMDM"&gt;A. A recent systematic review of 27 studies of this off-label use of the blood pressure pill minoxidil found that 35% to 47% of participants noticed improved hair growth (Frontiers in Pharmacology, June 3, 2025). Most side effects were minor, although some people had unwanted hair growth and a few reported swollen ankles. The dose you are taking appears to be in line with the effective dose in these studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PTNDC2S4QJF33KLZXL652I4ZPY"&gt;Minoxidil was originally approved to treat high blood pressure in 1979. The oral dose ranges from 5 to 100 milligrams daily. At those doses, though, side effects can be severe. Low-dose minoxidil (0.25 milligrams to 5 milligrams) is considered much safer but still requires medical supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM" data-fusion-component="FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM" data-fusion-component="FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AW27S6DSHFCL3LRTWJSJCAN7NU"&gt;Q.

When participants listened to folk music, they imagined vivid social scenes such as being with friends, even when lyrics were removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with silence, music consistently amplified mental imagery tied to warmth and connection. These results highlight music’s potential as a low-cost tool to reduce loneliness and support mental health therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Imagery:&lt;/strong&gt; Music evoked vivid scenes of togetherness, even without lyrics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global Study:&lt;/strong&gt; 600 participants produced over 4,000 imagination reports.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Promise:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may support new mental health interventions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Sydney&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you ever felt like music keeps you company? Does music truly offer companionship or is it simply a figure of speech? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study led by Dr Steffen A. Herff, cognitive neuroscientist at Sydney, Music, Mind and Body Lab at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, has shown for the first time empirically that music can indeed keep you company by facilitating imagined social interactions.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Music appears to act as a catalyst for social imagination,” Dr Herff said. “Even without words or voices, it can trigger thoughts of connection, warmth and companionship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Music keeps you company&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whether we’re celebrating or grieving, music is something we can turn to,” Dr Herff said. “This study shows that beyond shaping our emotions, music can also shape our thoughts and imagination, highlighting that music can indeed be good company.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Herff said the findings offer new insight into how music can shape higher order cognitive processes like imagination. The team hopes that the finding may help develop low-cost, easily accessible ways of systematically using music to alleviate feelings of loneliness, especially in times of isolation such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and complement existing recreational, artistic and professional usages of imagination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We observed compelling support that music can systematically strengthen and shape mental imagery and induce social themes into imagination. That is a very powerful thing,” Dr Herff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has great implications for our understanding of music, understanding of imagination, but also carries practical implications for cognitive behavioural therapies that use mental imagery techniques.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, music could be used to enhance clinical therapeutic practices that rely on mental imagery, such as exposure therapy for specific phobias or guided visualisation, such as those used in therapy for PTSD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has just published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr Herff is a University of Sydney Horizon Research Fellow, ARC DECRA Fellow and leader of the Sydney, Music, Mind and Body Lab at Sydney Conservatorium of Music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can music help shape your thoughts?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Herff and his team of researchers set out to examine if there is an empirically observable effect of music on social thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over four years, they conducted a large-scale study, which involved 600 participants around the world to understand how music can shape imagination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked to close their eyes and imagine journeys towards topographical landmarks, such as a mountain. They did this either in silence or while listening to music. After each imagined journey, they provided responses and detailed accounts of what they imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used computational models to identify common themes in these descriptions and found that music consistently inspired thoughts of social connection such as spending time with others.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This effect appeared across different songs and even when lyrics or vocals were removed, showing that the feeling of companionship came from the music itself, not just the words. The team also used Generative AI to create visual representations of what people imagined. Such representations are very useful as they allow us to do follow-up studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that compared to silence, when participants listened to music, their imaginations sparked and they described vivid imaginary social scenes, such as dancing and laughing with other people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study deliberately used folk music (from Italy, Spain and Sweden) due to its strong history of social interaction and its perceived ability to induce social thoughts. Participants listened with and without the lyrics and found the voice was not a prerequisite – the music alone increased social imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasise the need to explore other musical genres and cultural contexts – in particular non-Western genres – to deepen understanding of mental imagery and open more, diverse, and better tailored ways of supporting recreational and clinical use of mental imagery techniques.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The publicly available dataset collected by the team now includes over 4,000 imagined journeys, complete with sentiment ratings, topic weights, and visual representations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a second experiment, a new set of participants were able to look at the AI-generated images and identify which ones were inspired by music or not – but only when they did the task listening to music themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This tells us that there is a ‘theory of mind’ when it comes to music-evoked mental imagery,” said Dr Herff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is, people can imagine, what others might be imagining whilst listening to music, which is fascinating.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt; This work was supported by the Australian Government through the Australian Research Council (ARC) under the Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA, DE220100961) awarded to Dr Steffen A.

This effect remained robust irrespective of vocals or language comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using stable diffusion, we generated visualisations of participants’ imagined content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a second experiment, a new group of participants’ ability to differentiate between visualisations of content imagined during silence and music listening increased when they listened to the associated music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results converge to show that music, indeed, can be good company.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 12:59:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE9McnMxVG9tZmxueDZTMEYtbkI2YWRIRC1VbWZYbHhRcTMtZFFSTFFiS3dxZW90MllLdmF0X2poVVUtNEZZVFFXRXhMY21ORlpWcXhyaGVDYmNPQVBYZTZhSGdEdFQ5ME5jOTAwWg</guid></item><item><title>科学家震惊地发现隐藏在帕金森病患者大脑中的所谓无害病毒- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/scientists-shocked-to-find-a-supposedly-harmless-virus-hiding-in-brains-of-parkinsons-patients/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.189988" target="_blank"&gt;JCI Insight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; provides evidence that a little-studied virus called human pegivirus (HPgV) may be present in the brains of people with Parkinson’s disease and could be linked to disruptions in immune function and brain pathology. The virus was detected in brain tissue from patients with Parkinson’s disease but not in control samples, and its presence appeared to influence immune signaling pathways differently depending on patients’ genetic makeup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings do not show that HPgV &lt;em&gt;causes&lt;/em&gt; Parkinson’s disease, but they do indicate that viral infection may interact with genetic risk factors to shape disease progression. The research team suggests that HPgV may play a role in altering immune responses in the brain and blood, potentially contributing to neurodegeneration in some individuals with Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease is a progressive brain disorder that affects movement and often leads to tremors, rigidity, and slowed physical function. It is widely accepted that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the disease, but only a small percentage of cases can be directly linked to inherited mutations. This has led researchers to explore environmental triggers—such as infections—that might influence disease onset or progression, particularly in individuals who are genetically susceptible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viral infections have long been considered potential contributors to Parkinson-like symptoms. During the 1918 influenza pandemic, a wave of encephalitis lethargica cases produced motor symptoms similar to Parkinson’s disease. More recent cases of parkinsonism following infections with flaviviruses like West Nile or Japanese encephalitis virus have raised further questions about viral involvement in brain degeneration. However, most past studies have focused on specific viruses and yielded inconclusive results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, researchers aimed to take a broader approach by examining the entire set of viruses present in the brain tissue—referred to as the “virome”—to determine whether any viruses are uniquely associated with Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our lab studies how viruses in the brain affect health and disease. We have looked at several brain disorders, but this was the first time we saw a connection between one specific virus and a neurodegenerative disease,” said study author Barbara Hanson, a postdoctoral researcher in &lt;a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/koralniklab/" target="_blank"&gt;Igor J. Koralnik’s lab&lt;/a&gt; at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parkinson’s has long been suspected to have links to infections since the observation of parkinsonisms occurring with Spanish flu and encephalitis lethargica, people have wondered if viruses might play a role. That history made us curious to see if the Parkinson’s disease brain had different viruses than brains from people without Parkinson’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed postmortem brain tissue from 10 individuals who had Parkinson’s disease and 14 control individuals of similar age and sex. Samples were taken from three brain regions known to be involved in movement and cognition. The team used ViroFind, a sequencing platform that can detect genetic material from all known human viruses, to screen for viral sequences in these samples. They confirmed their findings using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), a sensitive method for detecting specific viral genes, and verified the presence of viral proteins with immunohistochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the initial virome analysis, human pegivirus was found in 4 of 10 Parkinson’s brains, but in none of the 14 control samples. qPCR testing confirmed these results and identified a fifth HPgV-positive case among the Parkinson’s patients. None of the control brains tested positive for the virus. Further testing showed that three Parkinson’s patients also had HPgV present in their cerebrospinal fluid, while none had detectable levels in their blood plasma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanson and her colleagues. also used RNA sequencing to examine how HPgV infection might affect gene expression in the brain. They compared transcriptomic profiles—that is, the patterns of gene activity—in patients with and without the virus. They then used blood samples from a much larger dataset, the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative, to look for HPgV in peripheral blood and analyze how it might be influencing immune gene expression over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of the virus was associated with more advanced signs of brain pathology, particularly in areas linked to memory and emotion. All HPgV-positive brains showed greater accumulation of tau tangles in the limbic system, suggesting a possible connection between viral infection and disease severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also observed higher levels of a protein called complexin-2 in infected brains, which plays a role in neurotransmitter release. This could indicate changes in synaptic function in those with HPgV. Despite these differences in pathology, patients with and without HPgV did not differ in measures of cognitive performance or clinical diagnosis at the time of their last medical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the blood, only a small fraction of individuals had detectable HPgV—around 1% of Parkinson’s patients and control participants alike. This low rate suggests that the virus is not commonly active in blood at any given time, but its presence still appeared to influence key immune markers. For example, patients with Parkinson’s who had HPgV in their blood showed higher levels of insulin-like growth factor 1, which supports cellular metabolism and growth, and lower levels of a marker linked to mitophagy, a process that helps clear damaged mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised,” Hanson told PsyPost. “HPgV is often thought to be harmless, so we did not expect to find a link to Parkinson’s disease. We also did not detect the virus in the blood, which is unusual because other studies have shown higher levels of the virus outside the brain. This made us think the virus may act differently in Parkinson’s patients than we expected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcriptomic analyses provided further insights. In both the brain and blood, HPgV infection was associated with suppression of IL-4 signaling, a pathway involved in regulating inflammation. This suppression was not seen in uninfected Parkinson’s patients, who tended to show increased IL-4 activity compared to controls. These findings suggest that HPgV infection might alter normal immune regulation in Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of HPgV also differed depending on patients’ genetic background. The researchers examined the gene LRRK2, which is one of the most common genes linked to inherited forms of Parkinson’s disease. In people with LRRK2 mutations, IL-4 signaling decreased as HPgV levels increased. In contrast, in those without the mutation, IL-4 activity increased with higher HPgV levels. This points to a genotype-dependent response to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene expression networks revealed that a protein called YWHAB appeared to serve as a central hub in mediating these different responses. YWHAB is involved in cell signaling, inflammation, and neuron survival, and its expression patterns predicted how other immune-related genes responded to HPgV in different genetic backgrounds. The network of genes interacting with YWHAB included several known to play roles in cell death, mitochondrial function, and neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In patients with the LRRK2 mutation, HPgV infection was associated with increased expression of a group of small RNAs (called SNORAs) that have been linked to immune regulation and cellular stress responses. These RNAs showed the opposite pattern in patients without the mutation, again suggesting that the genetic background of the host shapes how the body responds to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study suggests that infections may influence the biology of Parkinson’s disease,” Hanson explained. “We found that people with changes in the LRRK2 gene reacted to this virus differently than those without the gene change. This means that a person’s genetics affects both the probability that they will develop Parkinson’s disease and the way they respond to this virus. This could work together to affect disease risk. It shows us that looking at both viruses and host genes is important when trying to understand Parkinson’s disease and other diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study provides new evidence that HPgV may be associated with immune and genetic features of Parkinson’s disease, the findings are preliminary and based on a relatively small number of brain samples. The researchers were not able to determine whether HPgV infection occurred before or after disease onset, or whether it directly contributes to disease progression. In addition, the exact mechanisms by which the virus enters the brain or influences immune signaling remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is the lack of standardized tools for detecting HPgV, as there are no commercially available tests. The research team had to develop in-house methods to measure the virus. The rarity of HPgV in blood also limits how easily it can be studied in large populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will need to confirm these findings in larger and more diverse groups of patients and determine how HPgV interacts with genetic and environmental factors over time. The research team also plans to explore whether the virus infects specific cell types in the brain and whether antiviral treatments could influence disease processes. Given HPgV’s similarity to viruses like Hepatitis C, medications used for other flaviviruses may be worth investigating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study opens a new area of research into how persistent but seemingly harmless viruses might interact with neurodegenerative disease processes. Even if HPgV does not directly cause Parkinson’s disease, it may help shape the immune environment in ways that influence disease progression—particularly in individuals who are already at genetic risk. By examining the intersection of infection, immunity, and neurodegeneration, researchers hope to uncover new paths toward understanding and eventually treating Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to see if HPgV is consistently found in the brains of people with Parkinson’s disease from all over the world,” Hanson said. “We also want to figure out which brain cells are infected and how they are changed during infection, and whether patients with other genetic changes show the same patterns. Another goal is to understand how often the virus can enter the brain and what pathways it uses to get there. In the long run, we even want to test whether drugs made for similar viruses, like Hepatitis C, could also work against HPgV.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This project is exciting because it opens a new window into how infections might shape brain disease. We hope our work inspires others to look more closely at viruses that were once thought to be harmless. Even if a virus does not cause disease by itself, it may change how the body responds to other risks like genetics. We believe this could help lead to new ways of preventing or treating Parkinson’s disease in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.189988" target="_blank"&gt;Human pegivirus alters brain and blood immune and transcriptomic profiles of patients with Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Barbara A.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmexcbnv000123b7agb1kzzt8@published"&gt;My mother-in-law, “Patricia,” is a recovering alcoholic with six years of sobriety. Recently, my sister needed me to take her and my 1-year-old nephew to an appointment with his pediatrician (her car was in the shop and her husband was at work). I left my 3-year-old son, “Harry,” with Patricia.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmexcbnwy00133b7avyak35cw@published"&gt;While I was with my sister, I received a call from a neighbor. She had been walking her dog when she came across Harry wandering the neighborhood in tears. He told her that “Grandma won’t wake up.” She took him home and found Patricia passed out. A nearly empty Scotch bottle (which had been a gift from a client to my husband; we don’t drink and were planning to re-gift it) was on the floor. My neighbor called 911, and then she called me. Patricia had to remain hospitalized for two days with alcohol poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmexcbnz300143b7asilu96do@published"&gt;Now my husband is blaming me for not hiding the Scotch “properly,” given that I know his mother’s history. The bottle was in our pantry behind the cereal boxes! The top of the bottle was visible, but it wasn’t exactly conspicuous, and honestly, it never occurred to me to “hide” it. And while it’s tragic that his mother had a relapse and became seriously ill as a result of it, it could have been even more of a tragedy for our son, outdoors alone looking for help, and that isn’t registering with him. Patricia has been extremely apologetic, but considering what happened, I don’t want her watching Harry on her own anymore. My husband says I am trying to “punish” his mother for what happened. As far as he’s concerned, it will never again be an issue since we don’t usually keep alcohol in the house. Am I going too far?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmexcbo5200173b7awyd93uhj@published"&gt;There’s too much I don’t know for me to make a ruling about whether forever banning Patricia as a sitter is “going too far.” Since she was the one you turned to in a non-emergency situation to sit for your 3-year-old, I’m guessing that she has three years of reliability and trustworthiness behind her. You’re in a much better position than I to determine whether what happened is an anomaly. (Your husband’s argument—that it won’t/can’t happen again because you won’t have alcohol in the house in the future—is specious.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmexcbo7400183b7afrfbyhzw@published"&gt;The bigger issue here, I think, is that your husband blames you for what happened. This is not a healthy or reasonable reaction. (I suspect that it’s a learned one; that rationalizing his mom’s drinking and blaming it on others was once a coping mechanism.) It’s also a problem that he is now angry with you for “punishing” his mom—as is, obviously, his failure to take seriously the jeopardy his mother put your son in.&lt;/p&gt;

If you can’t talk honestly about what happened without fighting (or talking past each other), get some help. As to having your mother-in-law babysit, I’d give it some time. In other words, for now and the immediate future, do not leave your child with her (you don’t need to make a big announcement about it; just don’t do it). See how things go. You can revisit this decision later.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmexcjdu2002c3b7a7bqmv1ml@published"&gt;Is there such a thing as taking too many pictures of your kids? My husband, who is a great father, is really fanatical about taking photos of our only child, a 3-year-old girl. He takes pictures of her CONSTANTLY. He thinks it’s important to document every day, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/12/childhood-photos-too-many-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;so he’ll take a minimum of 10 photos daily, along with a few short videos.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But her fatigue had become so overwhelming that she struggled to climb her stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 2023, Garcia weighed nearly 300 pounds, even though she could only eat a handful of food at a time. She had so much discomfort in her abdomen that she had a hard time sleeping, and started to experience numbness in her legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had tried another gynecologist, an acupuncturist and a pair of holistic healers, but none of them could help. Feeling discouraged, she decided to take a break from doctors in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Seeing her become defeated every single time, that was the most frustrating thing,” Starla Garcia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hiatus ended in the fall after Garcia started a job as a compensation professional at a tech company. The doctor at her company’s health clinic felt her stomach and decided to order a CT scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It revealed that Garcia had been carrying a 20-pound tumor in her abdomen, which was wrapped around and pushing against her colon, uterus and kidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's crazy, because she was a visiting doctor,” Garcia said of the physician who ordered the CT scan. “I never saw her again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;p data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;Jackie Garcia, left, listens to Sarah Lamarand before a book club meeting for cancer survivors at Good On Paper Books in Houston on Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Elizabeth Conley/Houston Chronicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2 class="cci_subhead" title="CCI Subhead"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A rare form of cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garcia was shocked to learn she had a tumor, but relieved it meant the end of years of unresolved questions. She made an appointment to see doctors at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors at the hospital’s Sarcoma and Orthopaedic Center confirmed the tumor was a retroperitoneal liposarcoma, a rare type of soft-tissue cancer that develops in fat cells in the space in the back of the abdomen. Liposarcomas can be difficult to detect because it’s often assumed the patient is just gaining weight, said Dr. Kelly Hunt, the chair of the department of breast surgical oncology at MD Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oftentimes, when it’s a young person like that, especially when you’re a little overweight, they’ll tell you that you need to diet and exercise,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tumor was “very, very large” and had taken up a lot of Garcia’s abdominal cavity, Hunt said. It was also the likely culprit for all of Garcia’s symptoms, because it was pushing against her organs and taking important nutrients and protein from her body to keep growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surgery to remove a liposarcoma can be complicated if the cancer has spread to or invaded surrounding organs. Surgeons sometimes need to remove organs that have been damaged, Hunt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Garcia had a low-grade liposarcoma, which is less likely to invade surrounding organs, Hunt said. Doctors were able to remove the tumor during a December 2023 surgery while minimizing the damage to surrounding organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They had initially prepped me to come out of the surgery missing one piece, or missing a couple pieces,” Garcia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;p data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;Jackie Garcia, left, shows her TikTok post with fellow cancer survivor Sarah Lamarand before a book club meeting for cancer survivors at Good On Paper Books in Houston on Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Elizabeth Conley/Houston Chronicle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2 class="cci_subhead" title="CCI Subhead"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Don’t give up on your body’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surgery dramatically improved Garcia’s day-to-day life. Removing the massive tumor relieved the discomfort in her abdomen, which allowed her to sleep through the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;She needed to wait nine months before she could start exercising because doctors worried she might develop a hernia after the major surgery. She’s also still in physical therapy for chronic pain and a misalignment in her hips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not gonna feel the way I felt before. I have hip issues and low back issues,” she said. “But I can totally feel the difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garcia also visits MD Anderson every few months for testing. The abdomen is such a large space that Garcia will need to be monitored for years in case of a recurrence, Hunt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating the cancer and recovering from the surgery was such a whirlwind that Garcia didn’t have time to reflect on everything until well after the surgery. When she finally did, she dealt with depression, but working with an adolescent and young adult cancer support group has helped her to feel better, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, Garcia decided to share the story she’d told her friends and family on TikTok. Her &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jae_so_fierce/photo/7538587514471288094" data-link="native" class=""&gt;most popular post about her cancer&lt;/a&gt; has now been viewed more than 600,000 times, so she decided to follow up with a six-part series in hopes that what she went through will inspire others to keep advocating for their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maybe you're not crazy,” she said. “Believe in your intuition, and don’t give up on your body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Houston Chronicle</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 11:16:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNRGVGRG0yWnlCYmJZcklnaU9vOVRVV1o2OWJuMlVTODM2ajVFRE00dndhR2tnZjRHeG4xcHFjdWJzVF95dzA4LVprWFU2RHh1ZmhodlRwNmFXakdfZG9HTHpVTTJNYWxkU0N5N2FZVDBCMFhiTEdodlZhNG42MHZaRjd6NkFzaXd5VjFJa2Mycldad1hhY0pyaGZuRThVMkdHQTlEOUlHdHVUQQ</guid></item><item><title>当今儿童饮食的真正问题- vox.com</title><link>https://www.vox.com/life/459495/kids-food-maha-diet-culture-virginia-sole-smith</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="zephr-anchor" class="_1agbrix10"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="/family/369020/kids-children-generation-alpha-gen-school" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kids Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Vox’s newsletter about kids, for everyone. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="/pages/kids-today-newsletter-policy-childhood-policy-culture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sign up here for future editions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Are American kids eating the wrong foods?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s a question parents and policymakers have worried over for generations, but it’s become especially fraught in recent months as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his Make American Healthy Again movement have focused national attention on rising rates of childhood chronic illness, which they say are linked to kids’ diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some MAHA dietary claims — about the dangers of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/well/eat/seed-oil-effects.html"&gt;seed oils&lt;/a&gt;, for example — aren’t backed up by science. At the same time, researchers and experts are worried, to varying degrees, about &lt;a href="/future-perfect/402470/ultra-processed-foods-labels-fda-maha"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; in kids’ diets, and about rising rates of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/08/nx-s1-5459910/kids-health-children-chronic-disease"&gt;childhood obesity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I’ve long been persuaded by research showing that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/11/well/eat/dieting-weight-loss.html"&gt;diets don’t work&lt;/a&gt; and that &lt;a href="/life/396193/red-dye-3-40-foods-fda-bans-kids"&gt;restricting kids’ food isn’t healthy&lt;/a&gt; for them. At the same time, I’m often unsure how to talk about kids and food in a time of both growing concern and growing misinformation about children’s health. How can parents and policymakers today do right by kids in a way that goes beyond obsessively checking food labels?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For help with this question, I turned to Virginia Sole-Smith, whose work I’ve followed ever since she chronicled &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/magazine/when-your-baby-wont-eat.html"&gt;her baby’s struggle to eat&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Times. Sole-Smith has a hard-won understanding of the fact that every kid’s needs are different, and that what may seem like harmless advice for feeding children can be unhelpful or even shaming. The author of the book &lt;a href="https://virginiasolesmith.com/books/fat-talk-parenting-in-the-age-of-diet-culture/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fat Talk: Parenting in the Age of Diet Culture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as well as the newsletter &lt;a href="https://virginiasolesmith.substack.com/"&gt;Burnt Toast&lt;/a&gt;, she’s one of the most vocal advocates of an anti-diet approach to feeding kids in a time when it seems we’re all supposed to be very panicked about what our children are eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In a phone conversation, which has been condensed and edited, we talked about why food matters so much to kids, how MAHA messaging trickles down to young people, and what parents should actually be worrying about when it comes to children’s diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Childhood is this time when you’re building your relationship to the world, you’re making memories, you’re exploring. Can you talk about what role food can play in that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s sort of two things to say there. One is, we as parents really want our kids to have a lot of joyful connections to food, and having food traditions and food rituals can really help kids feel grounded and connected to their family. For example, my mother makes these really great birthday cakes for my kids, and it’s just a great core memory of their childhood. Similarly, when I grow tomatoes in the backyard, my younger kiddo loves to go and just eat the Sungold tomatoes by the handful. And I’m like, &lt;em&gt;What a great childhood memory she’s making there. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;On the flip side of that is the fact that kids have very little control over their lives, how they spend their days, where they go, who they’re with. School in particular throws a ton of newness at them all the time, and they’re expected to go along with a lot of rules, and food is one of the very few things they can control. So it makes a lot of sense that kids are cautious around food, that they have extremely strong preferences around food, because this is one of the only ways they get to say no in their day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a time in American culture when adults are so, so anxious about what kids are eating. We have all these messages about ultra-processed foods, about food dyes. Are kids hearing that anxiety? Are these messages making it to them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I can remember my now-12-year-old when she was — I think this was her fourth birthday party; I was cutting up the birthday cake, and one of the kids said to me something like, &lt;em&gt;We shouldn’t eat too much of that. Sugar is not good for you&lt;/em&gt;. And I was like, &lt;em&gt;Birthday cake is really good for you because it makes us so happy&lt;/em&gt;. And she was like, &lt;em&gt;Okay, but not too much&lt;/em&gt;. And it was just like this little preschooler, clearly parroting her mom or her dad or whatever grown-up in the house was constantly worrying about their sugar intake, and it was really impacting her ability to just enjoy a birthday party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I hear thousands of examples like that from my readers, like kids come home from school and say, &lt;em&gt;Mom, we can’t eat orange foods&lt;/em&gt;. Or, you know, getting worried about being a Goldfish cracker addict is one I’ve heard recently. Because they hear the way grown-ups talk about processed food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For adults at least, it feels like we’re in a really weird spot with body image and body positivity. There’s an awareness of what diet culture is, and a sense that it’s bad, but there’s still a lot of panic around &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/future-perfect/410565/protein-muscle-gain-weightlifting-plant-based-vegan"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;what kind of foods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; we should eat. And now there’s a lot of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/culture/417063/women-muscles-strength-weight-training-casey-johnston-amy-larocca-bonnie-tsui"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;emphasis on being strong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, but we haven’t necessarily jettisoned the idea that &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/culture/415457/summer-bodies-tiktok-fitness-gym-pilates-detox-gen-z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;our bodies should look or be a certain way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. How are kids thinking about body image? How are they thinking about the concept of diet culture?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I think there’s a lot of polarization happening. On the one hand, I’m really encouraged by the way I see Gen Z on TikTok talking about bodies. There’s often a lot of pushing back against fatphobia. There’s normalization of body hair, like a lot of Gen Zs not shaving their legs or their armpits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;“When you try to solve for body size, you create a really toxic set of ripple effects around people’s relationships with food and their bodies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;On the other hand, I think there are a lot of kids who, if they’re being raised in a MAHA household, a diet-culture-intensive household, are experiencing all of those expectations. You might want to check out &lt;a href="https://virginiasolesmith.substack.com/p/the-eating-enough-myth"&gt;the piece I ran on the newsletter&lt;/a&gt; about an influencer named Breanna Cox, who posted a reel where she was weighing her protein and explaining to her 11-year-old daughter why she meal preps that way, and the video ends with her daughter being like, &lt;em&gt;Can you make me one&lt;/em&gt;? And she’s so excited that her daughter wants to meal prep with her. She really framed it as like, &lt;em&gt;This is me helping her have a healthy relationship with her body, because I’m helping her make healthy choices.&lt;/em&gt; But she was really teaching her daughter restriction tools; it was diet behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to talk about the concept of childhood obesity. It’s something RFK Jr. and his team talk about in the MAHA report, but it’s also something experts are worried about: It’s mentioned in a study of children’s chronic illness published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt; recently. How do you think about “childhood obesity” — should it be put in the same category as conditions like diabetes or asthma?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I don’t think we should be pathologizing body size. It’s clear from the data that body sizes have trended upwards in the last 40 years. That trend has happened while we have been fighting a war on childhood obesity. So I think it’s clear that obsessing over body size has not made us healthier or smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I also think the data doesn’t really support the idea that body size, per se, is a health condition. Body size might be a symptom of other health conditions; often, when people have Type 2 diabetes, weight drops dramatically or increases dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It might also be that kids today are bigger as a generation because of changes in the food supply. But that isn’t the problem I think we need to be solving. Because when you try to solve for body size, you create a really toxic set of ripple effects around people’s relationships with food and their bodies. Weight-cycling takes a tremendous toll on our bodies. So that doesn’t feel like the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We could be making school lunch and breakfast universally free and nutritious. We could be increasing food-stamp benefits to low-income families. We could be universalizing health care. There’s a lot of really obvious things we could do to make people healthier that really are all about fighting poverty and discrimination and social inequity. But when we make it all about weight, we’re really not dealing with any of those underlying issues. It’s a way of putting the blame on parents, putting the blame on kids themselves, and then stoking this whole other epidemic of disordered eating and eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something you talk about a lot in your newsletter is how diet culture affects other aspects of life. Can you explain that a little bit? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Diet culture has taught us not to trust ourselves. It’s taught us to seek an external set of rules to tell us the best way to do something, the best way to be, and it’s telling us that following these external rules is going to ensure our health and happiness. It’s about selling people a problem so you can sell them a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because I write about kids and screens a lot, I’m curious if screen time fits into this. Is screen time a diet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s a really interesting one. I think a lot of our parental attitudes towards screen time are really diet-culture-based. And I put myself firmly in that camp. I struggle with being too restrictive around screens and seeing it backfire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I really like the work of Ash Brandin, who has a book called &lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/ash-brandin/power-on/9780306836992/?lens=balance"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power On&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When we demonize screens, we make them forbidden fruit, and we set kids up and ourselves up to feel like failures. Instead, we should think about: How are screens meeting our needs? And I think there’s a really good parallel there with processed foods. Maybe processed foods are not the platonic ideal of nutrition at all times, but how are they meeting your needs? Are they helping an anxious eater eat lunch in a busy cafeteria because his lunch is really predictable and comforting because the cheeses always taste exactly the same? That’s a valuable way to make sure that kid has lunch today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Are they helping a parent who works all day get dinner on the table faster because a jar of pasta sauce is easier to use than making your own from scratch every night? That’s a win, because you have dinner on the table. There’s all these ways that processes are not the enemy of nutrition. They’re not the enemy of a good relationship with food. They’re actually serving critical needs. And if we don’t want them to be the answer, we don’t want screens to be the answer, we really need to look at all these, you know, systemic care gaps that leave families needing to rely on these tools, and not make the families feel bad that these are our answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your message to parents who are seeing — not just from MAHA but from academics and researchers as well — worries about ultra-processed foods, about childhood obesity, and who are getting the message that they need to be really careful and vigilant about what their kids eat? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What I found when I dived into the research was that the science pretty clearly shows that if kids have enough food to eat, then the minutia of nutrition works itself out. I see with my own kid; there’ll be a day where she eats nothing but cheese, and then the next day she’s living on tomatoes or cucumbers. Their eating patterns don’t look like my plate, they don’t look like what we’ve been told is the “ideal” way to feed a kid. But that doesn’t mean they’re not meeting their nutritional needs. Bodies are just really idiosyncratic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What we really need to be worrying about is people having enough access to food, and kind of stripping away a lot of the other stress. Because anytime you start to make food into a power struggle with kids, you’re coming up against their need for control. You’re really telling them, &lt;em&gt;I should be the one to say what goes in your body&lt;/em&gt;, which is, I think, a really troubling message. I want my kids to be able to say no to broccoli, because I want them to know that their &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; really matters. I have daughters, and I’m thinking about future sexual situations, but across the board, we want kids to know that at their core, they have a right to body autonomy. They have a right to getting enough food to help them grow, and they have a right to some control around what that looks like. And if you do that, the nutrition piece sorts itself out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As severe weather events like hurricanes and &lt;a href="/climate/394882/wildfire-disaster-schools-kids"&gt;wildfires&lt;/a&gt; become more common, they’re &lt;a href="https://www.k12dive.com/news/severe-weather-school-finances-instruction-wildfires-hurricanes-extreme-heat/758548/"&gt;disrupting kids’ education&lt;/a&gt;.

It means…sort of nothing, and is used in part to annoy adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;My little kid has been enjoying &lt;a href="https://oliverjeffers.com/books/stuck"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stuck&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which a kite gets lodged in a tree and the situation really spirals from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Last week, I wrote about &lt;a href="/life/458630/minecraft-roblox-gaming-kids-gen-alpha-culture-millennials"&gt;Gen Alpha popular culture&lt;/a&gt;, which can feel very fragmented and ever-shifting. One reader, however, noted that kids’ taste in books might actually be more monolithic. “I say this anecdotally from working with elementary school students, but also from articles like &lt;a href="https://www.startribune.com/heres-what-hennepin-county-library-cardholders-read-the-most-in-2024/601199436?utm_source=gift"&gt;this roundup of top 2024 library books&lt;/a&gt;, which reported that “Various titles from the Dog Man and Cat Kid Comic Club series, both by Dav Pilkey, took up all 10 spots for juvenile print books.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;My older kid is a Dog Man hater, but I’ve definitely observed the cultural dominance of the franchise. Now I’m curious what the kids in your lives are reading. Is there still a monoculture when it comes to children’s books, or are their reading tastes all over the map?

About one in 10 Americans have diabetes and, of those, the majority have type 2 diabetes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/about/about-type-2-diabetes.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/about/about-type-2-diabetes.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-node-id="2.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC). But the CDC also points out that many cases of type 2 diabetes can be prevented through lifestyle changes.

The researchers split participants into an intervention group and a control group, and then tracked their health for six years. At the start of the study, all participants were between 55 and 75, were overweight or had obesity, and had metabolic syndrome (a cluster of symptoms that raises the risk of diabetes and other health conditions) but didn’t have type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Those in the intervention group were asked to follow a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a27542959/mediterranean-diet-food-list/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a27542959/mediterranean-diet-food-list/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mediterranean diet" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, reduce their daily caloric intake by about 600 calories a day, and do regular moderate physical activity. They also got professional support for weight loss control. The control group stuck to a Mediterranean diet, but didn’t restrict calories, follow specific guidance around exercise, or receive professional support for their weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;At the study's conclusion, the researchers found that people in the intervention group had a 31 percent lower risk of develop type 2 diabetes compared to people in the control group. They also lost an average of 7.3 pounds compared to 1.3 pounds in the control group, and reduced their waist circumference by 3.6 centimeters compared to the control group’s 0.3 centimeters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-is-the-mediterranean-diet-helpful-in-lowering-diabetes-risk" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.0"&gt;How is the Mediterranean diet helpful in lowering diabetes risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Everyone in the study followed the Mediterranean diet, and it seemed to help with weight loss across the board. While losing weight can lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in people with overweight or obesity, there’s likely more to it than that, according to Jessica Cording, RD, CDN, author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=womenshealth-auto-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.65320172%5Bsrc%7Cwww.google.com%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Ce119c9e8-48b1-44bc-b29e-55697d00325f%5Baxid%7Cc59dd551-4b0d-4d0a-a77b-6584a81da220" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-product-id="3e003727-1123-4dec-947b-7fd7c35e9e68" data-node-id="13.1" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=womenshealth-auto-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.65320172%5Bsrc%7Cwww.google.com%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Ce119c9e8-48b1-44bc-b29e-55697d00325f%5Baxid%7Cc59dd551-4b0d-4d0a-a77b-6584a81da220" data-product-url="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=womenshealth-auto-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.65320172%5Bsrc%7Cwww.google.com%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Ce119c9e8-48b1-44bc-b29e-55697d00325f%5Baxid%7Cc59dd551-4b0d-4d0a-a77b-6584a81da220" data-affiliate="true" data-affiliate-url="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=womenshealth-auto-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.65320172%5Bsrc%7Cwww.google.com%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Ce119c9e8-48b1-44bc-b29e-55697d00325f%5Baxid%7Cc59dd551-4b0d-4d0a-a77b-6584a81da220" data-affiliate-network='{"site_id":"6b499c58-dc46-4f93-80b3-25265395e77a","metadata":{"links":{"default":"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=womenshealth-auto-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.65320172%5Bsrc%7Cwww.google.com%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Ce119c9e8-48b1-44bc-b29e-55697d00325f%5Baxid%7Cc59dd551-4b0d-4d0a-a77b-6584a81da220","sem":"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=wh-lift-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.65320172%5Bsrc%7Cwww.google.com%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Ce119c9e8-48b1-44bc-b29e-55697d00325f%5Baxid%7Cc59dd551-4b0d-4d0a-a77b-6584a81da220","social":"https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=wh-soc-lift-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.65320172%5Bsrc%7Cwww.google.com%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Ce119c9e8-48b1-44bc-b29e-55697d00325f%5Baxid%7Cc59dd551-4b0d-4d0a-a77b-6584a81da220"}},"network":{"name":"Amazon"},"product_metadata":null,"afflink_redirect":"/_p/afflink/xeGc/amazon-s-little-book-game-changers-managing-dp-163228068x"}' data-vars-ga-product-price="$0.00" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="e17c35b6-418f-467d-9328-8b42234aca08" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-axid="c59dd551-4b0d-4d0a-a77b-6584a81da220" data-amazon-ascsubtag="[artid|2140.a.65320172[src|www.google.com[ch|[lt|sale[pid|e119c9e8-48b1-44bc-b29e-55697d00325f[axid|c59dd551-4b0d-4d0a-a77b-6584a81da220" data-aps-asc-tag="womenshealth-auto-20" data-aps-asc-subtag="[artid|2140.a.65320172[src|www.google.com[ch|[lt|sale[pid|e119c9e8-48b1-44bc-b29e-55697d00325f[axid|c59dd551-4b0d-4d0a-a77b-6584a81da220" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=womenshealth-auto-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.65320172%5Bsrc%7Cwww.google.com%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Ce119c9e8-48b1-44bc-b29e-55697d00325f%5Baxid%7Cc59dd551-4b0d-4d0a-a77b-6584a81da220" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Little Book of Game-Changers" rel="nofollow" class="body-link product-links css-7bauu1 e1aq0z090"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="13.1.0"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="13.1.0.0"&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;"It generally is high in fiber, healthy fats, and polyphenols, all of which have been shown to play a protective role in health in various ways," she says.

But if you're looking to follow this study's "calorie reduction" rule for diabetes prevention, she suggests tweaking your existing diet to try to cut out extra calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;"An approach I've found helpful for my clients is to explore where excess calories may be coming from and take small steps to reduce there," she says. "For example, if someone is consuming a lot of extra calories through large quantities of sugary beverages, starting by switching to a smaller size and/or reducing the frequency of those beverages may be helpful." Cording also says that incorporating more foods with protein, healthy fat, and fiber may help you feel fuller, longer, and therefore less likely to take in more calories than you need. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The National Institutes of Health also has an &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/bwp" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/bwp" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="online body weight planner" data-node-id="22.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;online body weight planner&lt;/a&gt; that can help you figure out what your daily calorie count should be based on your goals, plus how many calories you should take in once you’ve reached that goal.&lt;br data-node-id="22.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-can-these-three-lifestyle-changes-work-together-to-lower-diabetes-risk" data-node-id="23" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.0"&gt;How can these three lifestyle changes work together to lower diabetes risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Diabetes is a complicated condition and, as such, usually requires a multi-pronged approach to lower your risk, according to Dr. Ali.

But here's a reality check- your protein intake needs to be sustainable, it’s not just about a few months, but about building a natural dietary habit that lasts for decades, becoming a seamless part of everyday life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/08/30/550x309/protein_1756549340110_1756549340306.jpg" alt="Try to add protein in your every meal.(Shutterstock)" title="Try to add protein in your every meal.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/08/30/550x309/protein_1756549340110_1756549340306.jpg" alt="Try to add protein in your every meal.(Shutterstock)" title="Try to add protein in your every meal.(Shutterstock)"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Try to add protein in your every meal.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/protein-idli-mix-to-cookies-nutritionist-decodes-protein-fortified-foods-and-whether-you-actually-need-them-101752311156862.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Protein idli mix to cookies: Nutritionist decodes fortified foods and whether you actually need them"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein idli mix to cookies: Nutritionist decodes fortified foods and whether you actually need them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So how do you go about it, making it a normal instinct so that you stop treating it as a chore and instead naturally include it in your daily routine?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fitness coach Raj Ganpath, who regularly shares fitness tips with his Instagram community, in an August 20 post, addressed this concern many people may have. To make regular protein intake sustainable across decades, he highlighted some strategies that simplify it over time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here are the 5 strategies Raj listed:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Every meal should have some form of protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step is to make protein a part of your regular meals, not like an addition, but fundamentally integral to the dish you have, irrespective of what you eat and where you eat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The coach added, “Make sure your every meal you eat contains some form of protein. What protein doesn't matter, how much doesn't matter- just make sure there is some form of protein in any meal that you eat.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Protein should not be skipped, and it’s important to include it in some form at every meal, wherever you are. He said, “It could be breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack at home, outside in your city, outside your city, does not matter- make sure it is a part of your meal.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Get accustomed to better protein sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is to ensure you are choosing the right sources. Raj advised identifying the right sources, depending on whether you are veg or non-veg.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He elaborated, "Identify protein sources that are actually rich in protein, based on your dietary constraints and make them a part of your day. For instance, if you are a meat eater, eggs, meat, sea food all that is great. But if you are a vegetarian, you need to eat low-fat cheeses, tofu, tempeh, soya chunks, things like that. You may not be used to it but try to identify them and include them, get used to them."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Often vegetarians, especially Indians, struggle with low protein intake as the sources are commonly thought to be pulses, but they may not be sufficient. This is why Raj stressed the fact that you need to adjust to the protein sources as per your dietary restrictions, even if foods like tempeh, tofu are new to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Protein not as a side to your main dish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you the one who includes boiled eggs alongside your main plate, holding your nose, and quickly eating them just to get it over with? If so, one reason your protein intake may fall short is that protein is treated as a side dish. The fitness coach also pointed out this issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said, "Make these protein-rich options a part of your meal, not just a side where you are force-fitting it into your meal. That means don't create a protein-free meal and then have protein on the side and think okay, I just have to somehow eat the protein, then I can enjoy my protein-free meal."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Suggesting the solution, he continued, "Instead, try and make it a part of the meal, how do you include it in the recipes, that is the only way to make a part of your life in the long term."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So instead, try adding egg or whatever protein you have as one of the ingredients, like egg bhurji with green veggies to pair with your ragi roti.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Supplement when necessary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now there are possibilities of falling behind your recommended protein intake despite diligent meal planning. Raj suggested taking a supplement to fill this gap.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said, “If you are doing the first three steps and you are still not getting enough protein, you most definitely should supplement. This is precisely why supplements exist. So don't fight it. Don't overthink it. Try to get protein from real food if you are not able to supplement wisely.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Track but don't obsess&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While tracking your protein makes you aware of the protein amount you are consuming every day, hyperfixating on it may backfire. The fitness coach warned that constantly counting every last protein gram. It will just make you paranoid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Raj said,“You should know how much protein you are getting. It is important because you are not getting enough of it, so maybe once a month or once in two months, do a breakdown and understand how much protein you are getting in grams, but don't get into the habit of counting protein grams every day.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He instead suggested including protein in every meal, adopting a structure rather than measuring the numbers all the time. And every couple of months, the daily meals' protein amount can be checked, not every other day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.
