It is unclear if the individual is a student or employee. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The lung infection tuberculosis is on the rise in the US, prompting urgent warnings from public health experts (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, Kansas health officials warned in January that the state was experiencing the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14332367/Tuberculosis-outbreak-Kansas.html"&gt;'the largest documented outbreak in US history&lt;/a&gt;,' with 67 people infected with active TB since the start of 2024, according to the latest figures. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Raj Dasgupta, internal medicine physician and Chief Medical Advisor for Sleepopolis, told the Daily Mail: 'Without strong public-health action, we’ll probably continue to see elevated numbers.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Children, older adults and those with weaker immune systems are more vulnerable to the infection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the lung infection doesn't always cause symptoms (then called inactive TB), about half of people with untreated active infections will die.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the early stages, symptoms include a persistent and unexplained cough, sometimes coughing up blood or chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients may also suffer from unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, fever and night sweats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In later stages, patients may have severe breathing difficulties and extensive lung damage, and the infection may spread to other organs or the back, causing pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deaths are most often due to respiratory failure caused by bacterial damage to the lungs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Medical advancements like antibiotics have helped dramatically curb deaths.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once killing as many as 20,000 Americans each year in the 1950s, according to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), deaths have declined to about 560 per year as of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB was on a steady decline from 1993 until 2020, when the overall number of cases hit an all-time low of 7,170. But in 2021, that number jumped to 7,866.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prevalence has gone up every year since. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest CDC data shows the US provisionally recorded 10,347 TB cases in 2024 - up eight percent from the year before and the highest tally since 2011, when there were 10,471 cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above are public health posters from the Work Projects Administration in the 1930s and '40s on getting tested for tuberculosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to 2014, cases nationwide are up 10 percent, CDC data shows.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And experts have warned it is not just one area responsible for the increase. According to the data, TB infections are on the rise in 40 US states and have only declined in 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The District of Columbia is the only jurisdiction to report no change compared to 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maine has reported 28 cases so far this year compared to 39 during all of 2024, which showed a 179 percent increase from the 14 cases in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB cases have risen the most - 187 percent - in Kansas compared to a decade ago. Maine has seen a rise of 179 percent from 2014 to 2024 (14 compared to 39, respectively), while North Carolina reported 250 cases last year compared to 195 in 2014 - a 22 percent increase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;California reported the most cases in both 2014 (2,145) and 2024 (2,100), and Texas had the second most with 1,269 in 2014 and 1,238 in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In New York, the state with the third-highest prevalence, cases have surged 73 percent over the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Across Idaho, Vermont and Wyoming, cases are up 100 percent compared to 2014. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors and public health experts told the Daily Mail that the Covid pandemic is likely a main driver in TB's surge, especially considering cases started going up in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In my opinion, early in the pandemic, a lot of clinics focused almost entirely on Covid, which meant TB testing and treatment often got pushed aside,' Dasgupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At the same time, masks and social distancing probably helped slow TB spread for a while. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now that most people aren’t masking, and with those earlier delays in diagnosis, we’re seeing cases rise again.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria, which cause tuberculosis, are pictured above (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pandemic also forged a growing distrust of doctors and the medical establishment, which Dr Sharon Nachman, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Stony Brook Children's Hospital, said has likely contributed to the rise of TB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One JAMA study found the public's general trust in physicians and hospitals dropped from 71.5 percent in April 2020 to 40 percent in January 2024. Experts have suggested the change is likely due to concerns over vaccine mandates and Big Pharma's financial gains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nachman told the Daily Mail: 'I believe the erosion of public health funding and the publicity around "medical myths" being true has led to people not seeing their medical providers and not following standard guidelines or even going back for follow-up care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This translates into poor care for our population and delays in preventing TB infection from progressing to TB disease (meaning intrathoracic or lung disease).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This delay then translates into a person having an easily treatable infection to having a disease that transmits to their family and friends, leading to more cases of TB.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The demographics of TB began to shift in 2001. That was the first year the CDC reported more non-US born citizen patients than US-born, meaning immigrants and travelers were the driving force behind infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dasgupta said international travel and migration play a role as many of those cases were linked to folks who had recently come from places where TB is more common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is a chest X-ray showing signs of tuberculosis. Doctors told the Daily Mail that paying attention to early symptoms is key for preventing spread (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;International travel further surged starting around 2021, after the height of the Covid pandemic, which Nachman said could have further driven the increase as Americans ventured abroad and foreign relatives made Stateside visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The longer you stay and come into contact with an infected adult, the more likely you are to get infected yourself,' Nachman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, infections are linked to significant, long-term exposure over months or years, so one international trip abroad likely is not enough to bring TB back to the states, she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tuberculosis can be prevented with the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. Though, due to the generally low risk, it is not routinely offered in the US - except for to children regularly exposed to people with active TB or healthcare workers in areas with increased spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It’s not recommended here because of its variable effectiveness against adult pulmonary TB and because it can interfere with TB skin test results,' Dasgupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In developing countries, the vaccine is administered to children younger than 16. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As cases rise, Dasgupta urged Americans to 'pay attention to symptoms' before they progress so antibiotics can be administered and potential spread can slow.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you’ve had a cough for more than a couple weeks, or unexplained weight loss, fevers, or night sweats, get checked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And if you are diagnosed, stick with treatment until the end. Stopping early can lead to drug resistance.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found that one key health reading taken at the age of 7 could have a significant impact on the risk of dying of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-heart-is-vulnerable-these-4-things-will-help-you-protect-it"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; (CVD) decades later: blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study carried out by researchers from institutions across the US, children with elevated blood pressure (in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile"&gt;90 to 94th percentile&lt;/a&gt;) or hypertension (in the 95th percentile or above) were some 40 to 50 percent more likely to meet an early death because of CVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were surprised to find that high blood pressure in childhood was linked to serious health conditions many years later," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/higher-blood-pressure-in-childhood-linked-to-earlier-death-from-heart-disease-in-adulthood"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Alexa Freedman, from Northwestern University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-daily-habit-could-help-lower-your-blood-pressure"&gt;A Simple Daily Habit Could Help Lower Your Blood Pressure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's a big jump in risk, but it's helpful to put these figures into some context. The researchers analyzed medical data collected on 37,081 children born in the US between 1959 and 1965, including a reading of their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-how-much-exercise-you-need-weekly-to-control-your-blood-pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; at age 7. A follow-up survey was conducted decades later, in their early fifties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of the tens of thousands of individuals in the sample, nearly 500 died of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-gram-of-salt-is-the-difference-for-millions-of-heart-attacks"&gt;cardiovascular diseases&lt;/a&gt;, including a number without high blood pressure, so we're not talking about huge numbers overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood pressure was only measured once at age 7 rather than being monitored throughout the lives of the participants, further limiting the reliability of any conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173638" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173638" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/HeartChart.jpg" alt="Heart health chart" class="wp-image-173638 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/HeartChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/HeartChart-582x415.jpg 582w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/HeartChart-600x428.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173638" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers charted heart-related deaths against blood pressure. The blue line represents typical blood pressure, the orange line represents elevated blood pressure, and the black line represents hypertension. (Freedman et al., &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the increase in mortality risk is notable enough to make the findings worthy of future investigation, highlighting the importance of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-heart-drug-taken-by-millions-may-often-be-useless-or-even-risky"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt; even at a very young age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"High blood pressure in children can have serious consequences throughout their lives," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/higher-blood-pressure-in-childhood-linked-to-earlier-death-from-heart-disease-in-adulthood"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Freedman. "It is crucial to be aware of your child's blood pressure readings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A host of factors contribute to CVD, so it's worth noting that 359 of the individuals studied were from families that had multiple children involved in the research. The results among children with the same family background were similar to the overall figures, suggesting that blood pressure is key &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/research-shows-one-easy-diet-swap-can-reduce-blood-pressure-and-heart-attacks"&gt;rather than diet&lt;/a&gt; or living environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies could take into account additional influences on CVD risk, such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/poor-oral-hygiene-could-be-taking-a-toll-on-your-heart-expert-says"&gt;oral hygiene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-depressions-genetic-link-to-heart-disease-in-women"&gt;genetic factors&lt;/a&gt;, investigating factors that might have an early impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blood pressure data for this study had been gathered in the 1950s and 1960s – children today likely face different pressures in terms of their health and well-being. Studies have shown that exercise, diet, and stress &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/7-things-you-can-do-right-now-to-reduce-your-risk-of-high-blood-pressure"&gt;can all play a part&lt;/a&gt; in blood pressure readings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are presented in a research letter, which provides a very brief summary of the study. However, it highlights another strong link between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chronic-conditions-in-children-have-surged-dramatically-in-20-years"&gt;childhood health&lt;/a&gt; and adult health, which gives us opportunities to get good health and habits in place early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as heightening the risk of CVD, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/us-has-new-guidelines-for-high-blood-pressure-heres-what-that-means"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; has been linked to kidney disease, vision loss, sexual dysfunction, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, where potentially harmful plaque builds up in the arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results highlight the importance of screening for blood pressure in childhood and focusing on strategies to promote optimal cardiovascular health beginning in childhood," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/higher-blood-pressure-in-childhood-linked-to-earlier-death-from-heart-disease-in-adulthood?preview=bde4&amp;amp;preview_mode=True"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Freedman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research abstract has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.14405"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not all body fat is the same—and the one you really need to pay attention to is visceral fat. “Visceral fat is the fat that’s stored deep inside your abdomen, surrounding your organs like your liver, stomach and intestines,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/about-1" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike subcutaneous fat, which lies just beneath the skin, visceral fat isn’t visible—but it poses greater health risks, including a higher likelihood of heart disease and type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news? Visceral fat responds well to lifestyle changes like diet and exercise.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The bad news? There’s no quick fix to magically melt it away overnight. That said, there are foods and beverages that may &lt;em&gt;support&lt;/em&gt; visceral fat loss, such as tea. When we asked dietitians which tea is best to help lose visceral fat, their answer was unanimous: green tea. Keep reading to learn the science behind green tea and how it may support visceral fat loss.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Addressing metabolic syndrome is crucial for your health, and often involves reducing visceral fat. Fortunately, some research suggests that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-tea-for-metabolic-syndrome-8782901" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;drinking green tea may support its management&lt;/a&gt;. Green tea contains catechins, including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which may improve insulin sensitivity and reduce LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and blood pressure. As metabolic syndrome improves, the body’s ability to mobilize and burn visceral fat also increases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although promising, not all research shows a strong link between green tea consumption and improvements in metabolic syndrome, so more studies are needed. Still, given its beneficial properties, regularly drinking it is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/drink-to-limit-to-live-longer-11708703" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthier alternative to sugary beverages&lt;/a&gt; or energy drinks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Support Weight Loss &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-drink-for-weight-loss-11746010" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;green tea and weight loss&lt;/a&gt; often examines overall body fat rather than visceral fat specifically. However, some evidence suggests that components of green tea—especially catechins and caffeine—may help reduce fat around the midsection, where visceral fat is more concentrated, explains &lt;a href="https://sproutoutloud.com/about/#meet-ali" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ali McGowan, M.S., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Green tea contains compounds called catechins, which may help improve how your body uses energy,” she adds. It’s thought that these compounds can affect fat metabolism, contributing to weight loss. For instance, some observational research suggests people who regularly drink green tea alongside other healthy lifestyle habits tend to see greater &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-lose-body-fat-8619424" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;total fat loss&lt;/a&gt; compared to non-tea drinkers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Beyond this,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;most other&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;studies focus on green tea extract—a highly concentrated source of catechins—rather than the brewed beverage, making it difficult to know the true effects of drinking green tea on weight loss and whether these effects would be clinically meaningful.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, while it’s uncertain if green tea—particularly the brewed variety—directly promotes visceral fat loss, it may support fat loss by reducing calorie intake. If you typically drink calorie-dense, sugary drinks, swapping them for green tea can be an easy way to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291208/7-day-sugar-detox-meal-plan-1500-calories/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cut calories and sugar&lt;/a&gt;, which could support a calorie deficit needed for weight loss.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Lower Inflammation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Multiple factors, including visceral fat and body weight, can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;drive inflammation in the body&lt;/a&gt;, which plays a role in the development of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Green tea catechins, such as EGCG, may help counter this process by boosting antioxidant levels in the body, McGowan explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, one study found that consuming 1 to 4 cups of green tea daily was linked with a decreased risk of heart disease, which the authors attributed to green tea’s anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Green tea’s potential role in reducing visceral fat may add to this benefit, since visceral fat is metabolically active and releases pro-inflammatory molecules. In turn, reducing visceral fat can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/80991/10-ways-to-reduce-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;improve inflammatory markers&lt;/a&gt; tied to metabolic syndrome and other chronic conditions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Reduce Insulin Resistance &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Insulin resistance occurs when the body’s cells become less sensitive to insulin, the hormone that helps move glucose into cells for energy. Although many factors contribute, excess visceral fat plays a major role. In visceral fat tissue, insulin resistance disrupts normal glucose removal and promotes chronic, low-grade inflammation, leading to abnormal fat distribution and impaired metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately, green tea consumption may counter these effects. One meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in individuals with type 2 diabetes found that green tea consumption improved fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c and HOMA-IR levels—a marker of insulin resistance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; By &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lifestyle-tweaks-healthy-blood-sugar-levels-11792895" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supporting blood sugar regulation&lt;/a&gt; and lowering inflammation, green tea may improve overall metabolic health, including the management of visceral fat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-to-lose-visceral-fat"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Strategies to Lose Visceral Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although green tea may help support visceral fat loss, the most effective approach is a balanced lifestyle rather than relying on one food, nutrient or activity. Here are some other strategies to help lose visceral fat:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strength-Train.&lt;/strong&gt; Strength training helps your body build muscle, which supports a healthy metabolism and body composition.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Having more muscle mass can slightly increase resting energy expenditure. “Over time, this makes it easier to tap into stored fat, including the deeper fat around your organs,” says McGowan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do Cardio. &lt;/strong&gt;Cardio exercise not only supports a healthy cardiovascular system, but it has also been linked to meaningful weight and fat loss. Combining this with strength training provides a well-rounded approach to fitness.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat Enough Protein.&lt;/strong&gt; Consuming enough protein promotes muscle growth and keeps you full, which can support a healthy body composition and prevent overeating. Some research has also linked high-protein diets with a reduction in visceral fat, though higher-quality studies are still needed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Enough Sleep.&lt;/strong&gt; “Poor sleep can increase stress hormones like cortisol, which may encourage visceral fat storage,” notes Manaker. Additionally, inadequate sleep can affect appetite, which may lead to poorer food choices and contribute to the accumulation of visceral fat over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Stress.&lt;/strong&gt; Stress-management techniques, such as journaling, movement, deep breathing, yoga and meditation, may contribute to reducing visceral fat. “Chronic stress may lead to higher cortisol levels, which are linked to visceral fat,” explains Manaker.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skip the Added Sugar.&lt;/strong&gt; Green tea is a great beverage choice, but adding excess sugar to it may negate some of its health benefits, warns Manaker. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit or Avoid Alcohol. &lt;/strong&gt;Drinking alcohol too often or in excess is associated with greater visceral fat storage and poorer metabolic health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no single magic fix to melting away visceral fat, but adding green tea to your daily routine may give you an extra edge. Thanks to its antioxidant-rich compounds, green tea shows promise in supporting metabolic health, including improving insulin resistance and reducing visceral fat—though more research is needed to confirm its exact role. The good news? Green tea is a safe, health-supporting beverage that most people can enjoy daily. When paired with a well-rounded lifestyle, this can be a great tool to help reduce visceral fat.&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Elissa Kalver was 34 when she found a lump in her breast. She had no family history of cancer and had just welcomed her first child. She assumed the lump was a cyst. But when she went to get it checked out, doctors found another lump in her armpit. Biopsies found that both lumps were malignant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More tests found the situation was worse than she could have imagined: a PET scan found cancer in her lower spine and liver. She was diagnosed with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Diseases that have spread as far as Kalver's are considered incurable, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/25213-her2-positive-breast-cancer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was told I wasn't going to die tomorrow, but I was told that there was an 80% chance that I would die within five years," Kalver said. "The first oncologist I had, to uplift me, was like, 'Well, I have some patients who are six, seven years out.' Hearing that, as a 34-year-old, that your hope is to live till 40, was crazy." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new mom had to quickly adjust to her new reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"In my head, I was like, I know other people who have gone through this, I'll cut off my breasts, whatever we have to do to get rid of it," Kalver, now 38, said. "And it was after the PET scan, I understood that I didn't understand. It really shifted to trying to understand that I'm essentially a cancer patient for the rest of my life." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer is an aggressive and fast-growing form of breast cancer that is considered incurable but treatable. Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer have high levels of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or HER2, a protein that manages how cells grow and divide, according to the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prognosis and treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer vary depending on when it is diagnosed and the spread of the disease at the time. Patients who are diagnosed before the cancer spreads have a 97% five-year survival rate. For patients like Kalver, the five-year survival rate drops to 39%, according to the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical advances are continually improving the prognosis, according to Dr. Shari Goldfarb, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who leads the hospital's Young Women with Breast Cancer center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over the past 10 to 15 years, we've developed so many new medications that target the HER2 receptor, and that significantly improves the outcome of women diagnosed with HER2-positive disease. It used to be one of the worst and most aggressive subtypes of cancer," Goldfarb said. "Many women are living years and even decades now with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer." &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Treating HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating the disease requires constant surveillance, Goldfarb said. A patient like Kalver gets scans every three to four months. If their cancer is stable or improving, they will continue their current treatment. If the disease is progressing, the treatment would need to be changed, Goldfarb said. Doctors also need to consider a patient's quality of life and treatment side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Generally, the principle is to give people the best quality of life possible for as long as possible," Goldfarb said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kalver sought treatment at the UCLA Health Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center. Her first treatment was an aggressive course of chemotherapy. Over the past four years, she has participated in multiple clinical trials and undergone several different forms of treatment, according to her oncologist, Dr. Marla Lipsyc-Sharf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year after her diagnosis, doctors found the cancer had spread to Kalver's brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I always thought tumors in your brain, like, 'That's it,'" Kalver said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a targeted chemotherapy that crossed the blood-brain barrier to attack the tumors. The masses were reduced by about 80%, Kalver said, and they have not grown in the past three years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatments have taken their toll, Kalver said. One chemotherapy made her so nauseous that "it was hard to be awake," Kalver said. Another caused her to lose her hair, which Kalver worried would alarm her then 1-year-old daughter. Sharf said other treatments caused Kalver to experience symptoms including bone pain, muscle pain and a bleeding rash. Each time the side effects have become too intense, Sharf works to recalibrate Kalver's treatment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, Kalver is receiving chemotherapy infusions every three weeks and takes an oral medication twice a day. The treatment caused her to become "a bit anemic," which recently required a blood transfusion, but otherwise, things are going well, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After being on chemo for four years, I've really learned that we have to prioritize living, not just surviving," Kalver said. "I feel really grateful to still be on chemo treatments that work." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;"Living like I'm alive"  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kalver may spend the rest of her life on chemotherapy or other treatments. She, and many other HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients, may never enter a remission or see no evidence of disease on their scans. She did ring the bell after finishing her first course of chemotherapy, taking part in a ritual many cancer patients use to mark the end of their treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought about it a lot going into it, because I was like, 'I'm not done with treatment, but I'm done with this treatment. And this treatment was pretty hard, and I deserve to ring that bell,'" Kalver recalled. "I rang it so hard that I actually broke the bell." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, Kalver has developed other ways to mark important milestones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, she celebrates what she calls a "cancerversary," honoring the day she was diagnosed. For her first "cancerversary," Kalver launched "We Got This," the first nonprofit gift registry for cancer patients. Since then, she has written a book, become a professional speaker and worked to educate other patients about the reality of participating in clinical trials. In July, Kalver will celebrate her fifth "cancerversary." She's still mulling over how to celebrate the "big milestone." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she's not busy with work and advocacy, she spends time with her daughter, now 4, and her husband. Living life to the fullest is a priority, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I want to live as long as I can with the best quality of life that I can, making the biggest impact that I can," Kalver said.

She had tested positive for Chagas disease, which is caused by a parasite spread by triatomine bugs, otherwise known as kissing bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Neither Luna nor Valerie had heard about the disease, which is most common in rural parts of Mexico and Central and South America, where their family had traveled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If you get a letter that tells you, you have blood cancer, you know what it is. But when you receive a letter and you hear, ‘Oh, your daughter has Chagas,’ … you’re like, oh, what is this?” said Valerie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Norman Beatty, who has studied the kissing bugs, said that like Valerie and Luna, most people in the US have not heard of Chagas, even though it is not just present south of the border but within the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Beatty, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Florida College of Medicine, is part of a group of scientists that authored a new report arguing that the United States should treat Chagas as an endemic disease, meaning that there is a constant or usual prevalence of a disease or infectious agent in a population within a geographic area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They hope to increase public awareness of Chagas, which while rare, can cause serious health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“My hope is that with more awareness of Chagas, we can build a better infrastructure around helping others understand whether or not they are at risk of this disease” and cause people to think about it similarly to other vector-borne illnesses, like from mosquitoes and ticks, said Beatty. “We need to add kissing bugs to this list.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Bugs spread the parasite through their droppings, which can infect humans if they enter the body through a cut or via the eyes or mouth, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue and eyelid swelling in the weeks or months after infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some people, like Luna, do not develop any symptoms – at least initially – but about 20 to 30% of people infected can develop chronic issues later in life such as an enlarged heart and heart failure, or an enlarged esophagus or colon, leading to trouble eating or going to the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;About 8 million people, including 280,000 in the United States, have the disease, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is not a recent arrival to the US. The 1,200-year-old remains of a man buried in south Texas revealed that he had Chagas and an abnormally-enlarged colon, according to a report in the &lt;a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(10)01160-1/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Gastroenterology journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;More recently, human development in new areas has brought us “closer to the kissing bugs’ natural environment”, Beatty said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People in at least eight states have been infected with Chagas from local bugs, according to the new report, which was published in the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Emerging Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt; journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But the fact that it has not been declared endemic to the United States has led to “low awareness and underreporting”, the report states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2953998/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2010 survey&lt;/a&gt; conducted of some American Medical Association providers found that 19% of infectious disease doctors had never heard of Chagas and 27% said they were “not at all confident,” in their knowledge of the disease being up to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If you ask physicians about Chagas, they would think that it is either something transmitted by ticks … or they would say that’s something that doesn’t exist in the US,” said Dr Bernardo Moreno Peniche, a physician and anthropologist who was one of the authors of the report with Beatty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But Beatty sees people with Chagas every week at a clinic in Florida dedicated to travel medicine and tropical diseases. (Those patients were infected with Chagas in Latin America.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Beatty said there is a misconception that tests for Chagas are not reliable or available in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We have the infrastructure to start screening people who have had exposure to these bugs and who may be in a region where we had known transmission, so we should be thinking about this as kind of routine care,” Beatty said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After Valerie received the letter about Luna’s infection, she contacted her pediatrician who quickly responded and told them to see an infectious disease doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That physician told them it was likely a “false positive” and ordered additional tests before eventually starting treatment, Valerie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Frustrated by the medical care, Valerie sought out a new physician and found Beatty, who prescribed a different anti-parasitic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even among people like Luna who are not experiencing any symptoms, such treatment is often recommended, Beatty said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The goal is to “detect early and treat early to avoid the chronic, often permanent damage that can occur”, Beatty explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The treatment took two months, during which Luna experienced side effects like hives and severe swelling in her hands and feet, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While she is finished with the treatment, there is no definitive test to determine whether such patients will develop chronic Chagas symptoms, but it’s less likely, Beatty said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I hope the CDC takes it seriously,” Valerie said, “and that we can move forward and have good awareness, so that people want to be tested and get tested and get the treatment they need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 11:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9SdEFzUm12RDhGSGJKR2d5TE1KbkxGbE8wVDVGeWI4ak5rZmEwR0FlakVHT1llN3UwZmNxTndqclJtbXByZlFvUmJRTVF4ZHlMeXZWUlFsVnljcHF3c0Y1eTNCVVpVeS1oODFpdEdiQTl4R3BTckc1TjRDNE5QX2c</guid></item><item><title>正在尝试立即接种新冠肺炎疫苗？以下是须知事项-美国国家公共广播电台</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/09/13/nx-s1-5540088/covid-vaccine-2025-cdc-fda-guidelines</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                People seeking this year's COVID booster shot may find it more difficult than the past.

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;span class="credit" aria-label="Image credit"&gt;
        
        Francine Orr/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images
        
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;If you want a COVID shot, it can be frustrating to try to get one right now.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's because the Food and Drug Administration has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5515503/fda-covid-vaccines-restricted" target="_blank"&gt;narrowed its approval&lt;/a&gt; for this year's shots to only certain groups: those 65 and older, and people at high risk for developing severe illness from the virus. It's a major departure from policy in past years, when the vaccines had been approved for anyone 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Trump administration health officials argue that most otherwise healthy, younger people have so much immunity that they don't necessarily need annual boosters anymore. But many &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2025/fdas-narrow-covid-19-vaccine-label-ignores-science-and-puts-millions-of-lives-at-risk/" target="_blank"&gt;doctors' groups&lt;/a&gt; say it's a good idea to get one to avoid serious illness or spreading it to others who may be high-risk.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;So the change means you may have to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/11/nx-s1-5538105/covid-vaccine-shots-pharmacy-fda" target="_blank"&gt;work harder&lt;/a&gt; to get a shot. In the past, you could just walk into a pharmacy and ask for one. But now, you might get turned away if you don't meet those criteria.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here's what to know about getting a shot right now.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Q. If the pharmacist says I'm not eligible, do I have any options?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A: Yes. If you have one of the risk factors you may be able to "self-attest" that you're eligible. That means simply telling the pharmacist that you have a risk factor or indicating your risk factor when scheduling a shot. Often no documentation is required.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At the moment, some pharmacies may say you need to get a doctor to issue you a prescription for a shot. That requirement may go away in some states after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issues specific recommendations for who should get vaccinated. The CDC advisory committee that makes those recommendations is scheduled to meet Sept. 18-19.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Q. How do I know if I am at risk -- what conditions might make me eligible?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A: The CDC lists risk factors for the public &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/covid/risk-factors/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and for health care providers &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. They include people who are 65 and older, people from a racial or ethnic minority and people who have disabilities. There's also a broad list of conditions, including:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asthma&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cancer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cerebrovascular disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic kidney disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic lung disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic liver disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cystic fibrosis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diabetes (both types)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disabilities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart conditions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HIV&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mental health conditions – including depression&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neurologic conditions (Dementia and Parkinson's disease)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obesity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Physical inactivity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Primary immunodeficiencies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking (even if you quit)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Solid organ or blood stem cell transplantation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tuberculosis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" target="_blank"&gt;FDA estimates&lt;/a&gt; between 100 million and 200 million Americans would qualify.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Q. What if I'm pregnant?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A: Pregnancy is also named as a risk factor, even though the CDC agency dropped the recommendation that pregnant women routinely get vaccinated. The discrepancy is causing some confusion about whether pharmacists can administer the shots and insurers will pay for vaccination. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv" target="_blank"&gt;does recommend&lt;/a&gt; the shot during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Q. What about children — can they get it?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A: Yes, the COVID vaccine has been approved for children — but this year it's only for those with risk factors for serious complications. And for the first time, only one vaccine, Moderna's, has been approved for children as young as six months old. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is approved for children 5 and older. Novavax's vaccine has been approved for children as young as age 12.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Parents may need to get a prescription if they want to vaccinate otherwise healthy children. And no vaccine has been approved for younger children, such as newborn babies, even though very young children are among those most vulnerable to getting seriously ill from COVID. That's one reason why doctors recommend pregnant women get vaccinated — to pass protective antibodies to babies in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Q. Some pharmacies don't seem to have them — where can I find the shots? &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A: This year's vaccines have started to become available at many pharmacies, doctor's offices, clinics and hospitals, but some locations may not have received their orders yet but should soon. The vaccine manufacturers say they are producing plenty of vaccine, so supply shouldn't be an issue even with the narrower FDA approvals.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But some doctors that stocked the vaccine in the past may pass this time if they don't think there will be enough demand. That means you may need to go to a pharmacy to get a shot.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Pharmacy chains like &lt;a href="https://www.cvs.com/immunizations/covid-19-vaccine?icid=search_typeahead" target="_blank"&gt;CVS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.walgreens.com/topic/promotion/covid-vaccine.jsp?ban=immhub_covidvax" target="_blank"&gt;Walgreens&lt;/a&gt; have websites where people can find a vaccine and schedule appointments. Pfizer and &lt;a href="https://products.modernatx.com/finder" target="_blank"&gt;Moderna &lt;/a&gt;both opened &lt;a href="https://www.vaxassist.com/schedule?cmp=188442362390&amp;amp;utm_source=GOOGLE&amp;amp;utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;amp;pid=Scheduler&amp;amp;utm_term=pfizer%20vaccine%20available%20near%20me&amp;amp;network=g&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22943851190&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAABK5w6FawaR8GMs9_iPQ0cImTHd-Y&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw5onGBhDeARIsAFK6QJYqqC3A_jZAbNDWf_hifoXY60dX6YR_LiYEEicIdMfLaYWnOJpbL7gaAruoEALw_wcB" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine-finder websites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Q. Even if I can find a pharmacy that has the shots, will my insurance cover it? &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A: That's unclear. Insurance companies are only required to pay for the shots if they have been recommended by the CDC. That won't happen until next week at the earliest. But some insurance companies say they are covering the shots anyway, so it's worth asking if your plan covers it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;About half of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the children in the U.S. are eligible for free vaccines through the federal government's Vaccines for Children Program but the COVID shots won't be included in that until after the CDC recommendations go into effect, and even then, it may depend on the child's health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For those who have to pay out of pocket, the shots cost between $150 and $200.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Q. The CDC's advisory committee is meeting soon about the COVID shots — will that make it easier or harder to get a shot?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A: The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine advisory group&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled to meet Sept. 18-19 and is expected to issue specific recommendations for who should receive the shots, which then need to be accepted by the CDC director. The recommendations have several important effects, including allowing pharmacists in more states to administer the vaccines and making them available for free through the federal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccines for Children Program&lt;/a&gt;. So the shots could become more easily available after the recommendations — or less so — depending on what the committee recommends and what the CDC director accepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            The United States has suspended some funding for its flagship AIDS relief program, according to international organizations and members of Congress who warn the cuts are already hurting patients and halting critical projects globally.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmff38e5w000e3b6n1usu34pp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The full extent of the budget cuts related to US-funded HIV/AIDS relief work is highly unclear, and Congress is still battling the White House’s proposed budget clawbacks and withholding of billions of dollars in funding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmff38e5w000f3b6nx0ezk5sk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            PEPFAR, formally called the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, is credited with saving more than 26 million lives over the past two decades and preventing millions of HIV infections, particularly in Africa.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmff38e5w000g3b6nec8zekxz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last year alone, government figures show that PEPFAR provided 20.6 million people with life-saving HIV medicines, called antiretroviral therapy. It also supported more than 342,000 health workers to deliver HIV treatments, prevention care and support services, bolstering healthcare systems in &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/pepfar-global-aids/pepfar" target="_blank"&gt;more than 50 countries&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmff38e5w000h3b6npti4mkmz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Funding for the landmark program – established in 2003 by the Bush administration – was primarily implemented by USAID, which US President Donald Trump dismantled earlier this year after a freeze on foreign aid. The US State Department later issued a waiver to exempt life-saving services from that freeze, including those of PEPFAR, and moved operations to the State Department’s remit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmff38e5x000i3b6nfmh68hki@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But nonprofits are sounding the alarm that HIV/AIDS projects have been terminated regardless. And without USAID, implementation of many planned initiatives has also stalled. Such cuts are severely disrupting patients’ medical care across Africa, Asia and Latin America, threatening the global fight against the disease, they say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            UNAIDS, the United Nations’ agency working to end AIDS, has cited examples around the world of medicine stockouts, staffing cuts at HIV/AIDS clinics, suspended community outreach services and “rising levels of stigma, discrimination and mortality rates” in the wake of the &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2025/may/20250512_community-led-services" target="_blank"&gt;US funding cuts&lt;/a&gt;.

            The suspensions have caused major disruptions to HIV responses in dozens of countries, including &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2025/july/20250718_uganda" target="_blank"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2025/july/20250721_philippines" target="_blank"&gt;the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2025/may/20250505_people-who-use-drugs" target="_blank"&gt;Tanzania,&lt;/a&gt; the UN agency said.

            People living with HIV are skipping and rationing doses of antiretroviral medications, creating conditions for drug-resistant HIV strains to emerge, according to the nonprofit Physicians for Human Rights, which compiled &lt;a href="https://phr.org/news/trump-administration-disruptions-to-global-hiv-efforts-have-caused-severe-harms-but-congress-can-still-preserve-live-saving-programs-new-phr-research/" target="_blank"&gt;testimonies&lt;/a&gt; of healthcare disruptions from people in Tanzania and Uganda.

            &lt;a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/how-hiv-funding-cuts-are-undermining-years-progress-zimbabwe" target="_blank"&gt;Doctors Without Borders&lt;/a&gt; has warned that “PEPFAR faces an uncertain future” and that project cancellations following the dismantling of USAID have already impacted humanitarian work.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmff38e5x000o3b6nfk87uj9q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “PEPFAR’s scope of work has already been dramatically reduced since January when the State Department restricted its work on key areas of HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support,” the Doctors Without Borders statement said, contradicting the US government’s repeated claims that lifesaving aid work is being preserved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmff38e5x000p3b6n4r9gr3rn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Cuts are not just hitting program activities and medical stocks; they are crippling the logistical backbone of HIV care. Transport for distributing supplies has all but vanished,” said the organization’s representative in Zimbabwe, Zahra Zeggani-Bec.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            World Vision, an international Christian organization focusing on poverty and development, told CNN it had a large PEPFAR program in Kenya that had been terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmff38e5x000r3b6nj6zaq2am@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That (program) had focused primarily on orphans and vulnerable children and prevention activities,” said Margaret Schuler, World Vision’s chief impact officer. Shuler said it was surprising that “what would have been considered ‘lifesaving programs’ were terminated,” including other World Vision programs related to health care and disease control.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            PEPFAR reporting data has been publicly unavailable for months, meaning there’s little clarity on the program’s ongoing activities. A &lt;a href="https://data.pepfar.gov/?_gl=1*s1iv85*_gcl_au*NDcyMjk2NTA1LjE3NTY0ODEzMTM." target="_blank"&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; on the government website says it is “undergoing updates.” The release dates for 2025 PEPFAR data reports are all listed as “TBD.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            A State Department spokesperson told CNN that “data collection is ongoing to capture recent updates to programming.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmff38e5x000v3b6nt6b1zv30@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            UNAIDS said in a report in April that, among 70 of its country offices, 28 (40%) had witnessed an end to community-led services due to the US funding cuts. Meanwhile, 21 (30%) reported that services by international NGOs had been stopped.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Some of that work may have resumed, but it’s impossible to determine how much, given the lack of data on the budget, contracted services and “what has actually been delivered,” said Charles Kenny, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, a think tank based in the US and UK.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmff38e5x000x3b6nnlzh3cpm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He wrote in an &lt;a href="https://www.cgdev.org/blog/theres-lot-we-dont-know-about-status-us-assistance-delivery-should-worry-congress" target="_blank"&gt;analysis of the status of US aid operations&lt;/a&gt; that “right now, Congress and taxpayers have no visibility on what the foreign assistance system is trying to accomplish, let alone if that is happening.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Secretary of State Marco Rubio has stated PEPFAR is an important and life-saving program that will continue, a State Department spokesperson told CNN, adding that Rubio has “also said that PEPFAR, like all assistance programs, should be reduced over time as they are impactful in achieving their mission.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Last week, the State Department announced a joint commitment with the Global Fund to purchase the drug lenacapavir, an HIV prevention injection that only has to be taken twice a year, from the American biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences. PEPFAR will distribute the drug in eight to 12 high-burden HIV countries in 2026, with a focus on reducing the number of new HIV infections in pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, according to a State Department &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/the-united-states-presidents-emergency-plan-for-aids-relief/2025/09/pepfar-commits-to-distributing-breakthrough-hiv-drug-lenacapavir-demonstrating-american-excellence-in-science-and-american-leadership-in-hiv-prevention/" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.

            The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has released only about half ($2.9 billion) of the $6 billion appropriated by Congress for PEPFAR’s 2025 funding, according to &lt;a href="https://openomb.org/file/11440522#tafs_11440522--019-1031-2025-2029--3--2025" target="_blank"&gt;budget documents&lt;/a&gt; on a nonprofit website that tracks the OMB.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmff38e5x00123b6n97w6jv3g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A congressional aide raised concerns that the budget document listed billions of dollars of this year’s funds as part of fiscal year 2026, which the aide described as atypical.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmff38e5x00133b6nmucz1miz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A budget expert told CNN that the 2025 PEPFAR apportionment looks “weird” compared to &lt;a href="https://openomb.org/file/11396527#tafs_11396527--019-1031-2024-2028--2--2025" target="_blank"&gt;previous years’ documents&lt;/a&gt;, which typically specify how much money is going to each government department involved in PEPFAR. For this year, the released funds are listed as “unallocated” and conditional on a spending plan that has to be agreed upon by OMB and the State Department. Those spending plans are not publicly available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmff38e5x00143b6nunmmnm7l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The source also said that placing the funds into fiscal year 2026 is at least an indication that OMB is not willing to spend the PEPFAR money now, and it could be an attempt to “slow walk” the funding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmff38e5x00153b6nze3xz453@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another congressional aide told CNN that Congress doesn’t have a clear picture because of a lag time in the information the White House must report to the public. It’s possible that 2025 funding could still be released in the coming weeks and months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmff38e5x00163b6n29312e6p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The picture of funding flows remains fuzzy, and it comes after the Trump administration already tried to claw back $400 million for PEPFAR. That proposal was canceled after bipartisan opposition in the Senate. Yet not all of those funds had been released, top Senate appropriator Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, told CNN in a statement last week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmff38e5x00173b6nmnkuuhxn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “OMB is blocking funding for PEPFAR, one of the most successful global health programs in history,” Collins said. “PEPFAR funds are simply not reaching those in need, as confirmed by those in the field.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmff38e5x00183b6n3geqjfcr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, has called out OMB Director Russell Vought directly, saying that “even after promising Republican lawmakers that the program would be protected, he’s choked off a huge chunk of funding provided by Congress for PEPFAR.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmff38e5x00193b6nrf7fak55@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The law is clear as day: the full funding Congress provided must be used for the work PEPFAR does day in and out. The more these funds are obstructed and delayed, the more people will die needlessly,” Murray told CNN in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmff38e5x001a3b6ndtsteon1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CNN has reached out to OMB for comment but has not received a response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmff38e5x001c3b6ne64x9fdw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Separately, last week, Trump notified Congress he was moving to cancel $4.9 billion in foreign aid already approved for this year, drawing criticism from lawmakers from both parties who questioned the legality of the move. The US Government Accountability Office says rescissions so late in the fiscal year are illegal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmff38e5x001d3b6no8ys9t0y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last Wednesday, a federal judge ruled that without congressional approval, the administration can’t decide to withhold federally budgeted foreign aid money that will expire at the end of this month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfgvyd5o000a3b6nw5upr6uf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the White House is mounting a multi-front effort to do so both in the courts and on Capitol Hill, with Trump &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/08/politics/supreme-court-trump-foreign-aid"&gt;asking the Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; on Monday to step back into the fight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Though these symptoms are most typically blamed on aging, lack of sleep, or distraction, there can be a less apparent, often undervalued offender: cortisol- the body's natural stress hormone. But when cortisol is elevated for hours, it has a profound impact on memory and brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is cortisol and its impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5619133/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cortisol &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;is secreted by the adrenal glands due to physical or emotional stress. Its principal role is to assist in regulating the metabolism, blood sugar, blood pressure, and immune system. In a brief, stressful encounter, cortisol enhances concentration and gives access to additional energy. This is one of the body's most important defense mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issues occur when stress is chronic and cortisol remains heightened for extended periods. Chronic exposure to high cortisol has been associated with numerous health issues, such as diminished cognitive function, mood swings, and even alterations in the brain's structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Have you ever sought medical advice for symptoms related to high cortisol?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The brain on cortisol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important impacts of cortisol is in the brain, and that is in the hippocampus. That region of the brain is at the center of learning and memory creation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research indicates that too much cortisol can reduce the size of the hippocampus, shutting out the brain from forming and remembering things properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortisol also disrupts neurogenesis, the process whereby new brain cells are created. The fewer new brain cells there are, the less there is room for storing memories and the more delayed processing of new material. It can lead to persistent forgetfulness and inability to focus in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, cortisol interferes with sleep. Proper sleeping is vital to memory consolidation, and chronic sleep interference by excessive cortisol continues to have an impact on cognitive functioning. Without proper rest, the brain is unable to carry out memory-based processes effectively, establishing a cycle of mental tiredness and poor mental sharpness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the research says&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific research continues to confirm the connection between high cortisol and impaired memory. A recent study published in the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6405479/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt; journal Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in 2018 observed that individuals who had high levels of cortisol during middle life had reduced brain volumes and lower memory functioning even when not showing symptoms of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still another study by researchers at the University of Iowa discovered that prolonged exposure of cortisol in animal models caused loss of memory. Surprisingly, with cortisol returning to its baseline levels, some cognitive abilities started to recover, indicating that damage can be reversible with appropriate interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research titled "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27918271/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Stress-induced cortisol hampers memory generalisation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;" it clearly shows that participants who were exposed to stress before learning tasks, demonstrated a significant reduction in their ability to generalise learned associations to new, untrained pairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cortisol's role&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The observed deficit in memory generalisation was closely linked to magnitude of cortisol increase following the stressor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results mirror clinical reports of anxious and depressed patients, two illnesses both of which are typically accompanied by dysregulated cortisol.

Hypertension was the primary contributor of 664,470 deaths in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/high-blood-pressure/about/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;). What’s worse is that about 46% are unaware that they have this &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;condition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. If left untreated, high blood pressure or hypertension can put you at a greater risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, and even early death. High blood pressure is often called a ‘silent killer’ as symptoms are largely absent, and some of the subtle signs get dismissed. Dr Evan Levine, a board-certified cardiologist with over 30 years of experience, has now explained some of the most common symptoms of hypertension. Let’s take a look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Natural Ways to Control High Blood Pressure Effectively&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What is hypertension?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypertension (high blood pressure) occurs when the pressure in the blood vessels is too high. Normal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm Hg. Blood pressure that is consistently at or above 130/80 mm Hg is considered high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the blood pressure varies throughout the day depending on the activities, consistent blood pressure is a warning sign. Over time, this high blood pressure damages the arteries, leading to serious complications like a heart attack and stroke. Catching it early is crucial for a healthy life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Have you ever experienced any symptoms related to hypertension?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Symptoms of hypertension&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headache:&lt;/strong&gt; “It can be across the head or in the back,” the doctor explains in a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOI0UFbjmwg/?igsh=ZG1zN3ZrYzZpZjM3" target="_blank"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; shared on Instagram.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurred vision:&lt;/strong&gt; It is a common symptom; however, it's often dismissed as other, less severe illnesses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shortness of breath:&lt;/strong&gt; If you find yourself gasping for air, usually when you're walking, it is a warning sign. “But if it gets really severe, you can get short of breath even at rest,” the cardiologist says.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chest pain:&lt;/strong&gt; According to Dr. Levine, it almost feels “like angina that we call when you're walking because the heart is working too hard.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nosebleed:&lt;/strong&gt; Some people complain of nosebleeds. “We call it epistaxis. Some people don't believe in that,” he adds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frothy urine:&lt;/strong&gt; “It's frothy because you're spilling protein when you go to the bathroom. You may notice that,” he explains. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Pulmonary Hypertension: Recognizing the critical symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;#1 symptom of hypertension&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes high blood pressure especially dangerous is that it shows no symptoms in most people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The number one symptom of hypertension. The most common symptom by far, everyone should know about is nothing. That's right! That's why we call it the silent killer,” Dr. Levine explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cardiologist suggests getting blood pressure checked often to catch it early. “You need to get your blood pressure checked at least annually. Now, if you can't afford to see a physician, well, check it at home. Get an Omron blood pressure cuff at the store or Amazon. Watch a YouTube video before and share the cuff with your friends and family,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Remember, the most common symptom of hypertension is nothing. You don't want to present with heart failure, a stroke, or a heart attack because you didn't check your blood pressure,” the cardiologist stresses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This information is for educational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Cases have now been reported in at least eight states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are now about to &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" title="External link — categorize the infectious disease as endemic"&gt;categorize the infectious disease as endemic&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; , meaning occurring regularly within an area or community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not just a medical formality but a wake-up call: The disease would no longer be considered an imported tropical disease but regarded as a permanently present health risk in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed classification would have far-reaching consequences for monitoring, research and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Disease transmitted by bug's bite&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disease is passed on by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite, which is found in various predatory bug species. The insect acquired the nickname "kissing bug" because it often bites sleeping humans in the face, in particular its more thin-skinned parts, such as lips or eyelids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not the bite itself that is dangerous, but the feces of the bug that contain the pathogen. By scratching the wound or rubbing the eyes the parasite makes its way into the body. Less frequently, &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/infectious-diseases/t-71255642"&gt;people are infected&lt;/a&gt; via blood transfusions, organ transplants or during a pregnancy from mother to child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="66137086" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/66137086_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="Hand in a latex glove holds tweezers and a bed bug"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;The Chagas disease is passed on by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite, which is found in various predatory bugs&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: DW&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;WHO warns of neglected danger&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disease was named after Brazilian doctor Carlos Chagas, who discovered it in 1907. By now, Chagas is no longer some exotic tropical disease. Through migration, blood transfusions and global trade routes Chagas also found its way to Europe and North America. According to estimates, there are some 6,000 infected people in Spain and several hundred thousand in the US. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/world-health-organization-who/t-38396203"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; estimates that, &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-chagas-disease-day/2025" title="External link — worldwide, over seven million people are infected with the pathogen"&gt;worldwide, over seven million people are infected with the pathogen&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and that some 10,000 die each year as a result of the infection. The disease is particularly widespread in Latin America's poor regions, which is why the WHO classifies it as a "neglected disease." Due to new data from the US the potentially lethal "disease of the poor" is now increasingly receiving international attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms of Chagas disease?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The infection has two stages. Many of those affected don't notice any symptoms during the first weeks or months after the infection. Some develop unspecific symptoms such as fever, fatigue or swellings next to the wound, typically an eyelid edema, a painless, one-sided swelling of the eyelid which is often accompanied by conjunctivitis. Afterwards, those ailments usually disappear again, but the parasite remains in the body. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a lag period that can take years, the chronic phase of the infection can break out. This comes with has serious consequences. Myocarditis, permanent heart failure, or cardiac arrhythmia have been documented, as well as pathological enlargement of esophagus and colon. Up to 30% of those infected develop such complications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WHO warns that, without treatment, the disease can be life-threatening, primarily for babies, children or people with a weakened immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-vendor-cmp-id="c44391" data-lang-code="en" data-id="68339716" class="embed dw-widget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How can Chagas disease be treated?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the acute phase, the parasite can be detected microscopically in the blood. In later stages, antibody tests are the most important diagnostic tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, there is no vaccine. Treatment is based on two antiparasitic drugs, Nifurtimox and Benznidazole, which are particularly effective during the acute phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both medications, however, can cause severe side effects and are &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/paediatric-investigation-plans/emea-003134-pip01-21" title="External link — not yet officially approved for treatment of the Chagas disease"&gt;not yet officially approved for treatment of the Chagas disease&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/european-union-eu/t-17440066"&gt;EU&lt;/a&gt;, for example. In the US, the drugs can usually be administered during inpatient treatment only. In chronic cases, the therapy just alleviates the symptoms; so far the disease can hardly be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed yt-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pets and wild animals can get infected too&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only humans are sought-after victims: Dogs, cats, rats, armadillos and opossums are also considered important hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Texas and California, in particular, are now increasingly reporting infected dogs, which indicates that circulation of the pathogen is already established in the south of the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to protect against Chagas disease?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to prevent an infection, expert recommend strict protection against insects. In affected regions, nets treated with insecticide, the sealing of house walls and specific pes control can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For pets, veterinarians recommend medication which is also used against fleas and ticks. In many countries, blood donations are now routinely tested for the pathogen, in order to prevent an infection by blood transfusion.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the vast majority, around 85 percent, of hospital patients received antiviral medication like Tamiflu, which can reduce the severity and duration of illness, treatment rates were lowest among children and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is likely because parents are more likely to believe it is a mild illness for children and that their robust immune systems can easily fight it off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this is not always the case. CDC researchers did not quantify how many children died last flu season, but the American Academy of Pediatrics put the death toll last season &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32150/Pediatric-flu-deaths-hit-record-high-for-non?autologincheck=redirected"&gt;at 216&lt;/a&gt;, making it the deadliest non-pandemic flu season on record for U.S. children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists affiliated with the WHO and the CDC meet every year to determine which strains the upcoming season’s flu vaccine should prioritize. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vaccine formula doesn’t always align perfectly with the circulating virus. However, on average, flu vaccines reduce the risk of needing to visit the doctor by 30 percent to 60 percent and drastically reduce the severity of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Protection wanes throughout the season, so October is the best time to get vaccinated. The CDC recommends annual flu shots for everyone six months and older, including young, healthy people with no underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Selecting the strains for the annual flu vaccine requires health officials to predict which viruses will dominate the upcoming season. The vaccine's effectiveness hinges entirely on the accuracy of their forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last season, the CDC estimated the vaccine was between 41 percent and 78 percent effective at preventing flu-related hospitalizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;With a rate of 127.1 hospitalizations per 100,000 people, the 2024-25 flu season was significantly more severe than historical norms, surpassing the previous 14-season average of 62&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its effectiveness at preventing less severe infections that still required a doctor's visit ranged from 32 percent to 60 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most people with the flu recover within a few days or a week. But the flu kills about 36,000 Americans every year, and it can be more dangerous than people think, especially for seniors 75 and up, people with respiratory conditions such as asthma, people with obesity and/or heart disease and the unvaccinated.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to common symptoms, including fever, muscle aches, respiratory infection, chills, and fatigue, the flu can cause life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia, a bloodstream infection called sepsis, inflammation of the heart and brain, and muscle inflammation or damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest data from the CDC reflect the most recent flu season recorded in the agency’s surveillance system, FluSurv-NET. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The system collects data from roughly 300 hospitals across 14 states, effectively monitoring a sample that represents about nine percent of the US population, or around 31 million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The system focuses on laboratory-confirmed flu cases that are severe enough to require hospitalization, tracking individuals from infants to seniors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For a carefully selected subset of patients out of the thousands reported, researchers pulled detailed clinical information from medical records to determine whether patients had underlying health conditions, their vaccination status and whether they required intensive care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For children, the most significant risk factor for hospitalization was asthma. It was the most common pre-existing condition for 14 percent of hospitalized toddlers and preschoolers up to four years old and nearly 40 percent of school-aged children and teens from five to 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Last flu season, Influenza A was the dominant and most severe virus type. While the H1N1 strain was more common overall and posed a greater threat to seniors, this was a reversal from the last severe season, 2017-18, when the H3N2 strain was the main risk for that age group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For young adults aged 18 to 49, obesity was the dominant risk factor, present in about 44 percent of hospitalized patients in this age group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In adults aged 50 to 64, chronic metabolic diseases, primarily diabetes, took the lead, affecting 45.6 percent of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For seniors, cardiovascular disease was the most significant risk factor, found in 57 percent of adults aged 65 to 74 and an overwhelming 69 percent of those aged 75 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The flu season was historically severe, with hospitals having seen more flu patients per week than in any other season since 2010–2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No age group was spared. Hospitalization rates were two to three times higher across all ages compared to the average of the past 14 seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As in most flu seasons, adults 75 and older were hit hardest, with a rate of nearly 599 hospitalizations per 100,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was the second-highest rate on record for seniors, but it was the worst season ever recorded for every other age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thirty percent of patients developed pneumonia, making it the most common complication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 18.5 percent of cases, the infection spiraled into sepsis, a catastrophic full-body inflammatory response, and caused acute kidney failure in another 18 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This severe season was primarily driven by influenza A viruses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The H1N1 strain was more prevalent overall, but, notably, it caused higher hospitalization rates among older adults compared to the H3N2 strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This marked a reversal from the last severe season, 2017-2018, when H3N2 was the dominant and more dangerous strain for seniors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2025–2026 flu vaccine is trivalent, meaning it protects against three strains: an influenza A(H1N1)-like virus, an influenza A(H3N2)-like virus, and an influenza B/Victoria lineage-like virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The flu shot is typically free with insurance. Almost all insurers are required to cover shots recommended by the CDC, including flu shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without insurance, though, the price can change based on the pharmacy, ranging from $20 to $120. Public clinics also generally offer free flu shots.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="17a61402-55cf-45f5-858f-a89aeed9a57b"&gt;Weight loss is a complex and emotive process, with many factors at play that can impact results. And keeping the weight off can be even harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Biologically, our bodies are designed to defend against losing weight,” says &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/5161f952-8468-4714-88f3-782a81998e49" target="_blank" data-url="https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/5161f952-8468-4714-88f3-782a81998e49" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Dr Rachel Woods&lt;/a&gt;, a senior lecturer in physiology at the University of Lincoln in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="17a61402-55cf-45f5-858f-a89aeed9a57b-2"&gt;“When we reduce calorie intake, the body responds by slowing metabolism and increasing hunger signals, essentially trying to conserve energy,” says Woods, who has spent nearly 15 years working in and around health and nutrition research. “This makes sustaining weight loss very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On top of this, we live in an environment that poses significant challenges. Busy lives, long working hours and easy access to convenient, energy-dense foods make it hard to adhere to calorie-restricted diets consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Social pressures, stress and fatigue can also contribute to people choosing less nutritious foods. Together, these biological and environmental factors create a perfect storm that makes weight loss a real challenge for many people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And keeping it off can be even harder, says Woods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people are able to manage the challenges of calorie restriction for a limited period, which is often enough to achieve the initial weight loss they’re looking for. During this time, motivation is high and the effort feels purposeful. However, sustaining the same level of restraint over the long term is so much harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-mBsCicXTuMVJWuSNQbHLyH" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-mBsCicXTuMVJWuSNQbHLyH slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The body continues to resist weight loss, with hunger signals remaining stronger and metabolism slightly slowed. Coupled with the mental and physical effort required to consistently eat differently from your habits or environment, maintaining that calorie deficit over months and years becomes extremely challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is why long-term weight maintenance is often harder than the initial weight loss phase, and why sustainable, realistic changes are essential for lasting success.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what does Woods recommend as the best approach to losing weight and keeping it off?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My advice is to focus less on weight itself and more on improving diet and lifestyle for overall health,” says Woods. “Weight loss may follow naturally as a result. If someone specifically wants to lose weight, the key is to adopt habits that are sustainable in the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the five habits that Woods recommends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-step-one-eat-more-plants" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-step-one-eat-more-plants"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step one: Eat more plants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check id="a11024f9-9b60-411d-b546-55ed9ee11df6"&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images / 10'000 Hours)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="602fa057-45f7-41a2-a02e-1229929e5858"&gt;“Fruits, vegetables, beans and lentils are nutrient-dense, high in fiber and relatively low in calories. Increasing these foods in your meals helps you feel full and may naturally reduce the intake of higher-calorie snacks,” says Woods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-step-two-prioritise-whole-foods-over-heavily-processed-ones" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-step-two-prioritise-whole-foods-over-heavily-processed-ones"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step two: Prioritise whole foods over heavily processed ones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="7ceb2272-cd88-490f-b0d9-5eb026168c50"&gt;“Whole foods are generally more filling, nutrient-rich and less likely to make you overeat. A simple way to identify processed snacks is to check the ingredient list and choose foods made from ingredients you recognise and can pronounce,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-step-three-reduce-alcohol-intake" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-step-three-reduce-alcohol-intake"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step three: Reduce alcohol intake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="a839a916-fa8a-4e7f-8f1e-f84afaf216c5"&gt;“Alcohol adds extra calories without filling you up and has a negative impact on many areas of health. Cutting back can have a significant impact over time,” says Woods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-step-four-consider-portion-adjustments-strategically" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-step-four-consider-portion-adjustments-strategically"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step four: Consider portion adjustments strategically&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="820ed4ea-f70e-4da2-982b-4cbe9ea8231a"&gt;“Rather than simply eating smaller portions of everything, which can leave you hungry, try increasing your portions of low-calorie, nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables and salads while moderating higher-calorie items,” says Woods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-step-five-choose-sugar-free-drinks-or-water-instead-of-sodas" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-step-five-choose-sugar-free-drinks-or-water-instead-of-sodas"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Step five: Choose sugar-free drinks or water instead of sodas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="1fef162e-158e-4d97-8ea3-51610af51551"&gt;“If you drink a lot of sugary beverages, this is an easy swap that reduces calorie intake,” says Woods. “The overarching principle is sustainability. Small, consistent changes are better than drastic restrictions that are hard to maintain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-what-about-exercise" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-about-exercise"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What about exercise?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="3300e9c6-646d-49b1-b2f8-0f523549f363"&gt;“Diet generally has a larger impact on creating a calorie deficit, but exercise is also incredibly valuable for overall health. It supports cardiovascular fitness, strengthens muscles and bones, improves mood and sleep, and helps manage stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When combined with dietary changes, exercise can help protect against weight regain, support metabolic health and improve body composition—for example, maintaining lean muscle while losing fat. So, while it may not always be the fastest route to weight loss, it’s critical for long-term health and wellbeing.”&lt;/p&gt;

Medication and lifestyle modification are crucial, but foods consumed every day can regulate blood glucose or make it challenging to do so. 2025 nutrition science supports the complementary role of plant, nutrient-dense foods that condition the body to improve insulin sensitivity, lower inflammation, and level glucose. Four of these foods that are leaders are moringa, blueberries, chia seeds, and cinnamon. They are convenient, easy, and simple to add to food on a daily basis and provide strong benefits to those with diabetes. Take a look..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Drumstick (Moringa)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229919316991" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;moringa &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;or drumstick has been used in traditional African and Indian medicine for centuries. In the past few years, moringa became extremely popular worldwide because of its excellent nutritional benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6950081/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Moringa &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;leaves contain antioxidants, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron as well. The most amazing thing about moringa is that it can bring blood sugar levels down for diabetic patients. Experiments have shown that the compounds present in moringa render the body hypersensitive to insulin so that the body is able to make better use of the glucose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking moringa tea or combining powder leaves with smoothies, soups, or dals can be an easy lifestyle habit. Moringa contains anti-inflammatory properties, which is generally a root cause of insulin resistance. Because it helps to increase the metabolic and energy levels, it is a natural source of energy for individuals who are working hard to maintain blood sugar under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chia seeds&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tiny &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/9074404.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;seeds &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;are literally referred to as a superfood for a reason. It has fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, and protein. The soluble fiber from the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1098882324001011" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; behaves like a gel when full, which retards digestion and the movement in which the sugar moves into the body. What this means is that less spiking and crashing of blood sugar occurs, allowing diabetics to feel more on an even keel during the course of the day. Chia seeds also help with weight control, an equally important aspect of diabetes management in that they make one feel full and keep one from eating too much food. Their regular intake reduces blood pressure and cholesterol levels and help in eliminating heart disease, which is usually associated with diabetes. They can be added to oatmeal bowls, yogurt, smoothies and can be ingested just as it is! That is how versatile this tiny superfood is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Which of these plant-based foods would you like to try for diabetes management?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Blueberries&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5187542/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Blueberries &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;are one of the healthiest berries to eat for diabetics, as they are low on the glycemic index but rich in antioxidants and vitamins. Blueberries contain anthocyanins, plant compounds that make cells more insulin-sensitive and enable the body to utilize glucose more effectively. They were found in clinical trials to decrease oxidative stress, which damages cells and worsens diabetes complications. Most fruits are causing an immediate rise in blood sugar, but blueberries are sweet naturally without elevating blood sugar levels right away. Blueberries also support brain function and memory, a bonus. Fresh blueberries are ideal, but frozen blueberries are equally as healthy and may be added to smoothies, placed on cereals as a topping, or eaten directly from the freezer as a fast snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also See: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/diabetes-dietitian-recommends-four-foods-to-lower-blood-sugar-to-non-diabetic-level/articleshow/123293218.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Diabetes dietitian recommends four foods to lower blood sugar to non-diabetic level&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cinnamon&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those foods that households tend to have sitting on the shelf in their spice jar, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dmsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13098-023-01057-2" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;cinnamon &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;is a useful inclusion in diabetes treatment.

Cinnamon is extremely easy to add to daily nutrition. A dash of it in tea, coffee, or smoothies adds taste and discreetly gets to work on stabilizing blood sugar levels. Research also suggests that cinnamon may improve insulin sensitivity, reduce oxidative stress, and support metabolic health when used consistently over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 03:22:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6wFBVV95cUxPSG9qdmRYN2tlcHhROUVEbkpMV1QyZ19HdEQ3dWtDVTRMSmNfQ2ZhaGhOMGVjVHRjaDJRbTNydmh4M29WQUs0NWdLTU1pSmV4aTFRb3B1UlY0N0Z5RnVQbU1TVjhnLXk2bFZTRTFLdG1yNVFCOWhVdVo2WUc3SGUwdldjVUtDZmZVMlNtYVlRVkdmR0h6Wnk0UDFjZC1lX3ZXUG9nWVdmS0lCaXFzelpScGgzZUt3VUJIenNIMW5ycmFVMVp1dXdzbEZWbFdiSlBVaXdIWlVHRk1EQ3ZNTHlHQXludG5kMmVqRk1B</guid></item><item><title>脂肪肝的突破：安全、廉价的维生素显示出前景- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250912195101.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Approximately 30% of the global population is affected by metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MASLD), a condition that previously lacked targeted treatments. In a groundbreaking discovery, researchers have identified a genetic factor that exacerbates the disease, and remarkably, the FDA-approved drug that most effectively targets this factor is vitamin B3.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A collaborative research team led by Professor Jang Hyun Choi from the Department of Life Sciences at UNIST, in partnership with Professor Hwayoung Yun from the College of Pharmacy and Research Institute for Drug Development at Pusan National University (PNU), and Professor Neung Hwa Park from Ulsan University Hospital (UUH), has, for the first time globally, elucidated the role of microRNA-93 (miR-93), which is expressed in the liver, as a key genetic regulator in the development and progression of MASLD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MiR-93 is a specialized RNA molecule expressed in hepatocytes that functions to suppress the expression of specific target genes. The team observed abnormally elevated levels of miR-93 in both patients with fatty liver disease and animal models. Through molecular analysis, they demonstrated that miR-93 promotes lipid accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis by inhibiting the expression of SIRT1, a gene involved in lipid metabolism within liver cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In experiments utilizing gene editing techniques to eliminate miR-93 production in mice, researchers observed a marked reduction in hepatic fat accumulation, along with significant improvements in insulin sensitivity and liver function indicators. Conversely, mice with overexpressed miR-93 exhibited worsened hepatic metabolic function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, screening 150 FDA-approved drugs revealed that niacin (vitamin B3) most effectively suppresses miR-93. Mice treated with niacin showed a significant decrease in hepatic miR-93 levels and a notable increase in SIRT1 activity. The activated SIRT1 restored disrupted lipid metabolism pathways, thereby normalizing liver lipid homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team explained, "This study precisely elucidates the molecular origin of MASLD and demonstrates the potential for repurposing an already approved vitamin compound to modulate this pathway, which has high translational clinical relevance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added, "Given that niacin is a well-established and safe medication used to treat hyperlipidemia, it holds promise as a candidate for combination therapies targeting miRNA pathways in MASLD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research was supported by various including the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) and the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB). The findings were published online in the prestigious biomedical journal, &lt;em&gt;Metabolism: Clinical and Experimental&lt;/em&gt;. Participants include Dr. Yo Han Lee and Kieun Park from UNIST, along with Professor Joonho Jeong from Ulsan University Hospital and Jinyoung Lee from Pusan National University, as co-first authors.&lt;/p&gt;

As with many large-scale nutrition studies, this was observational, meaning researchers did not alter participants’ diets but instead relied on self-reported food intake over time. “The problem is that self-reporting isn’t always accurate; people forget, exaggerate or simply don’t remember exactly what or how much they ate,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dlfai" data-offset-key="3sh0j-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3sh0j-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3sh0j-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;She also pointed out that the studies included in the meta-analysis varied in structure and methodology, which can make it difficult to draw uniform conclusions. “Other factors like physical activity or sleep weren’t always examined thoroughly,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dlfai" data-offset-key="f9spo-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="f9spo-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="f9spo-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Still, Shahar emphasized that the overall message remains clear: “Even if observational studies don’t prove direct cause and effect, they support what we already know: diets rich in vegetables, particularly cruciferous ones, can play a significant role in reducing cancer risk. And when it comes to vegetables, variety and color are key."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dlfai" data-offset-key="22mb1-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="22mb1-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="22mb1-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Ultimately, Shahar reminded, cruciferous vegetables are only part of the picture. “A healthy lifestyle overall is essential. That means eating foods as close to their natural form as possible and avoiding highly processed items, which are increasingly linked to cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="dlfai" data-offset-key="d567q-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="d567q-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="d567q-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Physical activity is also crucial, as is getting enough sleep, something many people neglect. Avoiding smoking and alcohol, following medical screening recommendations and managing stress are all vital. Ultimately, mental well-being is just as important as physical health. Reducing stress and pressure, as much as possible, is at the heart of it all."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2025 01:54:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXEFVX3lxTFB4NWVxVTIwcnNhWFlXWVQyZWl0NUFoZHJHdXlaNXhaYkxNLWEtdTNKNE9IUEVXWl8zNlZWVDBVbUYtRHFYd3UwdHdOLXNGaW5OUHNBc1hXVW1yMExx</guid></item><item><title>您是否以错误的方式服用维生素D ？顶级医生分享解决问题的建议-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/are-you-taking-vitamin-d-the-wrong-way-top-doctor-shares-tips-to-fix-it/photostory/123862103.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is a nutrient the body needs to maintain healthy bones, support immune function, and promote overall well-being. Also known as the ‘sunshine vitamin’, this nutrient can be naturally produced by the body when exposed to the sun. But when the exposure is limited or the body fails to produce enough vitamin D, many turn to supplements. However, that doesn’t provide adequate vitamin D to the body. Some common mistakes can interfere with its absorption and lead to a deficiency.

Also known as the ‘sunshine vitamin’, this nutrient can be naturally produced by the body when exposed to the sun. But when the exposure is limited or the body fails to produce enough vitamin D, many turn to supplements. However, that doesn’t provide adequate vitamin D to the body. Some common mistakes can interfere with its absorption and lead to a deficiency.

    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Ramneek Dosanjh got married young. But before long, she says her marriage dissolved into a cycle of control and domestic violence.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Within a week of meeting and dating, tells you they love you and they will marry you, you know, it all seems dreamy," Dosanjh told CBS News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It got worse, she says, when she tried to leave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You just don't know if you can sustain living that way," said Dosanjh, who then chose to get an order of protection against her then-husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The toll on her health started to show. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; "I had abnormal stress tests," Dosanjh said. "I had to have a cardiac catheterization."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; And she's not alone according to a study &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/stalking-obtaining-restraining-order-linked-with-increased-cardiovascular-disease-risk-in-women/#:~:text=Boston%2C%20MA%E2%80%94Women%20with%20experience,Chan%20School%20of%20Public%20Health." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; last month by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We saw this association, which frankly also blew me away," said Dr. Karestan Koenen, who led a team of Harvard researchers who analyzed data for about 66,270 American nurses, ages 36 to 56, who were surveyed about their own health for 20 years between 2001 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of those in the survey, 11.7% reported experience with stalking, and 5.6% reported experience with obtaining a restraining order. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.073592" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;published in the scientific journal Circulation&lt;/a&gt;, found that the risk for &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/heart-disease/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; was 41% higher in women who had experienced stalking — and 70% higher for women who had obtained a restraining order — compared to those who had not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have all the information on their diet and exercise," Koenen said. "And we find that it's really the stalking that increases the risk, not all these other factors, because we can adjust for them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Experiences of stalking and obtaining a restraining order are both associated with an increased risk of developing CVD (cardiovascular disease) in women," the study concluded. "Common experiences of violence among women may affect cardiovascular health and warrant consideration alongside more traditional risk factors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the women that CBS News talked to were afraid to disclose their identities. One of them says she and her children were abused by their father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had three recurring episodes of deep vein thrombosis, which means another three blood clots in a short amount of time," the woman told CBS News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stalkingawareness.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NISVS_-Report-on-Stalking-Updated-Release-2016-2017-%E2%80%93-Centers-for-Disease-Control-and-Prevention-2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;According to&lt;/a&gt; a 2016-2017 survey from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly one in three women have experienced stalking at some point in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say the results of the study could spur doctors to add questions about stalking and restraining orders when screening for heart health risk factors in the future.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Said Koenen, "The ultimate goal is to improve women's health."&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;Breaking with national public health policy, California officials are recommending that children 6 months to 2 years old, as well as people who are pregnant and lactating, should get vaccinated against COVID-19, following guidance from reputable medical groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement to KQED, the California Department of Public Health said Wednesday that it endorses recent recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for COVID-19, influenza and RSV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidance, released last month, was in line with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations under the Biden Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a part of our efforts, along with our West Coast state partners and other states around the country, to provide a unified science-based approach to protecting the health of our communities, California is carefully considering guidance from various trusted national medical professional and scientifically based organizations,” the CDPH said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Typically, the CDC sets vaccine recommendations based on the available data, which insurers use to set reimbursement guidelines. But under the direction of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — who has espoused virulent anti-vaccine rhetoric for decades — the CDC now only &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; COVID vaccines for “most adults ages 18 years and older.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That left many in the medical community concerned that confusing and inconsistent messaging would cause vaccine rates to drop, and even make vaccines unaffordable for lower-income families whose insurance providers may no longer cover them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/abraar-karan" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Dr. Abraar Karan&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease physician at Stanford University, said the state is making a “wise” choice because data show that vaccines help minimize COVID-19 infections in typically healthier populations like children older than six months and young adults, and reduce the risk of urgent care and emergency room visits for COVID-19 patients “by 33%.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s pretty significant, and sort of mirrors what you see with flu vaccines as well. Functionally, that is what we are hoping for, for the general population, is to make you get less sick, fewer days of [missed] work [and] less utilization of the health care system,” Karan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mem-embed mem-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“COVID spreads in waves. We have multiple waves per year, and they do require a large usage of our health care system. So if we have a safe, effective vaccine to reduce that healthcare usage in that healthier group, that’s important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karan said that because California is following the guidance of leading medical groups, it’s likely insurance companies will cover the shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, he said, those states are adhering to the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whereas what is happening at HHS is … a lot of opinions, particularly from RFK Jr. himself, on unproven therapeutics, on risks that are not borne out by the data. And then he’s sort of just hand-waving and doing whatever he wants,” Karan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, Kennedy &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5428533/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisory-committee-acip" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; all 17 members of an advisory committee that helps the CDC form its vaccine policies to begin to “&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/wsj-kennedy-op-ed-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines.html" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;restore public trust in vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/people/john-swartzberg" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Dr. John Swartzberg&lt;/a&gt;, professor emeritus of infectious diseases and vaccinology at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health, said that by following the advice of leading medical groups, California and the other states of the West Coast Alliance are making it easier for families to get their children vaccinated against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you look at the data for very young children in terms of hospitalization and death, the rates are pretty comparable to older Americans,” Swartzberg said. “This is a vulnerable population where protection is terribly important. So I think that the California Department of Public Health, in following the advice of the American Academy of Pediatrics, is spot on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swartzberg said it is interesting to note that President Donald Trump even pushed back on Kennedy’s anti-vax stance in the last few days. Trump even &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/08/vaccine-policy-cracks-showing-between-trump-kennedy/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;expressed some skepticism&lt;/a&gt; about Florida’s push to phase out all childhood vaccine mandates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think there are people in the administration who recognize that this is a hot button item, and all the Republicans are not really on board with where Kennedy is, so that might translate into the administration not trying to make a political football out of this with California,” he said. “We are very fortunate here in California. We have a department of health that is science-based and really solid.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Who can get a new COVID vaccine right now?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updated 2025–26 COVID-19 vaccines are currently available at &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cvs.com/scheduling/patient-lookup?lob=rximz&amp;amp;flow=vaccine&amp;amp;icid=global-nav" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;CVS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.walgreens.com/topic/promotion/covid-vaccine.jsp?ban=immhub_covidinfo" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Walgreens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.safeway.com/pharmacy/covid-19.html" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Safeway &lt;/a&gt;pharmacies in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Pharmacies take their cue from the federal government, not the states, so they’ve always been the first places that COVID-19 vaccines roll out — before shots become more widely available through providers and public health authorities.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These pharmacy appointments are only available to people who, during the online booking process, say they are either:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Age 65 and older&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have a health condition that could make someone at higher risk from COVID-19&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what counts as “high risk”? To find out if you or a family member might qualify, you can consult &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/risk-factors/index.html" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;the CDC’s current list of health conditions&lt;/a&gt; that potentially put you at higher risk of severe illness, hospitalization or death from COVID-19, which includes cancer, chronic lung, kidney and liver disease and certain disabilities. However, it also encompasses other factors like mental health conditions — including depression — obesity and being a current or former smoker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When listing some of these conditions, CVS’s online appointment also suggests “any other conditions or situations that place you at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 (consult your pharmacist or medical provider if you need help).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mem-embed mem-end"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The union representing a dozen nurses who work in the 10-room pediatric wing said Providence officials have been discussing the move for weeks but have been “pretty tight-lipped” about details of the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providence, in a set of statements this week to The Press Democrat, stopped short of acknowledging any plans to close the wing and said no decision had been made about the future of the unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It handles non-emergency medical care for young patients admitted for overnight stays. Hospital officials say the unit sees an average of two admitted patients daily, but sources inside the unit say some of the beds are used for a greater number of patients, including those in post-surgery observation and post-partum care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-8p60lgsb" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_8p60lgsb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hospital officials have indicated to staff in a series of recent meetings that the unit is not financially sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of its prepared statements, Providence said it, like other health care providers, is experiencing “strong headwinds” in the current business landscape. Providence, based in Washington state, controls more than 51 hospitals and more than 1,000 clinics across seven western states, &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/about/northern-california"&gt;including three hospitals in Sonoma County, as well as Queen of the Valley Medical Center in Napa.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nurses in the pediatrics wing say they’re being told that young patients can be admitted to other facilities in the “community,” in San Francisco or Oakland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t consider that the community,” said one pediatrics nurse, who asked that her name not be used for fear of retaliation by her employer.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;The pediatrics nurse said Providence has made it clear it no longer wants to support a service that’s “losing millions a year, that’s what they’re telling us.”&lt;/p&gt;

(Christopher Chung/The Press Democrat)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an emailed statement Wednesday, Garry Olney, chief executive of Providence Northern California, cited in particular the “expected &lt;span&gt;financial impacts” of President Donald Trump’s recently passed tax, policy and spending bill. &lt;/span&gt;Provisions in the law are anticipated to put additional strain on suburban and rural hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Olney said Providence is “thoughtfully evaluating” operations at Memorial Hospital to understand how to best serve the local community. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“While this does include determining the right model of care for pediatrics in the community, these conversations are ongoing, and we don’t have specifics to share currently,” Olney said his statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;The Sonoma County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday was notified by a local physician about the possible closure. The Press Democrat has reached out to both the county Department of Health Services and the state Department of Health Care Services to determine whether Providence has informed them of possible closure plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supervisor Rebecca Hermosillo, whose district includes the Memorial Hospital campus, said Providence has reached out to her staff to schedule a meeting. She said hospitals nationwide are anticipating immense financial strain under the forthcoming terms of President Trump’s tax and spending law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need a hospital that serves our oldest and our youngest,” Hermosillo said. “But I understand hospitals have been losing money for a long time and it will get exponentially worse with the impacts of HR 1.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closure of Memorial Hospital’s pediatrics wing would represent Providence’s latest contraction in local services, following the &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2024/11/11/providence-to-close-southwest-santa-rosa-urgent-care-center-adding-to-regional-contraction-of-health-services-2/"&gt;closure of an urgent care center in southwest Santa Rosa&lt;/a&gt;; the elimination of the  &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2024/01/16/providence-to-shutter-outpatient-labs-at-multiple-california-hospitals-2/"&gt;three outpatient laboratories&lt;/a&gt; in the North Bay, &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2024/01/23/workers-critical-of-providence-plan-to-close-outpatient-labs-in-santa-rosa-petaluma-napa/"&gt;two in Sonoma and one in Napa counties&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2023/02/16/health-district-blasts-plans-to-close-petaluma-valley-hospitals-birth-center-after-contentious-meeting-2/"&gt;closure of the maternity ward at Petaluma Valley Hospital in 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providence agreed to pay &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2024/06/27/providence-to-pay-10-million-to-settle-dispute-over-closure-of-petaluma-maternity-ward-2/"&gt;almost $10 million to a local health care district&lt;/a&gt; to get out of its contractual obligation to operate the maternity ward at the Petaluma hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, Henry and Marilyn Hansel, owners of Sonoma County’s largest network of auto dealerships, donated $10 million to the foundation that supports Memorial Hospital to &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2025/05/14/hansel-family-donates-10-million-for-santa-rosa-memorial-hospitals-womens-health-cardiology-and-imaging-centers-2/"&gt;help fund construction of a health care hub for cardiology, imaging and women’s health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Brackner, president of Staff Nurses Association, the union that represents 782 registered nurses at Memorial Hospital, including about a dozen nurses in the inpatient pediatric unit, said Providence addressed the unit’s future during an all-hands staff meeting on Aug. 20. The issue came up at another staff meeting earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brackner said Scott Ciesielski, chief administrative officer at Providence Sonoma County, told nurses the pediatric wing’s “current model is not sustainable” and that the 10-bed wing had a daily average census of 1.96 patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brackner said Providence has been unwilling to share any substantive information about its plans for the wing since the Aug. 20 townhall. At that meeting, Ciesielski discussed bolstering outpatient support for pediatric patients and the possibility of having other inpatient departments absorb young patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re looking at dates that this could move forward,” Brackner said. “They said they’re not planning on rushing anything and want to look at what is best for the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pediatric wing cares for young patients with less intensive ailments, including jaundice in newborns; appendectomies; trauma patients (motor vehicle accidents); orthopedic issues such as broken bones; asthma; urinary tract infections; pneumonia, sepsis and croup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marybeth Takacs, a nurse who has worked in the Memorial Hospital pediatrics wing for more than 20 years, said Providence officials have been talking about the wing as a financial burden for about two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said officials often point out that more hospital beds are needed to alleviate overcrowding in the emergency department. While some some 500 children are treated each month in the emergency department, only between 40 to 50 are admitted into the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those numbers, Takacs said, do not reflect the true value of the wing. During the coronavirus pandemic, the pediatrics wing was used for COVID-19 patients and during the post-pandemic years some of the beds were used for adult patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter arrangement was difficult as it is not always appropriate to mix pediatric patients with some adult patients, she said, adding that the hospital is always looking for more patient beds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They want those (pediatric) beds for other people but not little people,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pediatrics nurse who asked to remain anonymous said talk of eliminating the wing has resulted in some nurses leaving for jobs elsewhere, including Kaiser Permanente Santa Rosa Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaiser, a members-only health care system, is the only other hospital in Sonoma County with an inpatient pediatrics unit. Sutter Santa Rosa Regional Hospital, the region’s other major hospital does not, nor do smaller hospitals in Healdsburg, Petaluma and Sonoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memorial Hospital’s pediatrics wing treated 507 children last year and more than 300 so far this year, according to the unit nurse. She said that while it’s true that pediatric patients often do not fill all the beds in the wing, the unit often takes some children who are recovering from surgery but do not stay overnight, as well as pediatric transfers from other hospitals in Northern California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nurse said that after Providence shut down the &lt;a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/2023/02/16/health-district-blasts-plans-to-close-petaluma-valley-hospitals-birth-center-after-contentious-meeting-2/"&gt;maternity ward at Petaluma Valley Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, “we’ve been doing a lot of overflow of mothers and newborns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Milana PeBenito, a local family medicine physician, sent a letter to the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors, alerting them to the possible closure of the inpatient pediatric wing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PeBenito said hospital operators in general are curtailing inpatient pediatric services. She said that preventive health initiatives, including flu and RSV vaccination, have annually reduced the number of sick children needing hospitalization. Meanwhile, “market forces of low reimbursement for pediatric care drive hospitals to close units that cannot pay for themselves,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PeBenito pointed out that Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital admits more than 400 children from Sonoma County and surrounding communities, with 85% of them are covered by federal Medicaid insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With the closure of (Memorial Hospital’s) pediatric unit, 240 children annually are projected to require transfer to the nearest inpatient pediatric hospital – in Oakland or San Francisco,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PeBenito told The Press Democrat Friday that Providence is under a great deal of financial pressure because a large share of its patients are either uninsured or covered by Medi-Cal, the state’s version of the federal Medicaid program. She said Medicaid cuts under Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill could further destabilize Providence and other local health care providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not entirely Providence’s fault,” PeBenito said. “Every single hospital is facing a dire outlook right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olney, in his statement this week, said Providence can’t “do everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we plan for the future, we recognize that we are not called to do everything, we are called to do what we can and do it well,” he said. “This may mean recognizing that a like-hearted organization is better positioned to deliver a program or service in our community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Providence said in a statement that the wing had 8 licensed beds, an average of two patients daily and that the majority of those patients are in the hospital for less than 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospital officials said that for more than 20 years, most pediatric patients who come to the hospital’s emergency department are not admitted at Memorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, they’re assessed, stabilized, and transferred to Memorial’s partner, UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital. Providence said in its statement Thursday no final decision has been made.&lt;/p&gt;

Loneliness changes our internal biology in ways that are linked to heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and even early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large study of more than 42,000 adults measured thousands of proteins in blood. The researchers mapped how loneliness and social isolation line up with immune system and metabolic pathways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work helps connect the dots between the social experience of loneliness, and concrete risks to our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have warned for years that weak social ties shorten lives. A landmark &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25910392/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that people who lack social connection have a higher risk of early death, even after accounting for other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Chun Shen from the &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;, examined what might sit in the middle of that pathway and leave a fingerprint in blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-loneliness-and-disease"&gt;Studying loneliness and disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/proteome-297/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;proteome&lt;/a&gt;, the full set of measurable proteins in blood, to see which signals rise or fall when people report objective social isolation or the subjective feeling of loneliness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After accounting for age, sex, income, education, smoking, alcohol use, and body mass index, 175 proteins tracked with social isolation and 26 tracked with loneliness, with notable overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To probe cause and effect, the researchers used &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_randomization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mendelian randomization&lt;/a&gt;. This method treats genetic variants as natural experiments to infer whether loneliness itself shifts protein levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That analysis pointed to five proteins with levels that appear to be driven by loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that social isolation and loneliness are linked to poorer health, but we’ve never understood why,” explained Shen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work has highlighted a number of proteins that appear to play a key role in this relationship, with levels of some proteins in particular increasing as a direct consequence of loneliness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-immunity-and-inflammation"&gt;Immunity and inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the proteins tied to weak social connection were part of immune responses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several related to antiviral activity, inflammatory signaling, and the complement system, which is a rapid response arm of immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that more than half of the proteins linked to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/loneliness-disrupts-college-students-sleep-more-than-screen-time/"&gt;isolation&lt;/a&gt; or loneliness predicted later risk of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-disease-remains-the-leading-cause-of-death-worldwide/"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, type 2 diabetes, stroke, or death over follow up. Those associations held even after careful adjustment for common confounders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One protein, adrenomedullin (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28150464/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ADM&lt;/a&gt;), stood out as a consistent mediator between loneliness and disease risk. Higher ADM was tied to greater risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and mortality in the cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is biological backing for ADM’s role in stress physiology and social signaling. In animal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19420012/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, central adrenomedullin peptides increased activity in oxytocin neurons and raised oxytocin levels in blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study linked higher ADM in blood to smaller volumes in brain regions that help sense internal body signals and shape emotion. That pattern offers a plausible route from a social feeling to a whole-body response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-loneliness-disease-and-the-brain"&gt;Loneliness, disease, and the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher levels of ADM were linked to smaller size in the insula, a brain area that helps the body sense and process internal signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were also connected to reduced size in the left caudate, which is important for emotion, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/want-to-stay-motivated-focus-on-time-not-money/"&gt;motivation&lt;/a&gt;, and social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These associations do not mean neurons are being lost due to loneliness. They do show a clear connection between a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/loneliness-harms-health-more-than-alcohol-obesity-or-smoking/"&gt;social experience&lt;/a&gt;, a circulating protein, and variation in brain structure measured years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another protein identified was &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1508419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ASGR1&lt;/a&gt;, which has been tied to cholesterol levels and heart disease. In people, a genetic change that turns off ASGR1 lowers certain types of cholesterol and cuts the risk of coronary artery disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work suggests that loneliness may nudge ASGR1 levels higher, adding a layer of social biology on top of known genetic effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is an intriguing connection to how arteries harden and why some people move toward insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-numbers-really-say"&gt;What the numbers really say&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study pointed to five proteins with levels that seemed to be directly affected by loneliness and were also tied to health problems. These proteins were ADM, ASGR1, GFRA1, FABP4, and TNFRSF10A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About nine in ten of the proteins tied to poor social connection were also associated with higher mortality risk in the dataset. More than half were tied to later cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic approaches such as Mendelian randomization strengthen causal arguments, but they are not perfect. Pleiotropy, where one genetic variant affects multiple traits, can blur the view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the convergence of genetic instruments, longitudinal health records, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/100-year-old-people-all-share-these-crucial-blood-biomarkers-that-short-lived-people-dont-have/"&gt;blood biomarkers&lt;/a&gt;, and brain imaging adds weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story that emerges is that persistent loneliness can change the mix of proteins that steer inflammation, metabolism, and stress. Those changes tack with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/poverty-linked-loneliness-causes-real-physical-and-emotional-pain/"&gt;poorer outcomes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-loneliness-as-a-global-pandemic"&gt;Loneliness as a global pandemic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness is not just a private struggle. The World Health Organization (&lt;a href="https://www.who.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;) has flagged social connection as a public health priority. They created a three-year Commission to push action, as noted in an official &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/15-11-2023-who-launches-commission-to-foster-social-connection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WHO news item&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That framing matters because the biology uncovered here points to preventable risk. Social connection is not a pill. It is a lever that can reduce the burden of cardiovascular and metabolic disease in populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians already track &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/c-reactive-protein-test/about/pac-20385228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;C-reactive protein&lt;/a&gt; and other biomarkers of inflammation when they assess metabolic and cardiovascular risk. It will take more work before proteins such as ADM or ASGR1 become clinical targets or routine tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even now, it is reasonable to treat persistent loneliness like a modifiable risk factor. As such, it deserves the same systematic attention as blood pressure or cholesterol. Health systems can screen for it, and community connections can lower it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-02078-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 22:51:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxNTlgzS3hXdTdoaUcxM3ZLOXhDQVFFQ0Z4eV9pZUZlN0lBZi1wMEhhNXoxQW82c2E5NjZtbDNnTFpGOEFlTzkwbWk1R0g5aFRlQ195TVRZRHdmQmpPMmNIc1hDX0tpcF9ITVpmangzZ2QycktYVmpKRnJGY3VXVW51QzdXQ05OWExRQUlfOVJ1aE14TnlfbWltUGRkUG1UcWZvYXdsMmJZaU13YXl6cTFnSHVyM2Jaa3RVQUZObkwwUzNIUU0</guid></item><item><title>最近的流感季节预计会很严重；医生敦促接种疫苗，包括FluMist作为无针选择- ABC7洛杉矶</title><link>https://abc7.com/post/latest-flu-season-expected-severe-doctors-urge-vaccination-including-flumist-needle-free-option/17789387/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB  "&gt;LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- &lt;/span&gt;If this year's &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="Needle-free"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; season is anything like the one they're having in Australia, we could be in for a severe one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This winter, infectious disease experts say hundreds and likely thousands of flu-related deaths can be prevented with the flu shot.

But what happens to this map when a body part is removed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/144/7/1929/6206526"&gt;scientists believed&lt;/a&gt; that when a body part is amputated, the brain’s body map dramatically reorganises itself, with neighbouring body parts taking over the area once represented by the missing limb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea of large-scale brain reorganisation became a central pillar of what neuroscientists call adult brain plasticity: the ability of the brain to change its structure and function in response to injuries, new experiences or training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our new study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02037-7"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, shows the opposite is true: the brain’s body map remains strikingly stable, even years after amputation.&lt;br&gt; To test what happens in the brain after a person loses a body part, we took a unique approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with NHS surgeons, we followed three adult patients who were preparing to undergo lifesaving arm amputations for medical reasons, such as cancer or severe problems with blood supply. We scanned their brains with functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before the amputation and repeatedly afterwards – in some cases for as long as five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the MRI scans, we asked patients to move different body parts: tapping their individual fingers, curling their toes or pursing their lips. This allowed us to map brain activity and to construct the brain’s body map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the surgery, we repeated the scans, this time asking them to move their missing (phantom) fingers. Phantom movements are not imaginary: most amputees continue to feel vivid sensations of their missing limbs, even though they are physically no longer there. Doing so gave us a rare opportunity to directly compare the brain’s hand map before and after amputation in the same person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discovered that, across all three patients, the map of the hand in the brain remained remarkably unchanged and did not get overwritten by other body parts, such as the face. This neural stability helps explain why so many amputees continue to feel their missing limbs so vividly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most amputees, however, phantom sensations are not neutral sensations; they are painful and described as burning, stabbing or itching. For years, the dominant explanation for these painful sensations came from the idea that the brain’s body map has reorganised itself. In turn, this theory inspired therapies such as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnPxKr1dMU0"&gt;mirror box therapy&lt;/a&gt;, virtual reality training, or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QplcT2MjuEc"&gt;sensory-discrimination exercises&lt;/a&gt;, all aimed at fixing supposedly broken maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings show the brain’s body map is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; broken. This helps explain why these therapies consistently fail to outperform placebo treatments in clinical trials. If the map remains intact, trying to fix it is a dead end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The real culprit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, our results suggest we should look elsewhere, for example, in the nerves that are cut during surgery. Severed nerves can form tangled clusters that misfire signals back to the brain. New amputation surgical techniques are being developed to preserve nerve signalling and maintain stable connections to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings have important implications for developing prosthetic limbs and brain-computer interfaces. Invasive next-generation brain-computer interfaces can tap directly into the preserved map of the amputated body part to decode what movements are being attempted or even deliver electrical stimulation to the map to enable amputees to feel their missing limb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These technologies are in development and could, one day, restore natural and intuitive control and sensations of a prosthetic limb, by using the preserved body map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results show that our brains have a resilient model of the body that maintains the representations, even when the sensory input is lost. For amputees, this means that the missing limb lives on in the brain, sometimes as a source of discomfort, but also as a resource for future technologies to use.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263547/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263547/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

Using electroencephalography (EEG), the researchers tracked how different components of the technique influenced brain activity and found that rhythmic breathing gradually shifted brain dynamics into a relaxed meditative state characterized by theta and delta rhythms, reduced alpha power, and a decrease in non-repeating brain signals known as aperiodic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was motivated by a growing need for accessible mental health interventions. Across the globe, people are facing rising rates of depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders. At the same time, access to trained mental health professionals remains limited. These challenges have prompted researchers to investigate low-cost, scalable practices like yoga, meditation, and controlled breathing. Techniques such as Sudarshan Kriya Yoga have already demonstrated benefits for people with conditions ranging from PTSD to hypertension. However, the underlying brain mechanisms during the practice remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sudarshan Kriya Yoga combines specific postures, multiple forms of breath control, and guided meditation in a sequence designed to promote physical and emotional well-being. Previous studies have noted changes in EEG patterns following yoga practice, but few have examined how brain activity shifts during the technique’s distinct stages. The new study aimed to fill this gap by recording and analyzing EEG signals before, during, and after each component of the yoga sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have been practicing meditation for about 16 years now. I have been curious as to what happens to the brain when one meditates which has led me to explore the neuroscience of meditation using tools like EEG/fMRI etc. Breathwork allows for an easier transition to a deeper meditative state. I was interested to know how that would happen, so along with the team at the Sri Sri Institute of Advanced Research we analyzed the brain dynamics during a guided breath based meditation paradigm,” said study author Vaibhav Tripathi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research involved 43 regular practitioners of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga, most of whom had years of experience with the technique. The participants were recruited from a yoga and meditation center in India and asked to follow the standard Sudarshan Kriya Yoga routine while seated, with EEG recordings taken throughout the session. A separate control group of ten participants listened to calming music for the same duration, allowing the researchers to compare the effects of the breathing practice with those of passive relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The yoga protocol included several phases: initial breathing exercises (pranayama), bhastrika (a more vigorous breath technique), om chanting, cyclical breathing (kriya), and a meditative resting phase called yoga-nidra. To ensure signal consistency, participants remained seated throughout and were guided by a prerecorded audio track. The researchers focused their analysis on five main time periods: resting before the practice, pranayama, kriya, yoga-nidra, and a post-session resting period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EEG data were collected from 24 channels across the scalp. Using advanced signal processing tools, the researchers extracted specific features from the EEG data, including the amplitude, frequency, and width of delta, theta, and alpha brain waves. They also measured the slope of aperiodic activity, which reflects more spontaneous, non-rhythmic electrical patterns. These measures were statistically compared across the five phases of the meditation session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study revealed distinct patterns of brain activity linked to different phases of the Sudarshan Kriya Yoga technique. During the kriya phase, there was a noticeable increase in theta wave activity, particularly in brain areas associated with attention and emotional regulation. This pattern remained elevated through the subsequent yoga-nidra phase. Theta rhythms have been associated with relaxed alertness and internal focus in prior research, which may help explain the meditative effects observed during Sudarshan Kriya Yoga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, alpha wave activity—a marker typically linked to sensory processing and alertness—declined sharply during the yoga-nidra period. This drop was especially prominent in parietal and occipital regions of the brain, which process visual and sensory information. The reduction in alpha amplitude and bandwidth may reflect a shift toward a less externally focused and more internally absorbed mental state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also documented a rise in delta wave activity during the yoga-nidra stage. Delta waves are typically associated with deep sleep and unconscious processes, but can also appear during states of deep meditation. The increase in delta power suggests that the final stages of the yoga technique guide the brain into a profoundly relaxed state that resembles the early phases of sleep but with preserved awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these changes, the study found a decrease in aperiodic activity, particularly during the yoga-nidra and post-resting phases. This flattening of the EEG spectrum suggests reduced random or non-repeating brain activity, possibly indicating a quieter and more stable mental state. These shifts were not observed in the control group, suggesting that the EEG changes were specific to the breath-based practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, although the participants varied in how long they had been practicing yoga, the researchers did not find significant differences in brain activity based on experience level. This suggests that even among experienced practitioners, the practice induces consistent brain changes across individuals. Notably, the deepest meditative states, marked by delta-theta dominance and reduced alpha and aperiodic activity, occurred during the yoga-nidra phase, suggesting that the full sequence of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga builds toward a specific neurological outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that rhythmic breathing practice like Sudarshan Kriya Yoga allows an easier access to a deep state of meditation,” Tripathi told PsyPost. “EEG from participants were recorded before, during and after they were practicing the technique. EEG records brain activity which can be quantified into different rhythms like alpha, beta, theta, delta and gamma. What we found was that the breathing activated the theta rhythms in the brain which allowed a practitioner to easily transition to a relaxed state with heightened theta-delta activity. This activity is somewhere between fully awake (alpha/beta dominant) to fully asleep (slow waves and delta dominant), suggesting that the practitioner is in a relaxed yet aware state which traditional texts of meditation have referred to as Turiya (fourth state of consciousness, the others being sleeping, awake and dreaming).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study provides new insights into the neurophysiological effects of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga meditation, it is not without limitations. The researchers relied on qualitative self-reports to assess relaxation rather than formal mood or state questionnaires. More precise behavioral and physiological measures—such as heart rate variability or cortisol levels—could strengthen future studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the current research focused on experienced practitioners. It remains unclear whether the same EEG patterns would emerge in beginners or how long it might take for such changes to develop. Including novices in future research could help clarify how yoga influences brain rhythms over time and whether these changes correlate with psychological improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’d like to extend this line of research to understand how different meditative practices affect the brain rhythms and if there are variations across individuals,” Tripathi said. “We would also like to categorize how the experience of meditation differs across days within the same individual and if we can find brain signals that respond to these variations. The long term goal is to have a clear biomarker of different stages of meditation which can be observed using accessible devices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44184-025-00156-4" target="_blank"&gt;Unlocking deep relaxation: the power of rhythmic breathing on brain rhythms&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Vaibhav Tripathi, Lakshmi Bhaskar, Chhaya Kharya, Manvir Bhatia, and Vinod Kochupillai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 22:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxNenZXcWRWb1EtZGVIUXlZZ3BfdjZoRW5uOGlvT2k4aFplZEhUMGFjRmlnQ3l4LTlWQS1vMmxBNnlfeDZYVml1U05fa3U0c0d1RHAwYnYxcHpWbE1fWWlZQnMxS2F5dzFNYk9DZGtqdE1TV3ZUTGxqWFRlclNoQjdrSkZiYnNDUUdfUzcwVEpRTkdteHFlZ0NkNm5RNWg5NDdEVHJHVVJtaFdZZ2tORHc</guid></item><item><title>Cassidy呼吁RFK Jr.在疫情爆发期间公开支持百日咳疫苗- yahoo.com</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/cassidy-calls-rfk-jr-publicly-213950934.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sen.

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — Federal health officials intend to award a contract to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to investigate whether there is a link between vaccinations and autism, according to a government procurement notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Troy, New York, engineering school is getting the no-bid contract because of its “unique ability” to link data on children and mothers, according to the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://sam.gov/workspace/contract/opp/280398e7b4b54c0fac7de5efcbb80a80/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;notice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; posted this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to questions about the notice, including how much the contract is for or what exactly the researchers intend to do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading voice in the antivaccine movement before President Donald Trump selected him to oversee federal health agencies, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/autism-kennedy-trump-vaccines-rfk-jr-cdc-b66251888f039c80b15beda23c279d5b"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in April a “massive testing and research effort” to determine the cause of &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/autism"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by this month. He has repeatedly &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-jr-trump-health-maha-pharma-autism-55db3f5c14a6e3a2aef2483d21ac679b"&gt;tried to link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; vaccines to the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;An RPI biotech engineering professor, Juergen Hahn, has used artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.hahnresearchgroup.com/news" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;to look for patterns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in blood samples of children with autism. Hahn “is renowned for the quality and rigor of his research,” RPI officials said in a statement acknowledging the intended grant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If this project is awarded, he intends to publish the results of his work at the conclusion of the project,” the statement added.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press left messages seeking comment from Hahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notice raises many questions, said Alycia Halladay, who oversees research activities and grants for the Autism Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RPI is not known in the field as having any special access to data on this kind of question and “wouldn’t be the obvious choice,” Halladay said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also not clear how the contract fits into other autism research that the government may be planning, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the biggest question is why money is being spent on such a study at all, she added.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have ruled out a link between vaccines and autism, finding no evidence of increased rates of autism among those who are vaccinated compared with those who are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The question has been studied for 20 years, multiple times by researchers around the world using millions of people, and there has never been a credible association found between vaccines and autism,” Halladay said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who have spent decades researching autism &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/autism-kennedy-rfk-science-e4a5795275042c29e4a5721b2b163970"&gt;have found no single cause&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Genetics play a role, and other factors include the age of a child’s father, the mother’s weight, and whether she had diabetes or was exposed to certain chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever amount is being spent on the project could instead be going to “other important research questions,” including studies of genetics and environmental factors, Halladay said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that’s the most frustrating part,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For months, HHS officials have been trying to use vaccine safety data compiled by the CDC to look for harms that might be tied to shots. Kennedy has accused CDC leaders of stonewalling those efforts, but the actual obstacle has been something else, said one former federal health official familiar with the situation, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;About a dozen medical research organizations collect the vaccine safety data and report it to the CDC. Contracts that stretch back nearly two decades give those entities — not the CDC — control over the data, and HHS has not yet been able to get it, the official said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

For someone at high risk for AFib, that short circuit can be triggered by anything from overconsumption of alcohol to high blood pressure or sleep apnea.

"It also carries a three times increased risk for heart failure and a two times risk for dementia,” adds Hayes. This is why it’s critical to heed any warning signs to get the condition under control. Unfortunately, those red flags can be vague and intermittent, and all too easy to ignore or discount. “Atrial fibrillation is often confused for anxiety, stress, or a panic attack. You may also think it’s all in your head,” says &lt;a href="https://www.drmarthagulati.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Martha Gulati, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Martha Gulati, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist at Smitdt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA. Not only are AFib symptoms easy to miss, one of the most common and surprising things about the condition is that you can have no symptoms at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What puts you at higher risk for A-fib? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age is the most important (and the least modifiable) risk factor for atrial fibrillation. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6880740/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:AFib affects up to 9% of U.S. adults;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;AFib affects up to 9% of U.S. adults&lt;/a&gt; between the ages of 60 and 80. But aging is not the only cause. So is high blood pressure, diabetes (types 1 and 2), obesity, smoking, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9561500/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:alcohol use;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;alcohol use&lt;/a&gt;, an overactive thyroid, and obstructive sleep apnea. “While AFib is less common in people under the age of 60, these other causes may put you at risk, but most of them are treatable with medication or lifestyle changes,” says Hayes. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 Warning Signs of Atrial Fibrillation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart palpitations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Feeling your heart fluttering or beating rapidly is the most common sign of AFib,” says Gulati. “This arrhythmia can be described as your heart racing, or flip-flopping, or pounding. It can come at any time, when you’re exercising, or at rest, or even when you’re sleeping, and the feeling can come and go.” Not all palpitations are atrial fibrillation or dangerous, but if you notice irregular heartbeats and fluttering, cardiologists want you to be on the safe side and get checked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fatigue and weakness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may start noticing that you tire easily or faster than usual when exercising. “I have an older patient who is spry and in overall good health but who felt he was slowing down and getting worn out easily, and he was diagnosed with AFib,” says Hayes. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arrhythmia can cause difficulty breathing during normal activities or even at rest. “This symptom can be easily confused with many things, including a panic attack or anxiety,” says Gulati. “If you feel that something is different, or new, or just doesn’t feel right, go see your doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dizziness and feeling light-headed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An irregular heartbeat can lead to dizzy spells, light-headedness or even fainting. These SOS signals may seem random or dismissed as dehydration, exhaustion, or anemia but cardiologists urge you to take anything out of the ordinary seriously and see your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chest pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could be anything from a sharp pain or tightness in the chest to a feeling of heartburn, and it can come and go,” says Gulati. This is why patients often think they’re just making it up, or it’s just a random incident. The bottom line: “If you have any kind of chest pain or discomfort, it could be your heart and it needs to be evaluated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An underlying medical condition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have been diagnosed with a condition like hypertension, sleep apnea, or an overactive thyroid you are at higher risk for AFib and should have your doctor evaluate you. “If you’ve had a heart attack before, or if you have a sibling or a parent who had AFib early in life, then you should also be evaluated and monitored,” says Hayes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No symptoms at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s estimated that about 40% of people with atrial fibrillation are entirely asymptomatic,” says Hayes, “and this is very consistent with my medical experience. It’s not that you can miss the signs, it’s that you don’t notice any. These are the people I worry about because their AFib may be hidden, and it could cause a stroke.” This is termed &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6660167/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:‘silent atrial fibrillation’;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;‘silent atrial fibrillation’&lt;/a&gt; because there are no warning signs. “This is why it’s so critical to keep up with annual physical exams and medical appointments, especially if you’re over 50,” says Hayes, “because hopefully they’ll pick up on any irregularity when checking your heart rate and blood pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to see a doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have any of these symptoms, or if you have an underlying condition such as hypertension, get checked out by your primary care physician. Even something as simple as taking your blood pressure or listening to your heart during a physical can lead your doctor to pick up on a problem. (“You can also track your heart rate on an Apple watch &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.060291" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:or a Fitbit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;or a Fitbit&lt;/a&gt;, and it can detect potential atrial fibrillation, even if you feel healthy and have no symptoms,” says Hayes. The good news about these devices is that they can lead you to see a doctor.) If you are diagnosed with AFib, there are medications, such as blood thinners and beta blockers to slow the heart rate, and effective treatments that can markedly reduce the risk of a stroke and can save your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 20:24:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxPN2J0LWF2Z0xKVEZVVkdMa3ZqNWFfZzlXcmdBYzE5am5BVHpqVm0xNlpjQWZ0TDBCZU5XbU9Hckg0RVpGY0d5ektsMVhGaFp1QnRyTVozb1FOM1Bnb09GTWNMa1g2X24xc2pTZEVROFRjT3RrXzk5ZHBLYzNVQTlwR2lyVllqQ3l3QkE</guid></item><item><title>这些州正在采取措施，以方便获得COVID-19疫苗- PBS</title><link>https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/these-states-are-taking-steps-to-ease-access-to-covid-19-vaccines</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-text"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;The governors of Arizona, Illinois, Maine and North Carolina on Friday joined the growing list of Democratic officials who have signed orders intended to ensure most residents can receive COVID-19 vaccines at pharmacies without individual prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike past years, access to COVID-19 vaccines has become complicated in 2025, largely because federal guidance does not recommend them for nearly everyone this year as it had in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at where things stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pharmacy chain says the shots are available in most states without individual prescriptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVS Health, the biggest pharmacy chain in the U.S., says its stores are offering the shots without an individual prescription in 41 states as of midday Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the remaining states — Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, North Carolina, Oregon, Utah and West Virginia, plus the District of Columbia — require individual prescriptions under the company’s interpretation of state policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arizona, Maine and North Carolina are likely to come off that list as the new orders take effect there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will not stand idly by while the Trump Administration makes it harder for Maine people to get a vaccine that protects their health and could very well save their life,” Maine Gov. Janet Mills said in the statement. “Through this standing order, we are stepping up to knock down the barriers the Trump Administration is putting in the way of the health and welfare of Maine people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Democratic governors have been taking action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 14 states — 12 with Democratic governors, plus Virginia, where Republican Glenn Youngkin is governor — have announced policies this month to ease access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some of the states that have expanded access — including Delaware and New Jersey earlier in the week and Illinois on Friday — at least some pharmacies were already providing the shots broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/fact-checking-rfk-jr-s-claim-that-everybody-can-get-the-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;Fact-checking RFK Jr.’s claim that ‘everybody can get’ the COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday’s orders are expected to change the policy in all three states where they were put into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Carolina’s orders were narrower than most. They apply to everyone age 65 and over and people who are at least 18 and have a risk factor. Other adults would still need prescriptions. Officials said the order takes effect immediately, but that all pharmacies might not have supplies on hand right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WATCH: &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/epidemiologist-breaks-down-new-restrictions-on-covid-shots"&gt;Epidemiologist breaks down new restrictions on COVID shots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most Republican-controlled states have not changed vaccine policy this month, the inoculations are still available there under existing policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the round of orders from governors, boards of pharmacy and other officials, four states — California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington — have announced an alliance to make their own vaccine recommendations. Of those, only Oregon doesn’t currently allow the shots in pharmacies without individual prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vaccines have become politically contentious&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In past years, the federal government has recommended the vaccines to all Americans above the age of 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved them for people age 65 and over but said they should be used only for children and younger adults who have a risk factor such as asthma or obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

Graphic by Jenna Cohen/PBS News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That change came as U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy fired the entire Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in June, accusing of them of being too closely aligned with the companies that make the vaccines. The replacements include vaccine skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, framed her order Friday as “protecting the health care freedom” of people in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One state has taken another stance on vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida’s surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, announced this month that the state could become the first to eliminate requirements that children have a list of vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, though, the state health department said that the change likely wouldn’t take effect until December and that without legislative action, only some vaccines — including for chickenpox — would become optional. The measles and polio shots would remain mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Associated Press writer Patrick Whittle in Maine contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Texas is seeing an explosion of cases of typhus, a disease that – if untreated – can be fatal. Typhus was almost eradicated from the United States, but now it's making a comeback.&lt;/p&gt;   
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Typhus is a disease many thought was a thing of the past. Now, it's making a comeback. Health officials are reporting a rise in cases, especially in Texas. As Texas Public Radio's David Martin Davies reports, it's taken many by surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF ORGAN PLAYING)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVID MARTIN DAVIES, BYLINE: When Dana Clark plays her antique parlor organ these days, it takes extra effort. While vigorously driving the foot bellows, she fingers the black and white keys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DANA CLARK: My great-grandmother's pump organ - it's a hundred and twenty years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: In May, 76-year-old Clark contracted typhus from clearing weeds from her garden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLARK: I created a lot of dust, and just inhaling that dust can give someone typhus because flea excrement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Days after exposure, symptoms often begin with high fever, headache and body aches. A rash can also appear, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When treated promptly with antibiotics, outcomes are usually good. But delayed diagnosis increases the risk of complications and hospitalization. That's what happened to Clark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GREGORY ANSTEAD: It's still not an extremely well-known disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Dr. Gregory Anstead is a San Antonio-based infectious disease specialist. He has conducted extensive research into the resurgence of flea-borne typhus in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANSTEAD: In the 1990s, there were only about 200 cases in the state of Texas. 2010 to 2019, the number of cases went up 12-fold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: The number of typhus cases is climbing in Texas, California and Hawaii. In Los Angeles County, for example, typhus cases rose from 31 in 2010 to 171 in 2022. Because the disease had been so rare, the CDC doesn't track typhus cases, but historically, it was a common scourge. In the 1940s, it was so widespread in San Antonio that the city was used as an experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Health authorities of the city of San Antonio, Texas, attacked the germ carrier throughout the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANSTEAD: The U.S. Public Health Service took, you know, several tons of DDT. They spread it to 22,000 rooms in urban San Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: This citywide anti-typhus blitz worked. The number of typhus cases dropped, and the war against typhus fleas and rats spread across the South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANSTEAD: The combination of insecticide treatment with DDT and also spreading these new rodenticides, you know, definitely interrupted this transmission cycle of typhus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: But now typhus is back. Climate change is creating better conditions for the malady. Fleas and typhus bacteria thrive in the warmer temperatures. Rat populations are also booming due to a warming climate. A study recently published in Science Advances finds rat numbers are up in cities, including Washington, D.C., and New York, all of which fuels transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLARK: It's been a long ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF PIANO PLAYING)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Clark is back to playing the piano and giving music lessons. She recommends people wear an N95 mask while pulling weeds to avoid breathing in typhus-infected dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For NPR News, I'm David Martin Davies in San Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;A North Raleigh park once plagued with mosquitoes lurking along
a shaded tree line saw a bite-free summer after testing new technology.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“In years past, we would get nonstop complaints of ‘I’ve got
mosquitoes along the walking path,’” said Tanner Hardee, who has overseen landscaping
at Cokesbury Park for several years with the company Yardnique. “This year, we haven’t
gotten a single one.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Eight Biogents traps, camouflaged along the park’s tree line
are responsible for the reduction in bites.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The German-based company -- with a U.S. base in Cary -- installed
the traps three months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We’ve effectively caught over a million mosquitos,” said
Biogents USA President John Anderson. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The females caught by the traps alone are estimated to
reduce future mosquito population around the park by over 7 million.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The devices use pesticide-free technology. They lure mosquitoes with a small attractant that’s chemically engineered to mimic the scent of a human. &lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/family/no-mosquito-park-eco-friendly-traps-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“There is a specific design to the traps,” Anderson
explained. “They push out airflow – it’s a circular air flow – and it has CO2 attached
to it. The airflow pattern is what mimics a human.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The airflow pulls the mosquitoes inside the trap, and they
cannot escape.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Anderson shared the cone-shaped traps used in the parks only
attract mosquitoes, leaving other important pollinators and wildlife unharmed.
Smaller circular traps are also available for at-home use, and they don’t require professional
maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“In the rest of the world, insecticides are banned more so
than the U.S.,” Anderson told WRAL. “In the rest of the world, Biogents has
been doing this for 20 years. What we want to do is take that here in the
United States and show people there is a better way to do this than just
fogging or insecticide spraying.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The traps may also offer homeowners cost savings. Terminix
Triad reports &lt;a href="https://www.terminix-triad.com/our-blog/how-much-does-pest-control-cost-north-carolina/#:~:text=Ongoing%20pest%20control%20plans.,automatic%20charges%20after%20each%20service."&gt;ongoing
pest control plans&lt;/a&gt; in North Carolina range from $300-$1,600 per year.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/family/no-mosquito-park-eco-friendly-traps-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/family/no-mosquito-park-eco-friendly-traps-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The Biogents at-home traps and attractants sold on Amazon
are listed for less than $300. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Beyond comfort, experts say the approach could have public
health implications. Trapped mosquitoes in Biogents devices can be analyzed to
determine whether they carry viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The company has worked internationally to mitigate the
spread of mosquito-borne illnesses, including dengue fever, in places like Asia,
Africa and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;In July, Durham reported &lt;a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/2025/07/30/ncdhhs-announces-first-west-nile-case-2025"&gt;North
Carolina’s first case of West Nile virus in 2025&lt;/a&gt;. Infected mosquitoes were also
detected in Pitt County.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Local homeowners Victoria Blacik and Clinton Adams told WRAL
they have noticed fewer pests along the park’s walkway.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We walk through most evenings,” Blacik said. “I haven’t
been bitten by mosquitoes that I can remember walking through here recently, so
it’s doing its job.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;She added, “Sometimes people do mosquito-spraying in their yard,
and I know that works, but it’s pesticides. It’s nice they found a solution
that doesn’t involve pesticides like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Adams said the couple was “completely oblivious” to the
traps because they were so quiet and hidden in the trees. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Biogents said the summer success at Cokesbury Park has helped
fuel a plan with NCDHHS to roll the tech out to more public spaces statewide. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We met with them last week,” Anderson said. “We’re
looking at how do we implement this into almost 40 counties here in North
Carolina for next year.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaiser Permanente, the largest private health insurer in California, has &lt;a href="https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/northern-california/health-wellness/coronavirus-information/vaccine-appointments"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it will make Covid-19 vaccinations available for free to all of its members over 6 months of age. The provider expects to have the new 2025-2026 vaccine in stock starting on Sept. 15.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The decision, the insurer said in a statement, “is based on the latest scientific evidence and clinical guidance from our physician experts and many other sources, including leading medical societies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy is in stark contrast with that of the federal Food and Drug Administration, which &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-narrows-under-65-covid-vaccine-eligibility-maintains-full-access-older-2025-08-27/"&gt;approved the new 2025-2026 vaccine&lt;/a&gt; only for people 65 years or older or who have an underlying condition such as diabetes or lung disease that puts them at risk of serious illness or death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal data shows &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/EL8P-32Q2"&gt;most people&lt;/a&gt; in the United States get their vaccines from a pharmacy. Major chains such as &lt;a href="https://www.walgreens.com/topic/promotion/covid-vaccine.jsp?&amp;amp;ext=gooFY-26_LB-VACC_CH-SEARCH_CN-VACC_COVID+Vaccine_CA-BOS_MT-TXT_LG-EN1_RE-NA_MK-GM_OB-STRVISIT_PK-STRVISIT-KT-BRAND_AS-GOOFY-26_AS-GOO_FF-VACC_COVID+Vaccine_Brand_Booster_DT-NA_LG-EN1_MT-GM_SA-TP_SI-NA_TC-KEY_PB-GO_PK-STRVISIT_walgreens%20covid%20booster&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=21594923034&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD7MwhQ6Zwjwr7cJDqQ5_MlNeInsw&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw5onGBhDeARIsAFK6QJYle6TmhpgVimaUgkywPoT7N4EBNwhd84_b45T0ooa-TzzBCkKptj8aAtBTEALw_wcB"&gt;Walgreens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cvs.com/immunizations/covid-19-vaccine"&gt;CVS&lt;/a&gt; say they currently offer free vaccinations only to insured customers who fit within the new FDA guidelines. Berkeleyans younger than 65 may be able to get Covid vaccinations by paying out of pocket, but the cost ranges from &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/php/awardees/current-cdc-vaccine-price-list.html"&gt;$142&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to &lt;a href="https://www.cvs.com/immunizations/covid-19-vaccine"&gt;$250&lt;/a&gt;, the top price listed by CVS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Health continues to recommend that Covid vaccines be offered to everyone aged 6 months or older and is working with Oregon and Washington, through the new &lt;a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/03/california-oregon-and-washington-to-launch-new-west-coast-health-alliance-to-uphold-scientific-integrity-in-public-health-as-trump-destroys-cdcs-credibility/"&gt;West Coast Health Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, ​to further promote vaccine access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.chcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/HealthInsurersAlmanac2024.pdf"&gt;8.5 million Californians&lt;/a&gt; get their health coverage through Kaiser Permanente. Kaiser will offer vaccinations at its Berkeley Medical Offices, at 2621 Tenth St., and other locations.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;The governors of Arizona, Illinois, Maine and North Carolina on Friday joined the growing list of Democratic officials who have signed orders intended to ensure most residents can receive COVID-19 vaccines at pharmacies without individual prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike past years, access to COVID-19 vaccines has become complicated in 2025, largely because &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-19-vaccine-insurance-coverage-pharmacists-16b166a86548b37849eff2debc6e6100"&gt;federal guidance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; does not recommend them for nearly everyone this year as it had in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at where things stand.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Pharmacy chain says the shots are available in most states without individual prescriptions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVS Health, the biggest pharmacy chain in the U.S., says its stores are offering the shots without an individual prescription in 41 states as of midday Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the remaining states — Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, North Carolina, Oregon, Utah and West Virginia, plus the District of Columbia — require individual prescriptions under the company’s interpretation of state policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona, Maine and North Carolina are likely to come off that list as the new orders take effect there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I will not stand idly by while the Trump Administration makes it harder for Maine people to get a vaccine that protects their health and could very well save their life,” Maine Gov. Janet Mills said in the statement. “Through this standing order, we are stepping up to knock down the barriers the Trump Administration is putting in the way of the health and welfare of Maine people.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;Democratic governors have been taking action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 14 states — 12 with Democratic governors, plus Virginia, where Republican Glenn Youngkin is governor — have announced policies this month to ease access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some of the states that have expanded access — including Delaware and New Jersey earlier in the week and Illinois on Friday — at least some pharmacies were already providing the shots broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday’s orders are expected to change the policy in all three states where they were put into place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Carolina’s orders were narrower than most. They apply to everyone age 65 and over and people who are at least 18 and have a risk factor. Other adults would still need prescriptions. Officials said the order takes effect immediately, but that all pharmacies might not have supplies on hand right away.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;While most Republican-controlled states have not changed vaccine policy this month, the inoculations are still available there under existing policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the round of orders from governors, boards of pharmacy and other officials, four states — California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington — have announced an alliance to make their own &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-west-coast-vaccines-trump-fd5ce557532a3c9f37b77ff9f14b07b9"&gt;vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Of those, only Oregon doesn’t currently allow the shots in pharmacies without individual prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccines have become politically contentious&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In past years, the federal government has recommended the vaccines to all Americans above the age of 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved them for people age 65 and over but said they should be used only for children and younger adults who have a risk factor such as asthma or obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That change came as U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-cdc-acip-vaccines-3790c89f45b6314c5c7b686db0e3a8f9"&gt;fired the entire Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in June, accusing of them of being too closely aligned with the companies that make the vaccines. The &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76"&gt;replacements include vaccine skeptics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, framed her order Friday as “protecting the health care freedom” of people in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;One state has taken another stance on vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florida’s surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, announced this month that the state could become the first to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/florida-vaccine-mandates-desantis-schools-health-38688345e8d2cac6ecc6e92f3babe0f8"&gt;eliminate requirements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that children have a list of vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, though, the state health department said that the change likely &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/florida-vaccine-mandates-children-4e697db6085dc5dd4bd9b206ed9a51b6"&gt;wouldn’t take effect until December&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and that without legislative action, only some vaccines — including for chickenpox — would become optional. The measles and polio shots would remain mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associated Press writer Patrick Whittle in Maine contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;

Dr. Greenblatt, North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) Chief Medical Officer and State Health Director, has now issued &lt;a href="https://www.dph.ncdhhs.gov/about-us/nc-state-health-director-standing-orders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Standing Orders&lt;/a&gt; that allow seniors 65 years or older and adults over 18 years who meet certain criteria to get a COVID-19 vaccine at a pharmacy without having to get a prescription from a provider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Health care providers and pharmacists recommend vaccination as a safe and effective tool to protect yourself and your community from COVID-19,” &lt;strong&gt;said Governor Josh Stein. &lt;/strong&gt;“This action ensures that North Carolinians most at risk who want protection from COVID-19 can get it as we enter the cold and flu season.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Requiring an office visit to obtain a prescription to receive the COVID-19 vaccine is an administrative barrier for patients, providers, and pharmacies,” &lt;strong&gt;said Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai.&lt;/strong&gt; “Vaccinations against seasonal respiratory viruses, including flu, RSV, and COVID are especially important and the right choice for those at higher risk of severe viral respiratory disease.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, North Carolina had more than 120,000 emergency department visits for COVID-like illness, resulting in more than 21,600 hospitalizations. Vaccines remain an important part of overall health and well-being and are one of the most effective means available to prevent severe illness, hospitalization, and death. They help protect the health of children and adults, their families, and entire communities from the spread of infectious diseases. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the next round of COVID-19 vaccines in late August, and the Standing Order aligns with those federal recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per state law, immunizing pharmacists in North Carolina are permitted to administer vaccines that the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends, but the committee has not yet given its recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines this season. Without ACIP recommendations, immunizing pharmacists in North Carolina may only administer COVID-19 vaccines for those ages 18 and up with a prescription. With the Standing Order, adults over age 65 or with increased risk for severe COVID-19 can get the COVID-19 vaccine at a local pharmacy without having to visit a health care provider first. The Standing Order will serve as a prescription for immunizing pharmacists to administer COVID-19 vaccines to adults for whom the FDA has already approved the vaccine. For children ages six months to 17 years, parents should talk to their pediatricians, family physicians, or health care providers about vaccine availability. The Standing Order will increase access to care for millions of people in North Carolina who want to get a COVID-19 vaccine. According to NCDHHS, more than 70% of COVID-19 doses in North Carolina were given at pharmacies last year, showing those facilities are an important point of access for those who want the COVID-19 vaccine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The North Carolina Retail Merchants Association supports allowing North Carolinians 18 and older who choose to receive a COVID vaccine to get it at their local pharmacy without a prescription in accordance with recently issued FDA guidelines. We also applaud the decision to let patients continue to choose receiving both flu and COVID vaccines at their local pharmacies, underscoring the vital role pharmacies play in community healthcare. This order reduces confusion and brings North Carolina in line with the policies in place in the overwhelmingly majority of other states.”&lt;strong&gt; - Andy Ellen, NCRMA President and General Counsel &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines are the most effective public health tool to prevent the spread of a broad range of contagious illnesses including COVID-19. The NCAFP supports the Governor’s efforts to ensure safe and appropriate access to COVID-19 vaccines, be it from a physician or a pharmacist. We must all work together to protect our communities against the spread of COVID-19 infection.” &lt;strong&gt;- Dr. Mark McNeill, MD, FAAFP, President of the North Carolina Academy of Family Physicians  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The important steps taken today by the Governor and Dr. Greenblatt will save lives by improving access to vaccines.” &lt;strong&gt;– Dr. John Meier, MD, President of the North Carolina Medical Society &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Old North State Medical Society strongly endorses Governor Stein’s vaccination order. It fully aligns with our mission to promote health equity for the most vulnerable communities in North Carolina. Easier access for patients and reduced administrative obstacles for providers will make more vaccinations possible for underserved populations who face geographic, economic, or transportation challenges in obtaining preventive care.” &lt;strong&gt;– Dr. Wesley Ibazebo, MD, President of the Old North State Medical Society &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Internal medicine physicians across North Carolina applaud the action of our state public health leaders and Governor Stein to increase the ability for our most vulnerable adult patients to receive the 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccine in their neighborhood pharmacies. By removing access barriers to this crucial vaccine, we are facilitating the health of our patients and our communities.” &lt;strong&gt;- Dr. Marion M. McCrary, MD, FACP, FAMWA, Governor, American College of Physicians North Carolina chapter &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Carolina is currently one of &lt;a href="https://commonhealthcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-2026-COVID-19-Vaccine-Availability-by-State.pdfhttps://commonhealthcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-2026-COVID-19-Vaccine-Availability-by-State.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;10 states&lt;/a&gt; where, without ACIP recommendations, immunizing pharmacists can give the COVID-19 vaccine to people of certain age groups only if they have a prescription. The Standing Order aligns North Carolina with the vast majority of states where people do not need a prescription to get the COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Order will align with the FDA’s Aug. 27, 2025, approval indicating the COVID-19 vaccine for: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All people 65 years of age and older. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Individuals 18 and older who have at least one high-risk condition. This is a broad list that includes high-risk conditions such as obesity, asthma, diabetes, physical inactivity, depression, former or current smoking, and pregnancy, among many other conditions.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you think you may be eligible, you can view the list of risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection on the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/risk-factors/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CDC’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most pharmacies already have the updated 2025-2026 COVID-19 vaccine available, but since the seasonal vaccine formulations were recently approved by FDA, it may not yet be available at all locations. People should call their pharmacy of choice to see if they have COVID-19 vaccines available and make an appointment if needed. You should bring your insurance card if you have one and be prepared to answer a few simple questions, like how old you are or whether you have a qualifying condition. NCDHHS is continuing to work with partners to maximize the availability of COVID-19 vaccines for individuals who want the vaccine and would benefit from its protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, the following retail pharmacies have announced they have the updated COVID-19 vaccine available: Brisson Drugs, Carlie C’s, Central Pharmacy of Durham, Costco, CVS Pharmacy, Food Lion, Hope Mills Pharmacy Fairmont Drug Company, Ingles Markets, Med Smart Pharmacy, Med Source Pharmacy, Publix Pharmacies, Sam’s Club, Walgreens, and Walmart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This a partial list of pharmacies available to provide COVID vaccines. If you do not see your pharmacy’s name on this list, please reach out to confirm they are administering vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP recommendations are expected later in September, and federal guidance may continue to evolve. As this happens, North Carolina will do everything it can to ensure people have access to safe and affordable COVID-19 vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals, including parents, should talk with their health care provider or their child’s health care provider about the benefits and any concerns regarding seasonal vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccine. NCDHHS also has a &lt;a href="https://www.dph.ncdhhs.gov/programs/epidemiology/immunization/providers/education-and-resources/for-patients" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;bilingual childhood vaccinations toolkit&lt;/a&gt; in English and Spanish for providers to help individuals, parents, and providers have conversations about the importance of vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contract — which supports research to “investigate the association between vaccination and autism prevalence” —&lt;a href="https://sam.gov/workspace/contract/opp/280398e7b4b54c0fac7de5efcbb80a80/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; will be awarded to&lt;/a&gt; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, should the contract be finalized.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The contract is sole-source, meaning institutions did not formally compete for the funding, usually because one institution is believed to be the only place the research can be completed.  Still, the government could fund other kinds of research around similar questions. &lt;/p&gt;
