The women were a mean of 82.5 years old at the start of the study, and they used a wrist device that tracked their sleep and circadian rhythm patterns over three consecutive days once at the start of the study and again five years later. Patients filled out sleep logs and were given neuropsychological tests during the five-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QBTFE5LLTBHQ5C74TB4WB5I64A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On average, participants’ total sleep time increased by 18.7 minutes during the five-year follow-up period, and sleep efficiency — a score of sleep quality — increased by 0.94 percent on average. Napping rose over the study period, too, with participants’ napping duration increasing 33.1 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GDYZ36RAQVGBBM76CGDSQOYZTU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;About 44 percent of the women showed stable sleep patterns during the study. Another 34.9 percent were categorized as having declining nighttime sleep, with decreased nighttime sleep quality and slight increases in daytime napping. The final group, which made up 21.3 percent of the women, saw “large increases in daytime and nighttime sleep duration and quality,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U735HJJSSBHLPL3DYX5TPILDWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Overall, 93 of the women — 12.7 percent — developed dementia during the study period. Those in the groups with declining nighttime sleep or large increases in sleep duration and quality were at a 2-to-3-fold higher risk of developing dementia than the women who had stable sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HKAWOL6GTBC3LLCPW6OM2QPSSM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When the researchers adjusted for demographics such as age, education, race and some health conditions, they found that those in the increased sleepiness group had double the dementia risk compared with stable sleepers.

Among the best foods for fiber are raspberries, lentils and avocado, said Saphier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, she said she promotes gut motility (the coordinated muscular contractions that move food and waste through the gastrointestinal tract) with ginger, plus staying hydrated &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/fitness-and-wellbeing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:and exercising;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;and exercising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You do all of that and your gut is going to be as healthy as can be," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about the impact of stress on hair loss and gut health?

They are, however, one of a few reasons you might consider &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/do-you-need-to-wash-rice-before-cooking-heres-the-science-71588" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;washing your grains&lt;/a&gt; in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are rice weevils?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice weevils are a natural part of the environment, and just like us, they love snacking. They do indeed, as their name suggests, love rice, but they are also known to feast on crops of things like corn and other grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/fossilized-insects-photonic-diamonds-reveal-the-evolution-of-structural-color-55717" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;weevils&lt;/a&gt; they have a delightfully noodly snoot that they use to gnaw into the hard casing of rice grains. Not only do they feed on the good stuff inside, but females will also lay their eggs inside rice grains. This is how a rice weevil’s journey to your pantry begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fr-image-container no-background" data-asset-id="82965" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="fr-figcaption"&gt;&lt;p class="fr-caption"&gt;What in the prison break do these rice weevil larva think they're playing at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fr-reference"&gt;Image credit: Tomasz Klejdysz / Shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do weevils get into rice?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrial rice production involves a certain amount of fumigating to try and keep the stock clear of pests, but it’s rarely 100 percent effective. The adult weevils are tiny, but the larvae are even harder to catch because they travel as stowaways tucked safely inside the rice grain. According to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fjzjphH6CM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Deep Look&lt;/a&gt;, scientists have even tried using sound to track down infestations in rice stores by listening out for their chewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They feed on the inside of the rice grain until it’s just an empty shell and then crawl out as adult weevils. Once out, they can start the process of laying their own eggs and this is how even just a couple of weevils can result in an infestation if rice isn’t stored properly and goes uneaten for several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span contenteditable="false" draggable="true" class="fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4fjzjphH6CM??si=CCyBvOPZMranhIP8&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" class="fr-draggable"&gt;VIDEO&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Preventing rice weevils&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice weevils are more common the closer you are to the source, as a &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5923/j.ijaf.20140401.03" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that raw milled rice contained the highest number of weevils. This number dropped off in more treated rice samples, such as that being imported and parboiled rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pre-storage treatment of rice contributes to the likelihood of a rice weevil infestation as well as the actual rice grains themselves, and the researchers suggest that heat sterilization can be effective in minimizing rice weevils. That said, that some weevils make it past fumigation and importation to the bags in some people’s pantries isn’t the end of the world, because eating a couple of weevils won’t hurt you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fr-image-container no-background" data-asset-id="82966" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="fr-figcaption"&gt;&lt;p class="fr-caption"&gt;Rice weevils won't hurt you, but if you leave your rice sitting around for months, they could destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fr-reference"&gt;Image credit: Aurius / Shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are rice weevils harmful?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice weevils aren't always going to be in rice, and even if they were, eating a few won’t harm you. If anything, it’s just going to boost the protein content of your grains a bit, but you can sweep away rice weevils by &lt;a href="https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-safety-tips/food-risk-concerns/risk-at-a-glance/rice-weevils#:~:text=Consumers%20can%20remove%20rice%20weevils,to%20consume%20the%20rice%20thereafter." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;washing your rice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where rice weevils can be harmful is in their hunger for dried goods, and if left to their own devices they’ll reduce your grains to a heap of creepy dust. This is why managing rice weevils is a bit matter of concern for large-scale producers who don’t want to lose their stock, but you the consumer with your modest bag of rice at home don’t need to worry. If you’d like to be extra careful, you can make sure to store your rice properly in an air-tight container somewhere cool and dry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might not want to be accidentally &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkKHRp9YO0o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;eating insects&lt;/a&gt;, but there is something to be said for making these terrestrial arthropods part of the menu.

                As measles cases continue to rise, some parents are asking if their kids can get vaccinated early.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;As a measles outbreak in West Texas and New Mexico continues to grow, and other states report outbreaks of their own, some pediatricians across the U.S. say they are seeing a new trend among concerned parents: vaccine enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Our call center was inundated with calls about the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine," says &lt;a href="https://pbpediatrics.com/staff/shannon-fox-levine/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Shannon Fox-Levine&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician in Broward County, Fla. She says parents are asking if their child is up to date on their vaccinations. Or "should they get another vaccine? Should they get an extra one? Can they get it early?"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Measles &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/1239156786/measles-is-spreading-are-you-safe" target="_blank"&gt;spreads quickly in communities&lt;/a&gt; where vaccination rates are low, and vaccine hesitancy has been on the rise across the U.S. in recent years. Kindergarten &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination rates &lt;/a&gt;have not bounced back to their pre-pandemic levels.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Fox-Levine says the recent interest in the MMR vaccine — which protects against measles, mumps and rubella — is a refreshing change in a state where vaccine hesitancy has been growing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Florida's kindergarten vaccination rates to protect against measles&lt;a href="https://www.wusf.org/health-news-florida/2025-01-13/fewer-florida-kids-getting-routine-vaccinations" target="_blank"&gt; fell to 88.1% in the 2023-2024 school year&lt;/a&gt; — below the 95% vaccination rate considered necessary to protect against outbreaks. So, seeing a demand for vaccines is "exciting," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Five U.S. states are currently experiencing measles outbreaks — New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas, which has the most cases by far, with &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;400 confirmed cases as of Friday&lt;/a&gt;. So far this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. has reported more than 480 measles &lt;/a&gt;cases in 20 states. That's more cases than in all of 2024. Almost all of the cases are in people who were not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Parents are watching what's happening with these outbreaks and concern about potential exposure is growing.  Before the measles vaccine was developed in the early 1960s, the disease &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5292478/measles-vaccination-kids-health-disease" target="_blank"&gt;used to kill hundreds of people &lt;/a&gt;in the U.S. every year.  &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In Southern Pines, N.C., pediatrician &lt;a href="https://sandhillspeds.com/staff/christoph-diasio-md/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Christoph Diasio&lt;/a&gt; says he's had many conversations in recent weeks with families who are interested in getting their children vaccinated against measles earlier than what's usually recommended.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first dose of the MMR vaccine is usually given between 12 and 15 months of age, with a second dose administered between the ages of 4 and 6 years. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/index.html#:~:text=CDC%20recommends%20children%20get%20two,date%20on%20their%20MMR%20vaccination." target="_blank"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; says infants as young as 6 months old can receive the MMR vaccine if they are traveling abroad or are in an outbreak area.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Diasio says families with children younger than 12 months are requesting the shot early, especially if they have travel plans for spring break.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Several families have asked what our game plan is if we get measles in our community," Diasio says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In some cases, Diasio says, his patient families have delayed travel plans until their children are old enough to receive the MMR shot.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The main thing I'm hearing from my patients is not, 'Oh, my gosh, I'm so scared of that measles vaccine. It's more like, can I have one? Should I get an extra?" Diasio says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says one mother he spoke with recently was worried about the potential that unvaccinated relatives could contract measles while flying cross-country to visit her. "It's awful that this is now a discussion we have to have," Diasio says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Interest in vaccinations has ramped up ahead of the spring break travel season, says &lt;a href="https://pediatricpartners.pediatrust.com/Our-Team/Susan-Sirota,-MD" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Susan Sirota&lt;/a&gt;, a primary care pediatrician in the Chicago area.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have many patients calling us because they are traveling to either Texas or places near Texas, or states where they suspect that vaccination rates are lower than we have in Illinois," Sirota says. "Many families are requesting early MMR [vaccines]."&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the measles outbreaks are driving interest in vaccinations, Sirota says they're not the only factor at play. She says many families she works with follow the news, and they worry that vaccines may become less accessible in the future now that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5281452/trump-cabinet-picks-rfk-confirmation-hearing-help-committee" target="_blank"&gt; a longtime critic of vaccines,&lt;/a&gt; is the head of the Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"What I'm seeing is that there's a bit of fear among moms and dads and parents about their ability to protect their children and to prevent diseases because vaccine access is in question for them," Sirota says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And it's not just the measles vaccine. Sirota says some patients are worried about access to the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5323229/hpv-vaccine-cancer-rfk" target="_blank"&gt;HPV vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; which protects against human papillomavirus.  HPV is best known for causing cervical cancer, but can also cause other malignancies, including cancer of the throat and anus. Kennedy has been involved in legal challenges to that vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;During his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he wouldn't take vaccines away from anyone. He has called vaccines a personal choice. NPR reached out to HHS for comment about their plans to maintain people's access to vaccines. They did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's too soon to tell whether anecdotal reports of vaccine enthusiasm will help counter longer-term trends toward growing vaccine hesitancy. According to one &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38806351/" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt;, 1 in 5 U.S. parents are now hesitant about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And studying changes in these attitudes may be harder in the future: The National Institutes of Health has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5325863/nih-trump-vaccine-hesitancy-mrna-research" target="_blank"&gt;terminated millions of dollars worth of grants&lt;/a&gt; for research to study vaccine hesitancy and how to improve immunization levels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited by Jane Greenhalgh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            “Kids! Are one of you taking my lorazepams?” Victoria Ratliff (played by &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/13/entertainment/parker-posey-white-lotus/index.html"&gt;Parker Posey&lt;/a&gt;) asks her children in a scene from this season’s “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/24/entertainment/white-lotus-season-3-episode-6-recap/index.html"&gt;The White Lotus&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I just had my prescription filled, and I can tell some are missing,” she says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            By this point in the series, the viewer knows that it’s not her children Victoria needs to worry about, it’s her husband, Timothy (Jason Isaacs).
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Just one episode earlier, Victoria tells Timothy that he looks tired and should take a nap (as we know, it’s actually crippling anxiety due to events unfolding at home). She offers him a pill from her prescription bottle.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000c356ms6zap0w0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re not addictive. I just take them when I need it,” she says. “You make fun of me, but they work. Not a big deal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            But &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682053.html" target="_blank"&gt;lorazepam&lt;/a&gt; is actually a big deal; it’s a powerful &lt;a href="https://www.dea.gov/factsheets/benzodiazepines" target="_blank"&gt;benzodiazepine&lt;/a&gt; used to treat anxiety disorders. And although it can be a very effective medication, it should be taken only as prescribed by a doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            What else do you need to know about this scene-stealing drug? I asked &lt;a href="https://drgailsaltz.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Gail Saltz&lt;/a&gt;, who serves as a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at &lt;a href="https://www.nyp.org/locations/newyork-presbyterian-weill-cornell-medical-center" target="_blank"&gt;New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, to share her expertise.

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to being a big fan of the show, you’re a doctor who prescribes this very medication. What did you think when you first saw it enter the storyline?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000h356mdg5fhoq2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Gail Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; I thought, “Wow, people get their information about psychiatric care – and all medical care – from watching shows like this, and I really hope they get it right.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000i356mq44sggnf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Who is lorazepam right for, and how does it work?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000j356mjj2koqf4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; Lorazepam is in the class of medications called benzodiazepines, which is a depressant, and also sometimes referred to as a sedative hypnotic medication. It works by increasing a neurotransmitter in your brain called GABA, and that is what makes it somewhat sedating, which is a primary focus of the drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000k356mhuv85ac4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is often used to treat short-term high anxiety or panic – panic attacks, specifically – and even sometimes short-term sleep difficulty.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000l356mnkvbzawa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Benzodiazepines across the board are highly addictive, both physiologically and psychologically, meaning that one, over time, develops a tolerance to this drug. And so the effects that you do initially get – “I have less anxiety” – will, with the same dose, wane, and you will require more of that medication to have the same effect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000m356mw8utnlq8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; What sorts of things do people with a lorazepam prescription need to keep in mind when they’re taking this drug?&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; They need to know the physical effects of this drug, which matter in terms of their safety:
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/list/instances/cm8q8ybe50020356mkun1h6k6@published" class="list " data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.4.text" class="list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        
            They need to be aware that if taken in large doses – essentially an overdose – you can have what’s called &lt;strong&gt;respiratory depression&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning you stop breathing.
        
      &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            That’s why this drug can be dangerous if you take too much or – and this is very important – take it with other medications that cause central nervous system sedation, such as alcohol, opiates, barbiturates, sleeping pills and even some old-style antihistamines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000p356mo06mpg42@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; What is the potential for abuse with lorazepam? What are the risks?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000q356mxs1t0ixj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re taking this for anxiety, for example, as we see in the show – and I would say that Victoria appears to be taking it for social anxiety, when she’s going to go have to be with other people – which is different than Timothy, who is just flooded and in a state of utter traumatic panic and is just popping them indiscriminately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000r356mvvmtaa54@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When you have a positive response, that is what makes a drug psychologically addictive, which is not physiologically addictive. It’s not dangerous, but what it does do is make you want to take more, right? Because anxiety feels bad – really bad – and when you can take a medication that makes you relax and not experience the anxiety, it’s positively reinforcing. Of course you’d want to take that medication again. It made you feel better.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000s356mua8k512t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Is there anyone who would not be a good candidate for a lorazepam prescription?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000t356mkjzvxj7y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, people who need one of these cross-reactive medications that you’re genuinely concerned about the sedative effects. Somebody who is abusing alcohol. Somebody who is abusing other drugs or has really struggled with sobriety, with serious addiction. We try to find ways around prescribing other addictive medication, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000u356mud7l3g05@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Victoria is keenly aware of how many pills she has – or is supposed to have. Is this a more complicated prescription to get or fill than, say, antibiotics?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000v356m5xabzqum@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz: &lt;/strong&gt;Absolutely. It’s considered a controlled substance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000w356m4ox3gzpj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Generally, physicians can prescribe lorazepam, but it is a different level of prescription where the doctor can’t just call it in on the phone. They are going to look at how many they’re prescribing you, as well as if – and how many – refills they would offer you.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000x356msibrvoyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kind of like we do with opioids, if a patient is blowing through them faster than anticipated via the prescription, there needs to be discussion with the patient of, “Why? Where did that go? What is happening? Do you legitimately need more? OK, maybe this is an underdosing. Let’s discuss that. What symptoms are you having? Or are you heading toward tolerance?” And we have to think about what to do here.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000y356msulynyxq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; During another scene in the show, we see Timothy taking these pills while drinking heavily. That can lead to very serious interactions, right?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000z356mw7jpb29x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, yes. Alcohol specifically interacts with benzodiazepines. They both affect the GABA system. They both can cause, on their own, respiratory depression and death – meaning you stop breathing and die. But together, they are what’s called synergistic, meaning it makes each of them have more of that effect than the two of them on their own. So it’s dangerous. That’s why they tell you not to drink when you’re taking lorazepam.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0010356m5rh9fza7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So yeah, he’s pounding them. And you know, it would not be a plot twist that Timothy doesn’t wake up in the morning.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0011356mhv2b5xf8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By the way, you see Victoria – after her lorazepam disappears, because Timothy has swiped it altogether – now drinking a lot more. And that is probably because, in addition to being stressed about [spoiler redacted], she doesn’t have the medication to cover her, so she’s drinking.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0012356m5ap8w9g8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; In the same episode, Timothy steals a security guard’s gun that he forgot to lock up – and later we see him seriously contemplate suicide. While we aren’t inside (show creator, writer and director) &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/entertainment/mike-white-career-white-lotus/index.html"&gt;Mike White&lt;/a&gt;’s head, is suicidal ideation a known potential side effect of this drug, or do you think this is more likely the result of everything else Timothy is going through?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0013356mh0qh2hje@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; Lorazepam by itself does not cause suicidal ideation, but it is disinhibiting – meaning thoughts that might come into your mind, that you might go, “Oh, no, no, no. I don’t want that thought. Can’t have that thought,” and I push it away. Your ability to suppress it is really not there. So whatever thoughts you’re having would be disinhibited.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0014356mmcpvxhv5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Timothy’s situation, all by itself, would cause depression. Depression drives suicidal ideation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0015356mwdsjesvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another feature of lorazepam that is adding to that is basically poor cognitive functioning. Lorazepam literally slows your thoughts. It’s called thought deceleration. And in slowing your thoughts, your ability to problem-solve – which he clearly needs right now – is impaired. And so he is probably feeling like he cannot think his way out of anything right now, and this is a very dire situation.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0016356mhbaptcor@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Now that Timothy has stolen Victoria’s entire prescription bottle, is she going to experience any withdrawal symptoms? What does that look like?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0017356me1e1cipi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; The question will be, how frequently was Victoria taking this lorazepam? Was this a prescription that was basically like, “Here are 30 lorazepam for the month”?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0018356mqhschidh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If she knows, “I’m going to dinner and I have to be at a resort and socialize with other people, and this makes me feel panicky, I can take a lorazepam for the dinner, and I’ll be OK,” but she’s not taking it during the day or any other time, she’s probably not addicted. She’s probably OK from a physiologic standpoint.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0019356m9jzd7jo8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If someone who is taking lorazepam more regularly abruptly stops this medication after they are tolerant to it or addicted – which can be a matter of just a couple weeks – you can have a spike in blood pressure. You can have a whole host of very miserable flu-like feelings, confusion, and actually, these things can rise to the level of causing death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz001a356mvx5dev6h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s a very serious medication to be aware of its easy abuse potential, even in a person who has no intention of abusing it. We have yet to see in the plot whether that will come to pass, but it is something I as a psychiatrist have been concerned about as I watch.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz001b356mzrmf0adu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Some people, in consultation with their doctor, will absolutely benefit from a lorazepam prescription. But not everyone with anxiety needs this medication. What are some other tried-and-true ways to manage anxiety?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz001c356mkfzc7snd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; If you struggle with anxiety, there are a lot of coping tools that you can build into your day that will help you manage it and not get to the level of an anxiety disorder. Those run the gamut from things like a regular practice of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/07/health/breathing-stress-relief-calm-wellness/index.html"&gt;paced deep breathing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/11/health/progressive-muscle-relaxation-mindfulness-wellness/index.html"&gt;progressive muscle relaxation&lt;/a&gt;, 30 minutes of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/15/health/exercise-stress-heart-disease-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;aerobic exercise&lt;/a&gt; a day with your heart rate up, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness/index.html"&gt;talking to somebody&lt;/a&gt; about whatever you’re anxious about. That could be someone supportive in your world. That could be a therapist. I always say that should be your first stop.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz001d356mv0yocu18@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; A main character dies at the end of every season of “The White Lotus.” Do you want to go on the record with who you think is going to die this season? Just two episodes left!
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz001e356mk1tzwmlj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t know why I’m even saying this exactly. It’s just some general gestalt feeling. But I feel this sad feeling like, what’s the name of Rick’s girlfriend again? Chelsea! She’s the one character that maybe I can feel some compassion for on the show.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz001f356mqdui3qng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chelsea is sort of a lost soul, decent person – seemingly, so far, right? Bad things keep happening to Chelsea, and she’s heralding that this really has meaning to her. She’s anticipating bad things. And so, I don’t know if they’re foreshadowing her in that way, but for me, it’s resonating as, you know – they never take out the truly horrendous people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

A test ordered by a veterinarian came back positive for bird flu. Within days, Kira’s condition had deteriorated — she became lethargic and had trouble breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After several trips to the vet and emergency room in Portland, Oregon, where Hanson lives, he made the painful decision to put Kira down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“She was the happiest cat I’ve ever had,” he said. “You’d walk past her and she’d do a little back flip and get on her back so you could rub her belly. She did that in the hospital the last night… She just very lethargically flopped on her back so we could rub her belly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The manufacturer of the pet food, Wild Coast Pet Foods, subsequently &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/voluntary-recall-wild-coast-raw-boneless-free-range-chicken-formula-raw-pet-food-because-possible" target="_blank"&gt;recalled lots of the formula&lt;/a&gt; Kira had consumed due to potential bird flu contamination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hanson filed a lawsuit against the company earlier this month, alleging that it had failed to disclose the risk of bird flu in its raw pet food. He is seeking roughly $8,000 to cover the cost of Kira’s veterinary bills. Wild Coast did not respond to a request for comment. In &lt;a href="https://wildcoastpets.com/wild-coast-safety-steps-for-h5n1/" target="_blank"&gt;a letter to customers&lt;/a&gt;, the company said it had “transitioned to fully cooked poultry recipes to eliminate any potential risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-kira-hospital-ew-502p-c7d9a1.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-kira-hospital-ew-502p-c7d9a1.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-kira-hospital-ew-502p-c7d9a1.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-kira-hospital-ew-502p-c7d9a1.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-kira-hospital-ew-502p-c7d9a1.jpg" alt="Tim Hanson’s cat Kira in the hospital."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Tim Hanson’s cat Kira in the hospital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Tim Hanson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to the U.S. Agriculture Department, 126 domestic cats in the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals" target="_blank"&gt;have been infected with bird flu&lt;/a&gt; since 2022. Around half of those cases were recorded this year, and many were exposed through food or milk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We see continued reports of cats with bird flu infection from across the country, and it’s kept increasing in the past months,” said Suresh Kuchipudi, professor of infectious diseases and microbiology at University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In cats, bird flu tends to be swift and lethal. Although the overall risk to indoor cats is low, Kuchipudi and other experts who study or diagnose the infections say the threat is mounting. With bird flu spreading rampantly among poultry and cattle, there is a constant opportunity for the virus to enter the raw food supply. And while there’s no evidence yet that cats can transmit bird flu to people, the potential increases as more cats get sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We don’t have the evidence, but it doesn’t mean that it may not have happened, or it can’t happen,” Kuchipudi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;At least 3 pet food recalls in 4 months&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most pet food is heated to a high enough temperature to kill pathogens before it’s packaged, but bird flu can linger in raw food if it’s sourced from infected poultry — for instance, from chickens that were culled due to an outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The animals that were depopulated could potentially have ended up in the food chain for pets,” said Laura Goodman, an assistant professor at Cornell University’s Baker Institute for Animal Health. “It’s not uncommon for substandard meat to end up in the pet food chain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In the last four months, at least three pet food manufacturers have recalled batches containing raw poultry. The Food and Drug Administration in January &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/cvm-updates/cat-and-dog-food-manufacturers-required-consider-h5n1-food-safety-plans" target="_blank"&gt;warned manufacturers using uncooked meat&lt;/a&gt; to reassess their food safety plans in light of the recent cat illnesses and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Other cats have been exposed to bird flu on dairy farms, likely from drinking raw milk from infected cows. And in some instances, outdoor cats have picked up the virus directly from dead birds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7405a2.htm#contribAff" target="_blank"&gt;report in February&lt;/a&gt; also described two indoor cats that lived with dairy farm workers and contracted bird flu. The research suggests that “individuals who are working on dairies or hauling milk have the potential to carry virus into their house on their clothing or on their shoes, and in turn the cats then are exposed,” said Kimberly Dodd, dean of the Michigan State University College of Veterinary Medicine, who coauthored the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There is no active surveillance for bird flu in healthy cats, so cases could be underreported. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11528901/#sec26" target="_blank"&gt;study of stray cats&lt;/a&gt; in the Netherlands found that nearly 12% were positive for bird flu antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We may be only testing the sickest cats or one cat from a household. It’s very likely that there have been many cases out there that the cat was not brought to a veterinarian or testing wasn’t done,” said Kristy Pabilonia, director of veterinary diagnostic laboratories at Colorado State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Pabilonia oversaw the diagnostic testing for a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/hairless_leo/" target="_blank"&gt;hairless cat named Leonardo DiCaprio&lt;/a&gt;, who was found to have bird flu in January. Leo’s owner, Steve Werfelmann, said his cat had eaten chicken-based raw pet food from the company Savage Pet, which &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/savage-pet-recalls-savage-cat-food-chicken-large-and-small-boxes-because-possible-bird-flu-health?fbclid=IwY2xjawJJx4hleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHUGDboc0G0uQ72RfJYtFDWs67vQGhADUsWqPNkQWjIBCbssoHvywlAjrdA_aem_pwkkhTKW7ScKMDWox9C35A" target="_blank"&gt;recalled dozens of batches&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Leo-Steve-Werfelmann-ew-503p-14c0eb.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Leo-Steve-Werfelmann-ew-503p-14c0eb.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Leo-Steve-Werfelmann-ew-503p-14c0eb.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Leo-Steve-Werfelmann-ew-503p-14c0eb.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Leo-Steve-Werfelmann-ew-503p-14c0eb.jpg" alt="Steve Werfelmann's cat Leo."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Steve Werfelmann's cat Leo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Steve Werfelmann&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“When we adopted him, that was the recommended food” for his skin, Werfelmann said. “But then talking to the vet and going through this process, they actually told us there’s no real scientific evidence to back up raw food being better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Savage Pet referred NBC News to &lt;a href="https://savagecatfood.com/avian-influenza/" target="_blank"&gt;an online statement&lt;/a&gt;, which says “all of our poultry ingredients are USDA inspected and passed for human consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The current bird flu strain, which began spreading among wild birds and poultry in the U.S. in 2022, often causes severe neurological symptoms in cats, such as seizures and blindness, as well as difficulty breathing and discharge from the eyes and nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Cats may be seen circling or having a head tilt or just acting very abnormally. Some of those clinical signs are very similar to what we see in rabies,” Dodd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Leo didn’t show neurological symptoms, aside from wobbliness in his back legs, Werfelmann said. Instead, his main symptoms were fever, lethargy and not eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We thought he was going to die,” Werfelmann said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Colorado Department of Agriculture announced this month that &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/coloradoag/photos/colorado-has-detected-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-hpai-h5n1-in-11-domestic/1180459680757615/" target="_blank"&gt;11 domestic cats there&lt;/a&gt; had gotten bird flu from raw poultry or pet food. Leo was the only one to survive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;‘It’s the milk’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Scientists are still trying to understand what makes bird flu so deadly in cats. The virus is highly fatal to birds but seems to affect cats more severely than some other mammals. Far fewer cases have been recorded in dogs, and though &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/mammals.html" target="_blank"&gt;nearly 1,000 dairy herds have been affected&lt;/a&gt;, the disease tends to be milder in cows. In people, only one of the 70 cases recorded in the U.S. has been fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kuchipudi’s &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2024.2440498#abstract" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has identified receptors throughout cats’ bodies that allow them to be infected by a broad range of flu viruses, including H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“When you examine these animals, the virus is everywhere in the body,” he said. “It causes a systemic infection that is potentially very severe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Joseph Journell lost two of his cats, Alexander and Tuxedo, to bird flu just days apart in November. He had been giving them raw milk, believing it to contain extra nutrients. A third cat, Big Boy, also got sick after drinking the milk and wound up in critical condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Big-Boy-Cleopatra-Joseph-Journell-ew-504p-dd3c35.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Big-Boy-Cleopatra-Joseph-Journell-ew-504p-dd3c35.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Big-Boy-Cleopatra-Joseph-Journell-ew-504p-dd3c35.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Big-Boy-Cleopatra-Joseph-Journell-ew-504p-dd3c35.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Big-Boy-Cleopatra-Joseph-Journell-ew-504p-dd3c35.jpg" alt="Joseph Journell's cats, including Big Boy, left."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Joseph Journell's cats, including Big Boy, left.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Joseph Journell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I said, ‘Whatever’s wrong with Big Boy is the same thing wrong with Tuxsie and then obviously the same thing wrong with Alexander,’” said Journell, who lives in San Bernardino, California. “It’s the milk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Big Boy tested positive for bird flu via a urine sample in December. He has since recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The milk the three cats consumed came from a California dairy farm called Raw Farm LLC, according to Journell’s lawyer. The farm &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bird-flu-detected-second-lot-raw-milk-sold-california-health-officials-rcna182152" target="_blank"&gt;issued a recall&lt;/a&gt; after California health officials said samples were positive for bird flu. The farm did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment, but in &lt;a href="https://rawfarmusa.com/blog/recall-was-unfounded-and-is-now-lifted" target="_blank"&gt;an online statement&lt;/a&gt; last month, it said the recall had been “unfounded” and that there was “no evidence of adulterated product connecting to any consumer illness.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-cats-drink-raw-milk-ac-723p-f16ab0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-cats-drink-raw-milk-ac-723p-f16ab0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-cats-drink-raw-milk-ac-723p-f16ab0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-cats-drink-raw-milk-ac-723p-f16ab0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-cats-drink-raw-milk-ac-723p-f16ab0.jpg" alt="cat cats feline raw milk"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Big Boy and Alexander drink raw milk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Joseph Journell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Like Hanson in Oregon, Journell decided to pursue legal action. His lawyer sent a letter in January to the owner of Raw Farm, indicating Journell’s intent to recoup more than $16,000 in veterinary expenses, lost wages and caretaker fees for Big Boy. They hope to mediate the situation with the company outside of court but plan to file suit if that’s not possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;A threat to humans?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When the veterinary office learned about Kira’s raw food diet, Hanson said, they suspected bird flu right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They immediately put on their PPE,” Hanson said. “I was taken aback.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Although there’s some evidence that cats can pass bird flu to each other, there’s no evidence so far that they have transmitted the virus to people. However, the more the virus spreads in cats, the more opportunities it has to mutate and get better at spreading to humans. Outdoor cats, in particular, could serve as a transmission “bridge” between wild animals and domestic pets or humans, Kuchipudi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vet-catches-bird-flu-cat-new-york-n699316" target="_blank"&gt;a veterinarian at a New York City animal shelter&lt;/a&gt; tested positive for a different strain of bird flu, H7N2, after contact with sick cats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We need to be aware of these ongoing circulations that could potentially complicate the disease transmission and also [pose] a risk to human health,” Kuchipudi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hanson said he was tested for bird flu after Kira died and was negative. In his cat’s final days, he said, he wore an N95 mask around her and washed his clothes upon returning home from the animal hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He hopes his story will serve as a warning to other cat owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I don’t want any more cats dying,” he said. “Hopefully people can learn from Kira’s passing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE96cER2UzAxN1JuaVhkWGRoV0NMUTJyNmxNLXFhckZ0eWpIRk5SbC1UOV9OLVBwdmhVekxFWkcxVTFVZGpkQXFlV05KbzR3czRXRXdORGJjQV84TkY5R1RCX1YyRDBrcUZsek1nandHcVJZM1hWMFHSAVZBVV95cUxOTDNlU05mM2RsaHl2aWZEdUlIeTFfR2F1dXo2eDJPNXREZDhIYlZUNHlsMDVQRHl2UEZyaWk4VXhBNWNwX1ZuSTFjb2g1U09Pc3BJNlBJUQ</guid></item><item><title>Tuberculosis is the world’s top infectious killer.

            When health workers stopped visiting her home in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/12/asia/pakistan-balochistan-train-hostage-wednesday-intl-hnk/index.html"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; to administer &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/health/tuberculosis-outbreak-kansas/index.html"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; medication, Ratna Jamni began dragging herself to a clinic “step by painful step, when even standing feels impossible.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The 40-year-old had been receiving treatment and mental health support for months at home after contracting drug-resistant TB, but those visits have all stopped.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Every trip is painful, exhausting and humiliating. I don’t know how much longer I can do this,” she told CNN via the Dopasi Foundation, a Pakistan-based NGO whose &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/politics/trump-admin-terminates-syria-white-helmets-funding/index.html"&gt;USAID&lt;/a&gt;-funded programs helped provide her health care.

            “The journey is long, my body is weak, and every breath feels heavier than the last. I wonder if it’s even worth it. I wish this suffering would end – either the help returns or I no longer have to endure this pain.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Tuberculosis, a bacterial infection usually found in the lungs, remains the world’s top infectious killer,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;causing 1.25 million deaths worldwide in 2023, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slhyxb0007356me837im0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With the right health care and drugs, TB is treatable and preventable. Without treatment, it has a death rate of close to 50%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slicgy000c356md6gyznzn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Like that of millions of other TB patients across the world, Jamni’s treatment was supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). It has now been interrupted by the Trump administration’s sudden freezing, and subsequent cutting, of vast swathes of the agency’s funding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sljcl7000h356mloa01qnr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aid groups and doctors warn that these cuts are likely to cause thousands of unnecessary deaths and a rise in TB infections worldwide, including in the US itself; and create the conditions for an extremely drug-resistant form of the disease to spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sljaf6000f356mpc6g44ye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Already, more than 11,000 additional TB patients are estimated to have died in the two months since almost all USAID funding froze on January 24, according to a model built by UN-affiliated organization Stop TB Partnership.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slji1e000k356m6e50bv88@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            TB infections are also expected to increase by 28-32% globally this year as a result of the cuts, according to a memo issued by a top USAID official, Nicholas Enrich, who was placed on administrative leave. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sljxkf000p356m7dad3rtp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The State Department, which now handles queries for USAID, told CNN that certain TB programs are “active today in more than a dozen countries,” in line “with Secretary (of State Marco) Rubio’s exemption for life-saving humanitarian assistance.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sljxkf000q356mp6d5wu2g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These programs are helping to find and cure hundreds of thousands of cases of tuberculosis by providing access to low-cost, life-saving testing and medicine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sljv94000n356m8iu2qiky@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            US funding was an integral part of the global TB response, distributing grants both directly to 24&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;national governments whose countries have high rates of the disease and via international or local non-governmental organizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slkd6g000v356mo3m0kol5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            USAID was deeply enmeshed in global HIV/AIDS health care too, and TB is the leading cause of death for people with HIV, according to WHO.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slkp1t000y356mcsnj42zn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unlike previous changes in funding flows, which came with prior warning, this freeze is unprecedented in both its scale and abruptness, meaning that it’s “very difficult for these countries overnight to find the resources” to plug the gap, Dr. Lucica Ditiu, CEO of the UN-affiliated Stop TB Partnership, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sll9gr0013356m6s2byd5l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And while local aid groups call for a shift to domestic funding, the situation right now is deteriorating.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sll9gr0014356m49tdoyq5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the 27 countries worst affected by the cuts, that funding gap is leading to “crippling breakdowns in their TB response with devastating consequences,” WHO said in a statement on March 20.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sll1ry0011356mmz1xm2nj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The precise nature of the impact has varied worldwide, depending on the role USAID played in the network of funding streams contributing to each country’s TB program.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slln0i0019356miff8tjhv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In almost half of Mozambique, for example, no one can currently be diagnosed with TB, since US funding supported its lab networks and system that transported samples of spit and mucus, Ditiu said. Some programs, like Stop TB Partnership’s Global Drug Facility, which facilitates global access to relatively cheap drugs, have had some funding restored by temporary waivers, Ditiu said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sllky80017356mjuscco4y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But more have not, and nine countries are struggling to procure TB drugs, threatening patients’ access to them, WHO said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slluu8001c356m2kqxndvx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health workers based in Cambodia, Pakistan, Nigeria, South Africa and Eswatini told CNN the biggest cuts to their programs were mostly in active case-finding, which allows for earlier diagnosis to stem the spread of disease, and in community outreach.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slm9cq001h356mlnxnu2io@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One such USAID-funded program in Cambodia, run by local HIV and TB organization KHANA, had screened more than 780,000 people for TB in remote areas, traced more than 16,000 close contacts of TB patients and supported more than 800 patients with multi-drug-resistant TB during the past five years, according to its executive director, Choub Sok Chamreun.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slm43r001f356mwjdmteuo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All that work has now stopped. As a result, the number of new TB cases reported in the region has dropped from about 650-850 per month to just 250 in February, meaning that hundreds are going undiagnosed and without care, Chamreun told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slmfz9001k356mga3nnwly@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This means that people don’t come to services. It means that the infection continues to spread over the community … it means that the aim to end TB by 2030 is impossible,” he said, referencing the UN’s goal to largely eliminate the disease by the end of the decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sln919001n356m95inns92@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Similarly, another case-finding program supported by USAID in 27 of Pakistan’s districts has ceased, along with the means of transporting sputum samples, and community monitoring that aims to identify any barriers to TB treatment, Kinz ul Eman, CEO of the Dopasi Foundation, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slnqgw001s356mcm4yvid1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sudden cuts also mean immediately laying off field health workers who “actually risked their life to support your project activity, to support their community,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slnqgw001t356makt7r4oi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            TB disproportionately affects marginalised communities and people living in poverty for whom government health care is less accessible, making such outreach even more important.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slnkoh001q356mz6yyqs1m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One such program, overseen by Dr. Steven John, an official at the Ministry of Health in Adamawa State, Nigeria, was implementing TB health care for nomadic populations there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slo20g001y356mfslcy4dl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With the funding freeze, his program can no longer reach the 60-70% of the community who have yet to access its services, even as people there “approach the organization (saying) ‘When are you coming?’” he told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slnw50001w356mnzamp58i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Suddenly restricting access to drugs and treatment also creates the conditions for a mutated, multi-drug-resistant strain of TB to thrive as patients partway through a four- or six-month treatment regimen may be forced to stop taking them, aid groups and doctors say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sloqc50025356mn8p8gc71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Anytime you cease a treatment in the middle of the course of therapy, you promote the selection of drug resistance and people then become contagious again to others in their community,” explained Dr. Kenneth Castro, a professor at Emory University who previously served as director of the division for tuberculosis elimination at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slojge0023356mbbdz6xi0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Very few drugs can treat such an extreme form of TB. “You create, basically, a bug which is virtually resistant to what we have,” said Ditiu.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slp3l8002a356m3v4gkfrt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That risk is magnified since a lot of USAID’s funding, especially in Africa, focused on supporting people living with multi-drug-resistant TB, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slp3l8002b356mtt3nwla8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And anecdotal reports of patients stopping their courses of medication are already emerging. One patient in Uganda started sharing her medication with her husband, meaning they are both taking half the prescribed amount, Bruce Tushabe, an official at advocacy group the AIDS and Rights Alliance for Southern Africa, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slp3l8002c356mbj9urm7w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another person who used to get medication from a specialist, now-closed clinic can’t stand in the queues at the general clinics due to the stigma TB patients still face, Tushabe added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slp3l8002d356mojec29i3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As TB rates rise globally, they are likely to increase in the US as well, said Castro, while pointing out that the country still has one of the world’s lowest rates of the disease at 2.9 cases per 100,000 people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sloss80028356mkunqgsrl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nonetheless, warning signs are lighting up – in January, the Kansas City metro area was hit by a wave of TB, causing dozens of illnesses and at least two deaths. And childhood TB cases in Europe rose by 10% in 2023, showing that transmission of the disease is still ongoing, WHO said on Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slp68o002g356mj725kj5j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The irony,” Castro added, “is that these disinvestments end up resulting at higher cost to recover and mitigate the damage done.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

              &lt;/div&gt;

  "&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As Brandes lay bleeding, Meiwes read a &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/michelelbird/funniest-star-trek-jokes"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; novel, periodically checking on him. Hours later, with Brandes drifting in and out of consciousness, Meiwes ended his life by stabbing him in the throat. Over the next 10 months, Meiwes consumed approximately 20 kilograms of Brandes's flesh, storing body parts in his freezer under pizza boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meiwes was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/dec/04/germany.lukeharding" target="_blank"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; in December 2002 after an Austrian student alerted authorities to a new advertisement from Meiwes. Upon searching Meiwes's home, police found body parts and a videotape detailing the entire event. In court, Meiwes said the crime was something he had wanted to do for a long time, adding, "I always had the fantasy and in the end I fulfilled it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was convicted of manslaughter in 2004 and sentenced to eight and a half years, but given life in prison for murder after a 2006 retrial.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers also found that the local environment plays a significant role in shaping how our ears respond to different sound frequencies. The study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-92763-6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that both biological and environmental factors influence human hearing more than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Patricia Balaresque at the Centre for Biodiversity and Environmental Research in Toulouse, France, in collaboration with Professor Turi King from the University of Bath in the United Kingdom. The team set out to explore a question that has been surprisingly underexamined: What shapes the diversity in human hearing beyond aging and noise exposure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most previous studies of hearing have focused on people living in industrialized countries, often assuming that any loss in hearing ability is due mainly to age, loud noise, or harmful chemicals. But those explanations don’t apply to everyone. People who haven’t been exposed to excessive noise or toxins still show different levels of hearing sensitivity. The team wanted to understand whether these differences could also be linked to biology, such as sex and age, or to external factors like language, local ecology, or population history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer this, the researchers studied a wide variety of human populations. They tested 448 healthy adults from 13 distinct groups across five countries: Ecuador, England, Gabon, South Africa, and Uzbekistan. These populations were chosen to represent a broad mix of environments, from dense forests and high-altitude rural areas to urban settings. By looking at such a diverse sample, the researchers hoped to capture how both human biology and the surrounding environment might influence hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure hearing sensitivity, the team used a technique called Transient-Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions. This test doesn’t require the person to respond to sounds, which makes it ideal for comparing hearing across languages and cultures. Instead, a small device plays a clicking sound into the ear and then records the tiny sounds the inner ear sends back in response. These returning signals are created by cells in the cochlea and give a reliable indication of how sensitive the ear is to sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team recorded these signals from both ears of each participant, collecting thousands of individual profiles. They also took detailed notes on each person’s age, sex, and hearing health history, excluding anyone with known hearing problems or recent ear infections. Participants completed questionnaires about their general health and lifestyle, and researchers made sure that no one taking medications that could affect hearing was included in the final analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the data were collected, the researchers examined several features of the signals, including how strong they were (measured in decibels) and which frequencies the ear responded to most strongly. They also compared how these features varied based on a person’s sex, age, which ear was tested, their population, the type of environment they lived in, and their language group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Across all 13 populations, women had more sensitive hearing than men—by about two decibels on average. This pattern held across all tested frequencies, not just at high frequencies where earlier studies had noted differences. The researchers suggest that this may reflect a universal biological trait rather than a culturally specific pattern. They point to possible causes such as hormonal influences during development or subtle structural differences in the cochlea between sexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the effect of age was present but less pronounced. People’s hearing did become less sensitive as they got older, particularly after the age of 35, but this decline was smaller than the difference observed between men and women. The left and right ears also differed slightly, with the right ear being a bit more sensitive on average—a pattern that has been seen before and may relate to how the brain processes sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most unexpected finding was the strong role of the environment. People living in different ecological settings had not only different hearing sensitivity levels but also responded best to different ranges of sound frequencies. For instance, individuals from high-altitude rural areas in the Andes had the lowest hearing sensitivity overall. This may relate to the body’s response to low oxygen or other altitude-related stressors. In contrast, people living in tropical forests had higher sensitivity, especially in frequency ranges important for detecting natural sounds, which may help in environments with dense vegetation and rich animal life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urban environments also appeared to shape hearing in unique ways. People in cities had hearing profiles shifted toward higher frequencies, possibly as a response to the constant low-frequency hum of traffic and other city noise. This adaptation mirrors what has been observed in birds living in cities, which often sing at higher pitches to be heard over the background noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also explored whether language played a role, grouping participants by their language family (such as Indo-European or Niger-Congo). While language had some effect, it was not as strong as the influence of the physical environment, suggesting that ecological factors play a larger role in shaping hearing than cultural or linguistic differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any study, there are some limitations. The researchers did not follow individuals over time, so they couldn’t directly measure how hearing changes in response to environmental shifts. Also, while the study excluded people with known hearing damage, there may still have been unreported exposures to noise or other unknown influences. Genetic data were not analyzed, so it’s unclear whether the observed differences are inherited or are the result of adaptation during a person’s lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors say future research should explore whether the variations they found are due to genetic adaptation to local environments or whether they reflect flexible responses to the conditions people live in—what scientists call phenotypic plasticity. If environmental changes like noise pollution or altitude can reshape hearing, it suggests the human auditory system is more adaptable than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, King noted the broader importance of the findings: “We know that humans are continuing to evolve, so the next question is whether our hearing can change in response to different environments generally or whether there are genetic adaptations involved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Patricia Balaresque added, “Our findings challenge existing assumptions and highlight the need to consider both biological and environmental factors when studying hearing. Identifying drivers behind natural hearing variation will improve our understanding of hearing loss and individual differences in noise tolerance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-92763-6"&gt;Sex and environment shape cochlear sensitivity in human populations worldwide&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Patricia Balaresque, Sébastien Delmotte, Franklin Delehelle, Andreia Moreira, Nancy Saenz-Oyhéréguy, Myriam Croze, Tatyana Hegay, Tamara Aripova, Sylvie Le Bomin, Philippe Mennecier, Didier Descouens, Sylvain Cussat-Blanc, Hervé Luga, Angel Guevara, Maria Eugenia D’Amato, Turi King, Catherine Mollereau, and Evelyne Heyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 18:08:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQbjRfVzBmWWlUY0xCc0ZNb2ZOWDZWUVozTU1PREk2M2JxR1ZUenFMNHliTWJFaHY4Q3otMUxyWE1pMDYxNldDR0tMQ0hqaTdDRlBlRXNkcHJHUHNnakxaM2JaUGpZeWZyQlF3MEctZWdXMVZidEJRTUFjTWNscEdmNlZaeE1SNVJOT0lDZDg0STl5TUt6bnUwdTVidUJVaV83U2ZRS1ZlOHktY21JdUpQa19NOWtXeUE</guid></item><item><title>The Average Weight for American Women - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE44UFkwZ0hOeWpGU3hXTE5HbEJBczFxZUM0eXlxeWw5MzUteUY2Z012STdDMXR6MGhkZEwzZzEzb0FNOHVNTnBZVURVWlppXzY2dHZwLU9mY0ZkMDBzekZhWDlSVF9OdUVYWTBpRWtlV2xuZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;JLco - Julia Amaral/istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Is the Average Weight for Women?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article was reviewed by Craig Primack, MD, FACP, FAAP, FOMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for straight answers, here they are: The average weight for women in the U.S. is 170.8 pounds, and the average height is 5 feet, 3 inches tall.

We learned a lot about the often contradictory beliefs we hold about weight, including what we believe is normal for our own weight and the weight of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey found that women believe the ideal weight for women is 139 pounds. But when asked about their personal ideal weight, the answers changed. When speaking about themselves, the average goal weight for women reported by women in this study was 144 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's up with these discrepancies? According to Dr. Jessica Shepherd, chief medical officer at Hers, there are a few factors at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Body image is a multifaceted construct which includes positive and negative attitudes, thoughts, and behaviors," she says.

Many variables can affect our waistlines, and they can come into play at different points in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these factors include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hormones&lt;/b&gt;. Changes in estrogen and progesterone levels throughout the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause can affect &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5850121/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:metabolism and weight regulation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;metabolism and weight regulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genetics&lt;/b&gt;. Genes can influence body composition, like where we tend to hang onto fat, and even how quickly we burn calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nutrition&lt;/b&gt;. Eating habits, the nutritional quality of our diets, and portion sizes impact weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Physical activity&lt;/b&gt;. Cardio and strength training affect calorie expenditure, muscle mass, and overall body composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stress&lt;/b&gt;. Chronic stress can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/guides/how-to-stop-emotional-eating" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:emotional eating;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;emotional eating&lt;/a&gt;, hormonal imbalances, and changes in appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sleep&lt;/b&gt;. Poor sleep quality can disrupt hormone levels, metabolism, and appetite regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Medical conditions&lt;/b&gt;. Certain health conditions like PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), thyroid disorders, and &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/conditions/insulin-resistance" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin resistance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; can affect weight regulation in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Medications&lt;/b&gt;. Medications like antidepressants, birth control pills, and corticosteroids may cause weight fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Social and cultural factors&lt;/b&gt;. Our eating habits are partly shaped by societal norms, cultural attitudes toward food, and peer or familial influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mental health&lt;/b&gt;. Emotional well-being, self-esteem, and coping mechanisms all play a role in weight maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your age group, height, race, and ethnicity can also impact your weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Prostock-Studio/istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6 Tips for Healthy Weight Management&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy weight management is a lifelong process. Your lifestyle habits are essential to achieving and maintaining a healthy weight and reducing your risk of weight-related health problems like &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/conditions/obesity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; and heart disease. So toss the weight chart in the trash and consider these tips instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a goal to aim for, a healthcare provider can let you know what a healthy weight range would be for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Focus on Nutrients&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrition is one of the most important components of your overall health and wellness. Not only does a nutrient-rich diet provide the vitamins, minerals, fiber, antioxidants, and macronutrients (&lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/how-much-protein-eat-lose-weight" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, fats, and carbs) your body needs to thrive, but it also supports healthy weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few things to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eat mostly whole foods&lt;/b&gt;. These include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, and other lean proteins. This mix provides an array of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, and they’re rich in &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/fiber-for-weight-loss" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which helps you feel full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Minimize ultra-processed foods&lt;/b&gt;. Examples include soda, candy, and packaged snack foods. These tend to be high in saturated fat, sodium, and added sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focus on nutrients versus calories&lt;/b&gt;. Rather than being laser-focused on counting calories, put nutrients first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Ladanifer/Istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Get Better Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not getting enough sleep will wreck anyone’s day, and things can go downhill fast if this is an ongoing problem. Sleep deprivation does more than just make you cranky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of sleep makes us more prone to sugar cravings and mindless eating. Experts say adults should get &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29073412/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:seven to nine hours;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;seven to nine hours&lt;/a&gt; of quality sleep per night. If you don’t normally sleep very well, try these tips to catch more Zzz’s:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow a consistent sleep-wake schedule, meaning you go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopt a calming nighttime routine you can look forward to each evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dress in breathable PJs and use comfy bedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid screens close to bedtime, as the blue light can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9424753/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:interfere with melatonin production;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;interfere with melatonin production&lt;/a&gt; and make it harder to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use black-out curtains or a white noise machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to your healthcare provider if you think you have &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/conditions/sleep-apnea" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep apnea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;JLco - Julia Amaral/istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Move Your Body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is important for supporting your overall health and achieving your weight goals. Regular exercise helps you burn extra calories, lose weight, and put on muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For general health, experts recommend at least &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:150 minutes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;150 minutes&lt;/a&gt; of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise weekly, plus strength training twice per week. For weight loss goals, this increases to 200 to 300 minutes per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/steps-a-day-lose-weight" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:getting your steps in;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;getting your steps in&lt;/a&gt;, here are a few things to try:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swimming&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jogging&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing martial arts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing basketball&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining a group fitness class&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-intensity interval training (HIIT)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using resistance bands, dumbbells, or weight machines, or doing bodyweight exercises&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;KucherAV/ iStockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Consider Weight Loss Medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When daily lifestyle habits alone aren’t enough to promote weight loss, many people find success with &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/weight-loss-medication" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight loss medications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;weight loss medications&lt;/a&gt;. Intended to be used alongside a healthy diet and exercise, some of the most popular and effective weight loss medications include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;GLP-1 receptor agonists&lt;/b&gt;. These work by mimicking the effects of the naturally occurring hormone GLP-1, which regulates appetite and food intake. By activating GLP-1 receptors in your brain, GLP-1s help promote fullness, slow digestion, and decrease cravings. Examples include liraglutide (Saxenda) and &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/weight-loss/compounded-semaglutide" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:semaglutide;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;semaglutide&lt;/a&gt; (Wegovy or Ozempic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Metformin&lt;/b&gt;. Metformin is primarily used to improve blood sugar regulation in those with type 2 diabetes, but it may also support weight loss by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6520185/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:decreasing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;decreasing&lt;/a&gt; appetite and reducing the absorption of glucose from food in the intestines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contrave&lt;/b&gt;. This is a combination of bupropion (an antidepressant and aid to quit smoking) and naltrexone (used for alcohol and opioid dependence). Bupropion helps reduce appetite and cravings, while naltrexone counteracts the effects of certain brain chemicals involved in food reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Topiramate&lt;/b&gt;. Topiramate is often used as an antiepileptic medication, but it can support weight loss by suppressing appetite and promoting feelings of fullness. It may also influence your brain's reward pathways, potentially reducing cravings for high-calorie foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Ridofranz/istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Nurture Social Connections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were never meant to do life alone, and this includes the journey to achieving a healthy weight. Social connections provide support, accountability, and encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37698801/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that people who have these types of networks experience better weight loss outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining a group fitness community or jogging with friends builds a sense of community and encouragement, making it easier to stay committed to &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/healthy-eating-habits" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy habits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy habits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a strong social network can help provide outlets for healthier stress management. It’s also a place to share experiences, successes, and challenges with those on similar journeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Kateryna Onyshchuk/Istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Drink More Water&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay hydrated, primarily with plain water. &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/drinking-water-weight-loss" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt; is essential for health, but it also helps keep you fuller for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to sip on water throughout the day to keep cravings at bay. If your goal is weight loss, drink water right before or during meals to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4901052/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:help promote fullness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;help promote fullness&lt;/a&gt; and prevent overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get tired of plain water, try:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Ridofranz/istockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Finding the Healthiest Weight for You&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summing it up, the average weight for women in the U.S. is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:170.8 pounds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;170.8 pounds&lt;/a&gt;, but that doesn’t mean this is the ideal weight for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, there’s no “ideal” weight calculation that considers every woman’s body type or health requirements. And at the end of the day, health is more than a number on the scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While unrealistic beauty standards and societal pressures are pervasive, that doesn’t mean we have to accept them as the norm when examining the optimal weight range for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re on a mission to find the healthiest weight for you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prioritize healthy everyday habits&lt;/b&gt;. This means improving sleep, staying hydrated, nourishing your social connections, boosting your nutrition, and moving your body regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seek outside support&lt;/b&gt;. Friends and family can be excellent support systems, but sometimes professional health experts can offer invaluable guidance. Perhaps it makes sense for you to talk to a dietitian or connect with one of our licensed healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Focus on you.&lt;/b&gt; Weight management is personal. What’s most important is understanding your body and the best weight range for you personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/guides/emotional-balance" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Emotional Balance: Practical Tips For Uncertain Times;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Emotional Balance: Practical Tips For Uncertain Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/healthy-chicken-salad-recipe" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Recipe: Healthy Chicken Salad;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Recipe: Healthy Chicken Salad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.forhers.com/blog/average-weight-for-women" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Forhers.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Forhers.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; and was syndicated by &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://mediafeed.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:MediaFeed.org;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;MediaFeed.org&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 16:52:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE44UFkwZ0hOeWpGU3hXTE5HbEJBczFxZUM0eXlxeWw5MzUteUY2Z012STdDMXR6MGhkZEwzZzEzb0FNOHVNTnBZVURVWlppXzY2dHZwLU9mY0ZkMDBzekZhWDlSVF9OdUVYWTBpRWtlV2xuZw</guid></item><item><title>Texas Measles Outbreak Hits 400 Cases - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQLU9JTzd5RnRKdEx0dkhxVE1LYUlQSTJBWm9vZWR2N1BHZ0J5aDM3MDQzMmRSYkphR3BLdG1URVRpVmEzVVlhdlF2RThBQk5UMW56dEFNWHpFZVhlc3ZmNFc5akFTUk1uZFRid09jZ3Y1Tm9XTnlkeW5Sa3hYejJXM2dGd2JBdGVZWWVsZ21PQ2k4T3Z0dk12Qndla9IBoAFBVV95cUxOeGJfWE5fWHJpUEpUaHJwMnhhODZJbmR4ZTFTYmZJdzY2VHNCcFhYcFRfT3V4WXpaeDFWdmJ4a1JGdTdCM2lza2pQQm1PeFFFemp2aTQxa2NFRkY0T0dWU1UxZ2pPQXMybUZOOWsySk5RYTRlTkd1ZFc5SzBVMjFXMHJzenJPRjdyLVo3S3BNWjZYUGcyS3FQRFR4bDVfNVB3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big money interests are running the government — and influencing the news you read.

They also tend to have lower rates of high blood pressure and experience less physical pain. These findings come from a new population-based study published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/22423982.2024.2419698" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;International Journal of Circumpolar Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which compared people who sauna bathe regularly with those who do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most earlier findings on sauna use and health have been based on Finnish populations, where sauna bathing is deeply embedded in the culture. While northern Sweden also has a strong tradition of sauna use, little was known about how sauna habits relate to health in this population. The researchers wanted to understand whether regular sauna use was associated with measurable differences in physical and mental health and whether these associations held true outside of Finland. To do this, the research team used data from the &lt;a href="https://www.umu.se/en/research/infrastructure/norra-sveriges-monica-studie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2022 Northern Sweden MONICA study&lt;/a&gt;, a long-running health survey designed to monitor cardiovascular risk factors in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have done a lot of research on nursing in emergency and intensive care, but in recent years, I have developed a growing interest in health and nature,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.ltu.se/en/staff/a/asa-engstrom#h-Aboutme" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Åsa Engström&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the Luleå University of Technology. “In connection with that, I have read about the benefits of sauna bathing, such as its positive effects on cardiovascular health. We then had the opportunity to include questions about sauna bathing habits in the Northern Sweden MONICA Study, which allowed us to compare various health parameters between those who used saunas and those who did not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2022, a random sample of 1,180 adults aged 25 to 74 from the northern counties of Norrbotten and Västerbotten were invited to participate. Of these, 971 people (about 82 percent) answered questions about their sauna habits. Participants who reported sauna bathing at least once per month were categorized as “sauna bathers,” a group that made up 66 percent of the sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey collected a wide range of information, including demographic details, health status, lifestyle habits, and mental well-being. It also included specific questions about sauna use, such as how often participants used a sauna, how long they stayed in, the temperature of the sauna, and whether they bathed alone or with others. Other questions assessed participants’ levels of physical activity, smoking and drinking habits, sleep satisfaction, and experience of pain, anxiety, and depression. Participants also rated their general health, energy levels, and happiness on standard scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed several significant differences between people who used saunas regularly and those who did not. Sauna bathers were generally younger, more often male, and more likely to be physically active. They also smoked less, although they tended to drink alcohol more frequently—typically two to three times per week. Despite this, they reported better overall health. Compared to non-sauna bathers, they had lower rates of diagnosed high blood pressure and reported experiencing less physical pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health outcomes also differed between the two groups. Sauna bathers reported lower levels of anxiety and depression, and higher levels of energy and happiness. They also expressed greater satisfaction with their sleep patterns. Interestingly, these benefits were most noticeable among those who sauna bathed one to four times per month. Bathing more frequently than that did not lead to additional improvements in mental health or energy, and happiness scores were actually lower among those who used the sauna more than four times per month compared to moderate users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of sauna users in the study followed fairly typical sauna routines. Most stayed in the sauna for 15 to 20 minutes at a time, usually in one or two bouts per session. The temperature ranged between 60 and 80 degrees Celsius for most users, and electric saunas were the most common type. Most people bathed with others rather than alone, but relatively few combined sauna use with cold-water or ice swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that the association between sauna use and better health was not strongly tied to socioeconomic status. Sauna bathers and non-sauna bathers did not differ significantly in terms of education or where they lived. This suggests that the benefits seen among sauna bathers may not be explained solely by financial resources or living conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these results are consistent with previous studies suggesting health benefits from sauna use, the researchers caution that the study has limitations. One key limitation is its cross-sectional design, which means the data were collected at a single point in time. This makes it impossible to say whether sauna use causes better health, or whether healthier people are simply more likely to use saunas. Long-term studies or clinical trials would be needed to determine whether sauna use directly leads to health improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the group of sauna users tended to be younger and included more men, which may have influenced the results. Age and gender can both affect health outcomes independently of sauna use. Although the researchers compared groups statistically, more detailed analysis adjusting for these factors would be needed in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have begun analyzing more of the parameters in the MONICA data,” Engström said. “Our aim is to better understand the health effects of sauna bathing and how factors such as the environment and social context influence the experience. We have now developed a new survey on sauna bathing to help answer our research questions, and so far we have received nearly 400 responses. I am also conducting interviews with people, not only about sauna bathing but also about cold baths and winter bathing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/22423982.2024.2419698" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sauna bathing in northern Sweden: results from the MONICA study 2022&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Åsa Engström, Hans Hägglund, Earric Lee, Maria Wennberg, Stefan Söderberg, and Maria Andersson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 16:05:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQSzg4M1UzMzc3dC1oTlhmelBRYTV1dGZsY3k5NG9WNnFudV8xbzA4SWotRWFTNTJpTFdPR0NON2pWVGFNVVBValRsb1gyY0RCaEZjWHUxWXRKbmF4T1pDbWVWeldzWXlKM29qSndNWnBneGtBVWdxQXVteE5jT2IxMVI4YU5tc3pXTWJCYTBScFRubGVJendoS00yaHZjN21R</guid></item><item><title>This deadly, drug-resistant fungus is spreading.

Over time, my interest in the role of nutrition on sports performance and overall health grew, leading me to my current role as a dietitian. Instead of laminating pastry dough and frosting cakes, I’ve been able to merge my passions by creating desserts with benefits—aka sweet treats packed with nutrient-dense ingredients.  But let’s be real: Life gets busy, and I don’t always have time to whip up desserts and snacks. That’s why I’ve been hooked on &lt;a href="https://www.naturaldelights.com/products/cacao-pecan-mini-medjools" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Natural Delights Cacao Pecan Mini Medjools;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Natural Delights Cacao Pecan Mini Medjools&lt;/a&gt;, which can be found right in the produce aisle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These brownie-inspired date bites bring just the right combination of flavors and textures to the table: sweet, chocolaty, caramel-like, nutty, chewy and crunchy.  Craving a candy bar? The combination of a dense, chewy, caramel-like texture, rich, chocolaty flavor and satisfying crunch is sure to do the trick. Plus, this snack is made from just four simple ingredients and is free from added sugar and artificial additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hungry yet?  Join me as I dive into why this high-fiber, dessert-like snack is one that I never leave the grocery store without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Natural Delights Cacoa Pecan Mini Medjools Is a Great High-Fiber Snack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon. EatingWell design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It’s Filling and Satisfying&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to filling power, some snacks just don’t cut it. But that’s not the case with these Mini Medjools. Each bite-size piece packs a trio of nutrients—complex carbs, protein and fiber—that work together to keep you full for longer and truly satisfied. Specifically, each four-piece serving provides 24 grams of carbohydrates, 5 grams of fiber and 3 grams of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It’s Blood Sugar–Friendly&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The snack’s combination of fiber and protein also helps to slow digestion, providing a steady release of sugar without causing large swings in your blood sugar levels. While you might worry that dates are off-limits if you have diabetes, they’re actually an incredibly nutrient-dense way to add sweetness without using added sugars. Plus, one review found that eating dates may actually help lower blood sugar levels, thanks to their high fiber content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It’s High in Fiber&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, this chewy snack is packed with an impressive 5 grams of fiber per four-piece serving. In addition to minimizing blood sugar spikes and increasing satiety, fiber plays an important role in heart and digestive health. Specifically, dates are high in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insoluble fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which helps prevent constipation and may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It Provides Several Essential Nutrients&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to fiber, these brownie-inspired bites contain numerous other important nutrients, largely thanks to their three main ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medjool dates &lt;/strong&gt;are a sweet source of complex carbohydrates, fiber and micronutrients like potassium, magnesium, folate, copper, calcium and iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pecans &lt;/strong&gt;are often overlooked except during the holidays (hello, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/276928/mini-pecan-pies/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pecan pie!;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;pecan pie!&lt;/a&gt;). However, these buttery nuts provide heart-healthy unsaturated fats, fiber, plant-based protein and a wealth of micronutrients like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-when-you-consume-vitamin-e-regularly-8685814" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin E;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin E&lt;/a&gt;, copper and zinc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cacao powder and nibs &lt;/strong&gt;are packed with antioxidants, specifically flavonols, which protect against cell damage and support heart health. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013599/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-chocolate-every-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cacoa;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cacoa&lt;/a&gt; also contains fiber and micronutrients like magnesium and potassium.,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It Has Benefits for Your Heart&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fiber-rich snack isn’t just good for digestion, it’s also good for your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/heart-healthy-high-fiber-snack-recipes-8700225" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;.

For example, one study found that adults at risk for heart disease who swapped their usual snacks with pecans for 12 weeks saw meaningful reductions in cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Meanwhile, cacao’s &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2051586/best-antioxidant-rich-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:flavonoid;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;flavonoid&lt;/a&gt; content may help reduce chronic inflammation, lower triglyceride levels and improve blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Choose a High-Fiber Snack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snack time is a great opportunity to increase the amount of fiber in your diet; the key is knowing what to look for. Here are a few tips for choosing a nutritious, high-fiber snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for 3 grams of fiber per serving or more&lt;/strong&gt;: Specifically, look for snacks containing at least 3 grams of fiber per serving. While some snacks are fortified, others contain natural fiber sources, like fruits, veggies, lentils, nuts, seeds and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit added sugars: &lt;/strong&gt;Ideally, look for snacks that are naturally sweetened with fruit and limit those containing high amounts of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7912011/whats-the-big-deal-about-sugar-we-have-your-questions-answered/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:added sugar.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;added sugar.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention to the ingredient list: &lt;/strong&gt;In general, snacks with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-fiber-snack-recipes-with-3-ingredients-or-less-8725256" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:short, simple ingredient lists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;short, simple ingredient lists&lt;/a&gt; are less likely to contain artificial additives or preservatives. They often tend to be lower in added sugar and unhealthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose whole grains: &lt;/strong&gt;Whole grain–based snacks are typically higher in fiber and other essential nutrients than their refined counterparts. Whole-grain crackers, oat-based granola bars and popcorn are all great &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7898414/what-are-whole-grains/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:whole-grain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;whole-grain&lt;/a&gt; options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include protein&lt;/strong&gt;: The combination of protein and fiber can be especially helpful for satiety and managing blood sugar levels. Nuts, seeds, nut butters, trail mixes, edamame, roasted chickpeas and hummus are all great examples of foods offering this beneficial duo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for fruit- or vegetable-based options:&lt;/strong&gt; Fruits and vegetables are important sources of fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Look for snacks that incorporate them in any form—fresh, frozen, dried or canned. For example, a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8034765/a-month-of-veggie-packed-smoothies/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;smoothie&lt;/a&gt; is a refreshing way to add a dose of both fruit and leafy greens, while fruit leathers and dehydrated veggie chips are good for taking on the go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next time you’re in the produce department, don’t forget to grab a container of Natural Delights Cacao Pecan Mini Medjools.

Even the healthiest of diets like the &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/goodbye-excess-salt-dash-diet-090810042.html" data-ylk="slk:DASH diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt; recommends limiting sodium intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though some dietary exclusions make more sense than others, a few foods seem to be recommended against especially often. One of the most targeted nutrients of many of the most popular diets is carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are carbs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates, commonly called carbs, are the sugars in specific foods. The are important because they are the body's main source of energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of carbs: simple and complex. Simple carbs are natural, digestible sugars such as ones found in foods like milk (lactose), table sugar (sucrose) and fruit (fructose). Complex carbs are starches and the fibrous parts of food that the body doesn't digest. Complex carbs are commonly found in starchy vegetables like potatoes and corn or processed grains like rice, bread, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/cereal-good-watch-added-sugars-090401730.html" data-ylk="slk:cereals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;cereals&lt;/a&gt; and pasta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both simple and complex carbs are broken down by the body into glucose, which gets transported to cells, muscle and organs to provide energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="exclude-from-newsgate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red meat: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/americans-consume-lot-red-meat-090316085.html" data-ylk="slk:Americans consume a lot of it.

Here's why we shouldn't.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is a low-carb diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A low-carb diet aims to limit the amount of carbohydrates you eat. Most healthy adults eat between 225 and 325 grams of carbohydrates a day, but low-carb diets recommend significantly reducing this amount to no more than 130 grams daily. "Some are restricted to as low as 20 to 60 grams of carbohydrates per day," says Leslie Bonci, a sports dietitian for the &lt;a href="https://sportsdata.usatoday.com/football/nfl/teams/kansas-city-chiefs/339" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kansas City Chiefs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kansas City Chiefs&lt;/a&gt; and founder of &lt;a href="https://activeeatingadvice.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Active Eating Advice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Active Eating Advice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such restrictions occur by cutting down on candy and sugary drinks, starchy vegetables and processed grains. A food's "Total Carbohydrates" are listed on its &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/reading-nutrition-labels-improve-overall-091227405.html" data-ylk="slk:Nutrition Facts label;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;Nutrition Facts label&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/reading-nutrition-labels-improve-overall-091227405.html" data-ylk="slk:.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dieters are encouraged to replace high-carb foods with low-carb alternatives such as chicken, seafood and lean beef, plus fruits like apricots, oranges, avocados, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/know-raspberries-yes-theyre-good-090053138.html" data-ylk="slk:raspberries;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;raspberries&lt;/a&gt; and lemons. Vegetables like broccoli, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, kale and &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/yes-asparagus-good-heres-why-090121497.html" data-ylk="slk:asparagus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;asparagus&lt;/a&gt; are also included in most low-carb diets—as are eggs, cheese, Greek yogurt and nuts like walnuts, peanuts, macadamia nuts and pistachios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The focus of a low-carb diet is on &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/building-muscle-requires-higher-protein-100105255.html" data-ylk="slk:eating more protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;eating more protein&lt;/a&gt; and fat for nutrients and energy instead of high-carb foods," says &lt;a href="https://drlisayoung.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lisa Young;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lisa Young&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist, author of "Finally Full, Finally Slim" and an adjunct professor of nutrition at New York University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most common low-carb diets include the ketogenic (keto) diet, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/pros-cons-paleo-diet-experts-100031475.html" data-ylk="slk:the Paleo diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;the Paleo diet&lt;/a&gt;, the South Beach diet, the Dukan diet and the Atkins diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="exclude-from-newsgate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good question: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/yes-asparagus-good-heres-why-090121497.html" data-ylk="slk:Yes, asparagus is good for you.

But here's why you should avoid overconsumption.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are low-carb diets good or bad for you?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most diets, there are advantages and disadvantages of low-carb dieting. Some of the benefits include decreased risk of certain mental and physical health conditions, improved blood pressure and reduced calorie intake—which can help with weight loss. Young says that low-carb diets can also be helpful for &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/glucose-levels-important-manage-heres-101528912.html" data-ylk="slk:blood sugar regulation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;blood sugar regulation&lt;/a&gt; as they recommend foods low on the glycemic index and they usually provide lowered triglycerides—a type of fat in the blood that can increase your risk for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on higher amounts of fat and protein "may also result in feeling fuller for longer and less hungry between meals," says Bonci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But low-carb diets can also be disadvantageous by being "hard to sustain and may unnecessarily restrict nutrient-dense foods like fruits, beans and whole grains," says Young. Such foods, she says, "are essential for everyday gut health, heart health and overall well-being."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longterm adherence to stricter low-carb diets, Young adds, can also "lead to increased cholesterol levels from excessive saturated fat and nutritional deficiencies." Low-carb diets have also been clinically associated with &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/05/04/constipation-vibrating-capsule/8513473/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:constipation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt; (due to the lack of fiber), moodiness and increased risk of kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonci points out that low-carb diets can also be pricey, "as typically carbohydrate-containing foods are less expensive than protein food," she says. Some brand name low-carb diets—especially ones with designated meal plans—can get costly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, "being mindful of excessive carbs is smart, but balance is key as overly restrictive diets can backfire," cautions Young. "A sustainable, healthy diet includes a variety of nutrient-rich foods in balanced portions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/03/29/what-is-a-low-carb-diet/82560369007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What is a low carb diet?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What is a low carb diet?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 14:37:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9SdGFjUlNmbm93dWdqWUs2SFlXRkJNUUFIOHJHbHVFeEVNUllhOTllSm10dG5iN3c3WUsza2hHZjhod05iOWplYzUweURPOV9qSExxZW1qb1JIRzJrVlFfSTJ1RVhLY2RtVFNNblhtRnV1cEVKd0hBOWk2dw</guid></item><item><title>I'm a longevity doctor - these 8 'superstar' spices can help you beat cancer, stave off Alzheimer's and lower - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Longevity expert Dr. Michael Aziz may have been born 60 years ago - but he claims his biological age is almost a decade younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The New York City-based physician attributes much of his good health to a clean diet, good sleep, and regular exercise that focuses on cardio and resistance training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he also credits eight 'superstar' spices with helping him turn back the clock, though others in the medical community say there isn't enough scientific evidence to back these claims. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor came up with the list after studying the diets of people who live in &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-13117099/Food-choices-lead-longer-happier-life.html"&gt;Blue Zones&lt;/a&gt;, areas around the world where people live longer than average - often into their hundreds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He claims the spices provide a wealth of benefits - such as lowering inflammation and slashing the risk of diseases like &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-03ae9b60-ee4a-11ef-9fb5-cd5f19dc8d4f" class="class"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; - though experts are torn on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aziz's personal aim is to consume all eight every week. While he takes three of them - turmeric, saffron, and garlic - as pills every day, you should consult your doctor before taking any new supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking to DailyMail.com, Dr. Aziz said: 'Of course, you can't just have the spices - you have to eat the greens and avoid the chemicals and all the ultra-processed foods too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But spices are the anti-aging add-ons. They are like the superstars, the supernovas, for combatting aging.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Below, DailyMail.com details Dr. Aziz's favorite supplements.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Michael Aziz reveals how to reset the biological clock and improve your health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Turmeric: Boost muscles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Famous for its earthy flavor and orange-yellow color, turmeric is a staple in many Southeastern Asian dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rhizome (a root-like underground stem) contains the compound curcumin, which scientists say can help slash levels of inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several reviews have also suggested curcumin 'improves muscular performance' and helps them to recover after vigorous exercise - linking this to its anti-inflammatory effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above image shows a variety of turmeric spices, which are said to contain anti-inflammatory properties &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One&lt;a target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00812-6"&gt; 2017 research study from&lt;/a&gt;, which administered turmeric oil to mice, also concluded the spice has anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The papers suggest people consume one to four grams of curcumin - at least 33 grams of turmeric or 11 teaspoons worth - per day to achieve these benefits. Or, you can take curcumin supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Turmeric has previously been held up as a possible treatment for the 53 million adults in the US who suffer from arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the Arthritis Foundation pushed back against the claims, saying it&lt;span&gt; 'only contains about two to six percent curcumin, so you're not getting much [of the anti-inflammatory effect].'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The group explained that simply adding turmeric to your favorite meal would do little as the curcumin levels would be so low. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, it is a must-have in Aziz's longevity kitchen. He consumes it daily either in pill form or as a shot or small juice drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Garlic: Wrinkle eradicator&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Garlic is one of eight spices Dr. Michael Aziz claims can help you live longer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Garlic is considered to be a superfood worldwide, with many experts suggesting it can lower inflammation, blood pressure and boost the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aziz suggests the allium can be used to help prevent wrinkles, though Brooklyn-based Dr. Mert Erogul and others remain skeptical about the claim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says that garlic contains a compound called allicin, which contains sulfur. Sulfur plays a key role in creating and maintaining collagen, which keeps the skin elastic and firm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Erogul told DailyMail.com, 'It is a significant leap to assert that garlic can prevent wrinkles ... even if there's some theoretical justification for the claim. Although, to be clear, I am not sure that there is in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ultimately, the only way we can know whether these claims are true is by putting them to the test - definitive proof that a substance has a specific health effect typically requires costly and extensive controlled trials.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aziz takes a garlic pill every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Aziz also recommended cinnamon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Cinnamon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cinnamon is a favorite spice used for flavoring food and drinks, but it's also been revered by many communities for centuries because of its medicinal properties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists believe cinnamaldehyde - a compound found in the oils of the dried plant - is responsible for much of the spice's health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cinnamon is high in antioxidants, and has also been linked to reducing triglycerides, cholesterol, and blood sugar, according to studies reviewed by &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-proven-benefits-of-cinnamon#TOC_TITLE_HDR_5"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Dr. Aziz believes it may reduce the risk of someone developing Alzheimer's disease - he pointed to a &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1043661817311659"&gt;few lab studies&lt;/a&gt; showing cinnamon could prevent the formation of tau proteins, which form clumps in the brain - there is no evidence to support it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists say more research is needed, and Dr. Erogul described the claim as another 'significant leap.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Ginger &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ginger is packed with nutrients that Dr. Aziz claims can reduce inflammation in the brain &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ginger is popular for its anti-nausea effects and has also been used medicinally for centuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some people may experience side effects after consuming either fresh or dried ginger, its compounds are generally known to have positive effects on digestion and the ability to settle an upset stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ginger-for-nausea#effectiveness"&gt;Healthline reports&lt;/a&gt; there are certain groups of people (those with gallbladder disease, people who are pregnant and have a history of miscarriage, anyone taking blood thinners, and more) who should be cautious and consult with their doctors when deciding whether to consume ginger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aziz says he always orders a ginger shot whenever he visits his local juice bar, but does not consume it every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He suggests it can help prevent mental decline, but experts say more research is needed, and that its mental health benefits have not yet been proven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Ginseng&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists found that the Ginseng plant (pictured) contains 50 types of ginsenosides - the compound linked to boosted health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ginseng has been used in Chinese medicine for more than 100 years, and is credited with a wide range of health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Made from the roots of the ginseng plant, scientists found it contains 50 types of ginsenosides - compounds linked to boosted health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mount Sinai in New York compiled a long list of ailments the root may be able to help alleviate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The healthcare organization also said there is 'some evidence' Asian ginseng can help boost the immune system, reduce the risk of cancer, and improve mental performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;American ginseng contains the same components but in different amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1226845324000344"&gt;2024 review&lt;/a&gt; found older adults taking American ginseng had improved cognition, especially when it was taken alongside early Alzheimer's drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16566675/"&gt;a 2006 study&lt;/a&gt; found that COLD-FX, a dietary supplement that contains extract of North American ginseng, could reduce the risk of catching a cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But scientists cautioned these were only preliminary findings and that more research is needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aziz believes the root 'can help lower [blood] sugar levels, lower cholesterol, promote relaxation, improves sexual dysfunction in men, and is used to treat a wide range of medical conditions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Cardamom&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Antioxidants found in cardamom (pictured) could help to lower blood pressure, Dr. Aziz said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another ancient spice believed to have healing properties, cardamom is often added to curries, cookies, sweets, coffee, and spiced cakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aziz says it may be able to act as a blood pressure reducer, though Dr. Erogul said he wanted to see larger scale trials take place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fsn3.3738"&gt;2023 review&lt;/a&gt; found patients who took cardamom had significantly lower inflammation and blood pressure compared to those who did not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review included more than 500 patients, who were mostly overweight or obese. Many had type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Saffron&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Saffron is extremely highly regarded in many cultures and has a huge presence in Persian and Middle Eastern foods. It's also expensive to buy, compared to the rest of the grocery store's spice rack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows saffron, which is from a crocus flower&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it does not directly combat aging, Dr. Aziz said there is an established link between taking the spice and a better mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4643654/"&gt;A meta-analysis of five studies&lt;/a&gt; previously found saffron supplements were more effective than placebos at easing mild to moderate depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One paper claimed the spice is as effective as common antidepressants like fluoxetine - sold under the brand name Prozac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6503633/#:~:text=Conclusion%3A%20The%20findings%20of%20this,comparable%20with%20Fluoxetine%20and%20placebo."&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;included nearly 200 people who took saffron for six to 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In its conclusion, researchers said: 'The findings of this study showed that saffron administration was well comparable with Fluoxetine and placebo.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists said it may have these effects because the spice contains the compound crocin, which a 2022 review suggested can boost nerves in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added this could boost levels of the feel-good hormone serotonin, improving someone's mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aziz takes a saffron supplement every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Za'atar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Za'atar has been linked to anti-aging properties&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This Middle Eastern spice blend varies by region, but often includes oregano, thyme, sesame seeds, and sumac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With its antioxidant levels, za'atar has been linked to a range of anti-aging properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oregano contains polyphenols like flavonoids, which can help to reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thyme also contains substances that reduce inflammation - as does sumac, which is extremely high in antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2022 &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464622000639#s0125"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found compounds in za'atar regulate the gut microbiome, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It&lt;span&gt; is a 'blend of anti-aging weapons from all over the world,' Dr. Aziz says. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Carrots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Carrots are jam-packed with vitamin A, an important nutrient for vision, growth, cell division, reproduction and immunity, according to the Mayo Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-021-01063-3"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; that root vegetables are also filled with microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's because plants absorb microplastics in water and soil through their roots, and the majority of these particles become concentrated in this part of the plant with only a tiny amount travelling up to the shoots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, leafy vegetables such as lettuces and cabbage contain lower amounts of microplastics compared to root vegetables such as carrots, radishes and turnips, according to one study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you want to reduce your microplastics intake by eating fewer carrots, but still want a healthy dose of vitamin A in your diet, try swapping them out for spinach or red, yellow and orange bell peppers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;2. Plant-based nuggets  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A study that tested different types of proteins for microplastic contamination found that plant-based nuggets contained the second-highest amount of plastic particles &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749123022352"&gt;Researchers tested different types of proteins for microplastic contamination&lt;/a&gt;, and found that plant-based nuggets are one of the main culprits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the four different plant-based proteins they tested, the chicken nugget alternatives had the highest level of microplastics contamination at 0.32 particles per gram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is due to the fact that these nuggets are highly processed and tend to be packaged in plastic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rather than buying processed, packaged plant-based nuggets at the store, trying making them at home using tofu or seitan to reduce your plastic consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;3. Apples &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An apple a day keeps the doctor away, or so the saying goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this popular fruit actually contains more microplastics than any other, with one &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120305703"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;finding they have more than 100,000 particles per gram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like carrots, apple trees absorb microplastics through their roots, which ultimately find their way into the fruit they produce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you want a safer alternative, choose fruits that contain anthocyanins, a type of antioxidant that may protect the body against some of the harmful effects of microplastics, according to new research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some examples of Anthocyanin-packed fruits include blueberries, cranberries, pomegranates and grapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;4. Rice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One study has shown that people consume three to four milligrams of plastic for every 100 grams of rice they eat, and instant rice is worse &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rice is a healthy source of carbohydrates, fiber and B vitamins. But eating it also gives you a dose of plastic contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://stories.uq.edu.au/news/2021/instant-rice-packs-a-plastic-punchinstant-rice-packs-a-plastic-punch/index.html"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;has shown that people consume three to four milligrams of plastic for every 100 grams of rice they eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And when it comes to instant rice, that number jumps to 13 milligrams per serving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rice picks up plastic particles from the soil it grows in, the machines used to pick, store and move it, as well as the processing, packaging and handling it goes through before ending up on your plate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study found that washing rice before cooking it reduces plastic contamination by 20 to 40 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;5. Bottled water&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This one will come as no surprise. Water packaged in plastic bottles is teeming with microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/plastic-particles-bottled-water#:~:text=The%20researchers%20found%20that%2C%20on,mostly%20focused%20on%20larger%20microplastics."&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found that on average, a liter of bottled water contained about 240,000 plastic particles, and about 90 percent of them were nanoplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nanoplastics are 150 times smaller than a hair, and research suggests they are small enough to get inside human cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fortunately, it's easy to eliminate plastic-bottled water from your life by purchasing a reusable water bottle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;6. Ready-to-eat salads&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It's difficult to pinpoint exactly how many microplastics are packed into these quick, light lunches, as they vary widely in terms of packaging, size and ingredients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like bottled water, the microplastic contamination in ready-to-eat salads stems from the packaging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's difficult to pinpoint exactly how many microplastics are packed into these quick, light lunches, as they vary widely in terms of packaging, size and ingredients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But its inevitable that tiny pieces of the plastic packaging will shed into your salad. So if you want to avoid them, it's best to make your own salad using fresh, washed vegetables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;7. Seafood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0281596"&gt;recent study &lt;/a&gt;showed that the amount of microplastics in the ocean has been doubling every six years over the last four decades, and those particles make their way into our seafood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clams, mussels, crabs and nearly every type of fish are a few examples of seafoods that contain very high amounts of microplastics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, one &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9819327/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20in%20European%20countries,still%20represents%20a%20considerable%20exposure%20%5B"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;estimated that people who eat large amounts of shellfish ingest about 11,000 microplastic particles each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unfortunately, there is not an easy swap for seafood, as microplastics can be found in practically every kind of fish and shellfish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But you can reduce your microplastics intake by cutting back on your seafood consumption and trying to avoid highly processed fish, such as frozen fish filets.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;8. Pink Himalayan sea salt &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Highly-processed American table salt is the safest option when it comes to microplastic contamination&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pink Himalayan sea salt is widely considered healthy because it is minimally processed and therefore contains more minerals that the body needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But interestingly, researchers have found that processed salt contains far fewer microplastics than less processed salts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, one &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46173"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found that highly-processed, conventional table salt in the US contained significantly fewer microplastics than minimally processed salts, such as those used in Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's because unrefined salts contain plastic pollution from the oceans they are harvested from, and in this case, processing actually works to remove much of those microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pink Himalayan sea salt is especially high in microplastics both because it is unrefined and because of the mining methods used to extract it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thus, highly processed American table salt is the safest option when it comes to avoiding microplastic contamination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;9. Processed dairy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the exception of salt, highly processed foods generally contain more microplastics, and this is definitely true for conventional dairy products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have shown that highly processed dairy products such as powdered cheese and conventional milk contain significantly more microplastics than minimally processed alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To reduce your microplastics intake from dairy, reach for locally-sourced, organic milk, cheese and yoghurt at the store instead of the processed stuff.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;10.  Tea in nylon bags &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nylon mesh tea bags release billions of micro- and nanoplastics into a single cup of tea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nylon tea bags release tons of microplastics into your hot cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31552738/"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found that steeping a single nylon mesh tea bag in 200°F water releases roughly 11.6 billion microplastics and 3.1 billion nanoplastics into a cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using tea in paper tea bags, or loose leaf tea and a reusable stainless steel strainer, are much safer options when it comes to limiting microplastic exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;11. Seaweed &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just like seafood and sea salts, microplastics make their way into seaweed products too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These particles become trapped on the surface of seaweed, clinging to its tiny crevices and fibers. One &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030881462400966X"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found that conventional washing methods are ineffective in removing most microplastics from seaweed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seaweed is eaten all over the world, but is a predominant staple of Asian diets. That same study found that people in China consume more than 17,000 microplastics per person per year through seaweed consumption alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That represents 13 percent of their total annual microplastics intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you love seaweed-wrapped sushi but want to cut down on your microplastics consumption, try making it with rice paper, lettuce or thinly-sliced cucumbers instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;12. Honey&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One study found that honey made in urban environments contained far more microplastics than honey made in rural environments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have tested honey from all over the world for microplastics, and found that this food staple is widely contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this case, the microplastic pollution does not come from processing, but rather the bees themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When honeybees forage for pollen in polluted environments, they pick up plastic particles that eventually make their way into the honey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is likely why one &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://12ft.io/proxy"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found that honey made in urban environments contained far more microplastics than honey made in rural environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, you can cut down on your plastic consumption by purchasing honey made in rural locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A contraceptive implant is a thin and flexible rod that sits under the skin and releases contraceptive drugs into the body for years. While it’s one of the &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/contraception/choosing-contraception/how-well-it-works-at-preventing-pregnancy/"&gt;most effective forms of contraceptives&lt;/a&gt; and avoids the inconvenience of having to take a pill every day, the implant requires minor surgery, which can limit accessibility. To make life a bit easier, researchers are creating a self-assembling contraceptive implant the components of which women could self-administer with a single injection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A team of researchers has developed the technology for self-injectable contraceptive shots that work similarly to contraceptive implants. As detailed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44286-025-00194-x"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published Monday in the journal Nature Chemical Engineering, the shots would result in a highly effective and long-term contraceptive method more accessible to women who lack easy access to medical infrastructure. Additionally, the design could be used to administer other long-term medications, such as those for HIV.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new approach delivers the contraceptive hormonal medication levonorgestrel via what the researchers call “Self-assembling Long-acting Injectable Microcrystals” (SLIM). Once injected into the body, the tiny crystals assemble into an implant, or a drug “depot,” that releases levonorgestrel as it erodes over months or years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="not-prose video-container"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;iframe title="Self-Aggregating Long-Acting Injectable Microcystals" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BnK_HjO76Jk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The overarching goal is to give women access to a lot of different formats for contraception that are easy to administer, compatible with being used in the developing world, and have a range of different timeframes of durations of action,” Vivian Feig, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University and co-author on the study, said in a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/engineers-develop-better-way-to-deliver-long-lasting-drugs-0324"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Traditional &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/4086-depo-provera-birth-control-shot"&gt;birth control shots&lt;/a&gt; already exist and are more accessible than the contraceptive implant because patients can give themselves the shots without having to visit a hospital or medical clinic. However, they are slightly less effective than the implant and are not long-lasting, so they must be administered every three months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers’ new contraceptive design joins the accessibility of self-administered shots with the long-term efficacy of an implant. The challenge of self-administering technologies similar to SLIM, however, has been the large (and hence painful) needle size necessary to inject the medication. By contrast, the team’s formula—tiny crystals and a solvent (in this case a liquid compound called benzyl benzoate)—allows for the use of much smaller needles.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Needle size and liquid viscosity are crucial considerations for commercial translation of injectables,” said Giovanni Traverso, senior author of the study and a gastroenterologist at MIT and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in a Mass General Brigham &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/new-non-surgical-contraceptive-implant-delivered-through-tiny-needles"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Our engineering challenge was finding a way to maximize comfort for patients by using smaller needles, which cause less bruising or bleeding, and to make the viscosity low enough for easy application with the syringe by hand.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Traverso and his colleagues can modify the mixture to “modulate the drug release rate, extending its duration while maintaining injectability,” MIT graduate student Sanghyun Park explained in the MIT statement. “This demonstrates the tunability of our system, which can be engineered to accommodate a broader range of contraceptive needs as well as tailored dosing regimens for other therapeutic applications.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While SLIM hasn’t gone through clinical trials yet, the development of the technology in preclinical models paves the way for more convenient and effective future long-term medications.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; My childhood dream was to go to pastry school to create beautiful, delicious desserts. Over time, my interest in the role of nutrition on sports performance and overall health grew, leading me to my current role as a dietitian. Instead of laminating pastry dough and frosting cakes, I’ve been able to merge my passions by creating desserts with benefits—aka sweet treats packed with nutrient-dense ingredients.  But let’s be real: Life gets busy, and I don’t always have time to whip up desserts and snacks. That’s why I’ve been hooked on &lt;a href="https://www.naturaldelights.com/products/cacao-pecan-mini-medjools" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Natural Delights Cacao Pecan Mini Medjools&lt;/a&gt;, which can be found right in the produce aisle.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These brownie-inspired date bites bring just the right combination of flavors and textures to the table: sweet, chocolaty, caramel-like, nutty, chewy and crunchy.  Craving a candy bar? The combination of a dense, chewy, caramel-like texture, rich, chocolaty flavor and satisfying crunch is sure to do the trick. Plus, this snack is made from just four simple ingredients and is free from added sugar and artificial additives.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to filling power, some snacks just don’t cut it. But that’s not the case with these Mini Medjools. Each bite-size piece packs a trio of nutrients—complex carbs, protein and fiber—that work together to keep you full for longer and truly satisfied. Specifically, each four-piece serving provides 24 grams of carbohydrates, 5 grams of fiber and 3 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Blood Sugar–Friendly &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The snack’s combination of fiber and protein also helps to slow digestion, providing a steady release of sugar without causing large swings in your blood sugar levels. While you might worry that dates are off-limits if you have diabetes, they’re actually an incredibly nutrient-dense way to add sweetness without using added sugars. Plus, one review found that eating dates may actually help lower blood sugar levels, thanks to their high fiber content.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Speaking of which, this chewy snack is packed with an impressive 5 grams of fiber per four-piece serving. In addition to minimizing blood sugar spikes and increasing satiety, fiber plays an important role in heart and digestive health. Specifically, dates are high in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which helps prevent constipation and may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to fiber, these brownie-inspired bites contain numerous other important nutrients, largely thanks to their three main ingredients:

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medjool dates &lt;/strong&gt;are a sweet source of complex carbohydrates, fiber and micronutrients like potassium, magnesium, folate, copper, calcium and iron.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pecans &lt;/strong&gt;are often overlooked except during the holidays (hello, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/276928/mini-pecan-pies/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pecan pie!&lt;/a&gt;). However, these buttery nuts provide heart-healthy unsaturated fats, fiber, plant-based protein and a wealth of micronutrients like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-when-you-consume-vitamin-e-regularly-8685814" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin E&lt;/a&gt;, copper and zinc.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cacao powder and nibs &lt;/strong&gt;are packed with antioxidants, specifically flavonols, which protect against cell damage and support heart health. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013599/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-chocolate-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Cacoa&lt;/a&gt; also contains fiber and micronutrients like magnesium and potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A fiber-rich snack isn’t just good for digestion, it’s also good for your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/heart-healthy-high-fiber-snack-recipes-8700225" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;. One study found that dates may improve heart health by lowering triglyceride, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/hdl-vs-ldl-cholesterol-whats-the-difference-11678853" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and total cholesterol levels while boosting beneficial HDL cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The snack’s inclusion of cacao and pecans further boosts its heart-healthy benefits. For example, one study found that adults at risk for heart disease who swapped their usual snacks with pecans for 12 weeks saw meaningful reductions in cholesterol and triglyceride levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Meanwhile, cacao’s &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2051586/best-antioxidant-rich-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;flavonoid&lt;/a&gt; content may help reduce chronic inflammation, lower triglyceride levels and improve blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-choose-a-high-fiber-snack"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt;  How to Choose a High-Fiber Snack &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;  Snack time is a great opportunity to increase the amount of fiber in your diet; the key is knowing what to look for. Here are a few tips for choosing a nutritious, high-fiber snack. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for 3 grams of fiber per serving or more&lt;/strong&gt;: Specifically, look for snacks containing at least 3 grams of fiber per serving. While some snacks are fortified, others contain natural fiber sources, like fruits, veggies, lentils, nuts, seeds and whole grains.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit added sugars: &lt;/strong&gt;Ideally, look for snacks that are naturally sweetened with fruit and limit those containing high amounts of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7912011/whats-the-big-deal-about-sugar-we-have-your-questions-answered/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;added sugar.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention to the ingredient list: &lt;/strong&gt;In general, snacks with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-fiber-snack-recipes-with-3-ingredients-or-less-8725256" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;short, simple ingredient lists&lt;/a&gt; are less likely to contain artificial additives or preservatives. They often tend to be lower in added sugar and unhealthy fats. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose whole grains: &lt;/strong&gt;Whole grain–based snacks are typically higher in fiber and other essential nutrients than their refined counterparts. Whole-grain crackers, oat-based granola bars and popcorn are all great &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7898414/what-are-whole-grains/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;whole-grain&lt;/a&gt; options. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include protein&lt;/strong&gt;: The combination of protein and fiber can be especially helpful for satiety and managing blood sugar levels. Nuts, seeds, nut butters, trail mixes, edamame, roasted chickpeas and hummus are all great examples of foods offering this beneficial duo.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for fruit- or vegetable-based options:&lt;/strong&gt; Fruits and vegetables are important sources of fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Look for snacks that incorporate them in any form—fresh, frozen, dried or canned. For example, a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8034765/a-month-of-veggie-packed-smoothies/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;smoothie&lt;/a&gt; is a refreshing way to add a dose of both fruit and leafy greens, while fruit leathers and dehydrated veggie chips are good for taking on the go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;  Next time you’re in the produce department, don’t forget to grab a container of Natural Delights Cacao Pecan Mini Medjools. Packed with fiber and with a wonderfully chewy consistency, this snack offers numerous health benefits in a small, yet satisfying package.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been five years since the start of a zoonotic COVID-19 pandemic that &lt;a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;killed millions of people&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the United Nations is urging member governments to take coordinated action to address &lt;a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/03/1161186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the “unprecedented” spread of highly pathogenic bird flu&lt;/a&gt; — a threat to health, food security, biodiversity and more. The world has reached an inflection point, another chance to do what is needed to prevent a health crisis.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will either be remembered as the moment we failed to save lives or the moment we finally reckoned with the dangers of factory farming and our mass exploitation of animals. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The warning from the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization came on March 17, the same day the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-reported-first-outbreak-h7n9-bird-flu-farm-since-2017-woah-says-2025-03-17/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a new U.S. outbreak of dangerous H7N9 bird flu&lt;/a&gt; was reported. Since it first emerged in 2013, the strain has a nearly 40 percent mortality rate in humans, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/westernpacific/wpro-emergencies/surveillance/avian-influenza"&gt;translating to 616 human deaths&lt;/a&gt; in China. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite troubling signs that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/severe-bird-flu-cases-virus-can-mutate-lingers-body-rcna186009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the virus is mutating and could become more transmissible&lt;/a&gt;, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s $1 billion strategy to fight bird flu is &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trumps-plan-combat-bird-flu-will-ensure-more-bird-flu-opinion-2042335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;likely to create more danger,&lt;/a&gt; as the federal agency funnels $400 million into factory farms as reimbursements for chickens lost. In so doing, it is propping up the very industry fueling the spread of zoonotic disease.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since early 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nearly 170 million farmed birds have died or been killed&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. due to bird flu outbreaks, equivalent to roughly half the country’s human population. Just since last year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;70 human cases&lt;/a&gt; have been reported, the majority of which resulted from direct exposure to livestock. Three came from unknown sources. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We already know that &lt;a href="https://www.emro.who.int/fr/about-who/rc61/zoonotic-diseases.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;75 percent of emerging human pathogens are zoonotic&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, by farming animals in the billions, we are playing with fire. Factory farms confine thousands of animals into unsanitary facilities, where workers are &lt;a href="https://investigatemidwest.org/2024/12/04/bird-flu-ppe-access-in-dairy-producing-states/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;often left unprotected&lt;/a&gt; from disease.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While some have blamed wild birds for the presence of bird flu on large-scale farms, it is more likely that &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/can-wild-birds-spread-avian-influenza-domestic-poultry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;failures to prevent diseases from spreading on farms are the real culprits&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, research has shown that &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250224/Study-finds-strong-evidence-that-bird-flu-spreads-through-the-air-between-farms.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ventilation systems on factory farms may be fueling airborne transmission&lt;/a&gt; of bird flu; &lt;a href="https://time.com/7212477/wastewater-testing-farms-bird-flu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;scientists are currently tracking&lt;/a&gt; wastewater from these intensive operations as a potential avenue for the virus’s spread. The hazards of factory farms themselves are compounded by the clearing of forests for animal agriculture, which diminishes planetary resilience and pushes humans and wildlife into &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/analysis-how-deforestation-helps-deadly-viruses-jump-from-animals-to-humans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ever closer contact and toward a higher risk of disease transmission&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than protecting the public, the U.S. government remains focused on bolstering corporations and lowering egg prices, which, according to a recent report, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/04/egg-prices-bird-flu-corporate-profits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;have likely been artificially inflated&lt;/a&gt; by agribusiness titans taking advantage of consumers. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;As the USDA bails out animal agriculture and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suggests that the nation &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;allow bird flu to spread through its poultry industry&lt;/a&gt;, it is critical that a country in which &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;99 percent of all farmed animals are kept on factory farms&lt;/a&gt; begin taking this escalating threat seriously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/submitting-opinion-content/"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?w=600" alt="" class="wp-image-4329764" srcset="https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=600,121 600w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=300,61 300w, https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/op2.png?resize=50,10 50w" sizes="(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 600px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;To protect the health of animals and humans, the Trump administration should quickly shift support away from factory farming in favor of a safer and more sustainable plant-based food system. Otherwise, we could be reflecting on an even deadlier pandemic five years from now.  &lt;/p&gt;
