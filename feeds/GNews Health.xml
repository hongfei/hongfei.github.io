&lt;p&gt;Proper hydration is crucial — but what if your glass of water could do more than quench your thirst?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a turbocharged drink gaining popularity in the US that proponents say can boost your energy, fight signs of aging and even ward off signs of disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is going to change the world,” &lt;a href="https://www.perriconemd.com/?affil=awin&amp;amp;utm_content=Skimlinks&amp;amp;utm_term=Sub+Networks&amp;amp;utm_source=AWin_78888&amp;amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_campaign=AffiliateWin&amp;amp;sv_campaign_id=78888&amp;amp;sv_tax1=affiliate&amp;amp;sv_tax2=&amp;amp;sv_tax3=Skimlinks&amp;amp;sv_tax4=nypost.com&amp;amp;sv_affiliate_id=78888&amp;amp;awc=21122_1745425645_74398e18cd85fc36a8be2ba7660ec167" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Nicholas Perricone&lt;/a&gt;, a renowned nutritionist and dermatologist, told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Perricone’s second book “The Beauty Molecule” was released April 15. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images for the New You Awards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his new book, “&lt;a href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBeauty-Molecule-Introducing-Neuroceuticals-Breakthrough%2Fdp%2F1250286794%3Ftag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2025%2F04%2F15%2Fhealth%2Fboost-production-of-the-beauty-molecule-with-this-diet%2F%26asc_source%3Dwww.google.com%26ascsubtag%3Dsrctok-a9337dbc51f28ec9%26btn_ref%3Dsrctok-a9337dbc51f28ec9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The Beauty Molecule: Introducing Neuroceuticals, the Breakthrough for Ageless Beauty&lt;/a&gt;,” Perricone breaks down the science behind the beverage and shares insider tips to maximize every sip.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Looking East for the “magic bullet”&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, Perricone set out on a mission to find what he called the “magic bullet” — an anti-inflammatory that’s nontoxic, affordable, easy to use and widely accessible.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;In Asia, inhaling hydrogen gas for better health and vitality had long been a common practice. But when research out of Japan showed that drinking hydrogen-infused water can boost energy, Perricone’s curiosity was piqued — though he remained skeptical.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hydrogen is a nonpolar molecule. It’s not going to interact with the body,” Perricone remembers thinking at the time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To get to the bottom of it, Perricone traveled to Tokyo to meet with scientists studying hydrogen. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They explained that, when applied to living cells, hydrogen has a potent antioxidant and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/01/health/blueberries-walnuts-dark-chocolate-reduce-joint-inflammation-doctor/"&gt;anti-inflammatory &lt;/a&gt;effect. It also boosts cellular energy while targeting and neutralizing dangerous free radicals in the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Perricone recommends drinking two cans of hydrogen water per day.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;izzetugutmen – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The toxic hydroxyl radical causes significant damage to cell structures and contributes to their functional decline; in other words, aging,” Perricone wrote in his new book.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back in the US, Perricone, with the help of colleague Dr. Peter Pugliese, began testing the effects of hydrogen water on energy. Their focus was on &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/03/lifestyle/nad-supplement-craze-sweeps-hollywood-but-does-it-work/"&gt;NAD+&lt;/a&gt; and NADH, two forms of the same molecule that plays a key role in cellular energy as well as the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;It’s the one of the only molecules in the skin that fluoresces, meaning it emits light or radiation when exposed to certain conditions, such as an LED light.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test whether hydrogen water could boost NADH, Perricone and his team conducted a study in which half the participants drank hydrogen water and the other half had a placebo. Afterward, they were placed under an LED light to track changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perricone expected it to take hours to see any results, but within just two minutes, the first participants’ NADH levels spiked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I sure as hell knew it wasn’t just water,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By the end of the study, participants had a 12.5% average increase in NADH, with the elevated levels lasting for hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This study proved to me that hydrogen can and does increase cellular energy,” Perricone wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can get this country drinking hydrogen water on a regular basis, we could lower our health care costs by a third.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Dr. Nicholas Perricone&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A multimillion-dollar bet&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past eight years, Perricone has poured millions into developing his own hydrogen water — using the same technology and methods already popular in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s the magic bullet I was looking for,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not only is hydrogen water simple, inexpensive and nontoxic, but Perricone said it can help normalize metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As we age, one of the biggest killers is the loss of metabolic control, which is seen in an increase in blood sugar, despite an increase in insulin,” Perricone wrote. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Hydrogen has been shown to help normalize metabolism.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;olga – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This condition, called &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/30/health/metabolic-syndrome-patients-may-benefit-from-intermittent-fasting-study/"&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, causes &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/14/health/this-105-calorie-snack-can-help-lower-your-blood-pressure/"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, elevated blood sugar levels, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/27/health/study-reveals-surprising-brain-boosting-benefit-of-belly-fat/"&gt;belly fat&lt;/a&gt; and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels. It’s linked to a higher risk of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/20/health/exercising-during-this-3-hour-window-lowers-heart-disease-risk/"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/25/health/avoiding-bright-light-at-night-may-prevent-type-2-diabetes-study/"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/26/health/strokes-may-be-more-devastating-to-smart-people-heres-how/"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/17/health/study-digital-tech-use-lowers-risk-of-brain-decline-by-42/"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Perricone believes that hydrogen water could be key in reversing the rise of metabolic syndrome across the country. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He pointed to a study by &lt;a href="https://molecularhydrogeninstitute.org/tyler-lebaron-phd/"&gt;Dr. Tyler LeBaron&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the Molecular Hydrogen Institute, which followed 60 people in India diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. Half drank hydrogen water, while the other half drank plain water — with no changes to diet or exercise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After 24 weeks, the results were staggering. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“One hundred percent of those drinking hydrogen water no longer had metabolic syndrome, and they also lost an average of seven pounds,” Perricone said, noting that the placebo group showed no improvements. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we can get this country drinking hydrogen water on a regular basis, we could lower our health care costs by a third,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his book, Perricone lists several other benefits associated with hydrogen water, including reducing skin aging, boosting gut health, enhancing nutrient absorption, removing toxins, speeding recovery from workouts and improving muscle tone and joint mobility. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He even says it can combat the toxic effects of alcohol, alleviating &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/31/health/dietitian-reveals-4-best-foods-for-hangovers-and-4-to-avoid/"&gt;hangovers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/16/health/how-to-sleep-better-while-traveling-from-jet-lag-hacks-to-amenities/"&gt;fight jet lag&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Maximizing the benefits of hydrogen water &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several brans sell hydrogen water, while Perricone has &lt;a href="https://perriconehydrogenwater.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;launched his own line&lt;/a&gt;, priced at $69.00 for a 24-pack of 12 oz cans. It’s proven a quick hit and has already sold out — though they promise to restock soon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Perricone has spent eight years developing his own brand of hydrogen water.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Perricone Hydrogen Water Company&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But before you crack open a cold can, there are a few things you should know.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You have to drink it out of the can; you can’t pour it into a glass or sip it through a straw because you’ll lose the hydrogen,” Perricone said. “You also have to drink it within 10 minutes of opening.” &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Perricone recommends drinking hydrogen water twice a day, the same as the participants in the metabolic syndrome study. But he drinks more himself — typically three to four cans per day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It gets rid of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/31/surprising-ways-you-can-blitz-brain-fog-and-sharpen-your-mind/"&gt;brain fog&lt;/a&gt; in the morning very quickly,” he said. “I like to have it midday before a workout and toward the end of the day because I often have a lot of work to do and want to have a nice clear brain.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perricone also believes hydrogen water can be especially helpful for people who play sports, particularly children and teens. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If there’s a quick movement of the head, like in soccer, for example, micro-inflammation is created every time they work out,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I would love to see everybody who works out like this or plays sports to have a can of hydrogen water before or after to stop this low-grade inflammation, because it’s cumulative and can damage the body over time. We want this to start in kindergarten.” &lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that psychedelics like MDMA and psilocybin disrupt this immune-brain crosstalk, reducing stress-related fear in mice and showing similar effects in human tissue samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest psychedelics may help reset dysfunctional neuroimmune pathways involved in depression, anxiety, and inflammatory diseases. While not a cure-all, this research opens new therapeutic possibilities for targeting the root of emotional and immune dysregulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear-Inflammation Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Stress triggers immune cells to migrate to the brain and activate fear pathways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychedelic Protection:&lt;/strong&gt; MDMA and psilocybin blocked immune-driven fear responses in preclinical models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Similar immune-brain signaling was found in human tissues and depression datasets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Brigham and Women’s Hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mass General Brigham researchers found that interactions between immune and brain cells drive fear responses, but treatment with psychedelics like MDMA and psilocybin may reverse these effects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that fear and the immune system are connected in previously unknown ways. Researchers at Mass General Brigham found that the immune system can influence stress and fear behaviors by changing how brain cells communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109025"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two brains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelics-fear-neuroinflammation-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Prior research has shown immune signaling can drive the development of neuropsychiatric diseases such as major depressive disorder (MDD). Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators further showed that psychedelic treatments could target these neuroimmune interactions and reduce stress-induced fear in preclinical models and found similar results in human tissue samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results are published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study underscores how psychedelics can do more than just change perception; they can help dial down inflammation and reset brain-immune interactions,” said corresponding author Michael Wheeler, PhD, of the Gene Lay Institute of Immunology and Inflammation as well as the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could reshape how we think about treatment for inflammatory disorders and conditions like anxiety and depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior research has shown immune signaling can drive the development of neuropsychiatric diseases such as major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the ways that specific immune mechanisms can also affect behaviors due to chronic stress or MDD remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a mouse model of chronic stress, the researchers determined that increased crosstalk between cells in the amygdala, or the brain’s fear center, boosted fear behaviors, elevated inflammatory signaling, and activated fear-promoting amygdala neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, inflammatory immune cells called monocytes migrated from other parts of the body to the brain meninges during chronic stress. The research team demonstrated that artificially manipulating these cells impacted fear behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating stressed mice with psilocybin and MDMA prevented monocytes from accumulating in the brain and lowered fear behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators found similar signals of response to stress in human brain cells and in gene expression datasets from patients with MDD, suggesting that the same interactions between the immune system and the brain may play a role in neuropsychiatric disorders in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note that further experiments are needed to understand exactly how psychedelics affect immune cells and brain communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next steps include examining the long-term effects of psychedelic treatment on patients with MDD or inflammatory diseases. Wheeler is currently collaborating with investigators from the Massachusetts General Hospital Center for the Neuroscience of Psychedelics on a clinical trial of patients with depression who are being treated with psychedelics and will examine their tissue samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not saying that psychedelics are a cure-all for inflammatory diseases or any other health condition,” said Wheeler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But we do see evidence that psychedelics have some tissue-specific benefits and that learning more about them could open up entirely new possibilities for treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorship: &lt;/strong&gt;In addition to Wheeler, Mass General Brigham authors include Elizabeth N.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LUCAS, Texas — A Collin County middle schooler tested positive for &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas-updates-numbers-cases-dfw-dallas-everything-need-know/287-b3720460-9d97-4d3c-b646-f056c40a3807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;, the first known case in a child in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, Collin County Health Care Services confirmed Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials confirmed one case of measles involving a student who attends Willow Springs Middle School in Lucas, part of Lovejoy Independent School District. According to data from Texas Health and Human Services, 95% of seventh graders in Lovejoy ISD received an MMR vaccine in the 2023-2024 school year. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unclear if the student was vaccinated. Due to the patient's age, no additional information will be released, health officials said. It's also unclear if the case is linked to the warning Collin County health officials &lt;a href="/article/news/local/measles-plano-texas-stores-collin-county-walmart-exposure-cases/287-94b26b10-e7c7-439b-b08c-3cee0d8ac1f4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;previously &lt;/a&gt;issued on April 18 about a person who tested positive for &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas-updates-numbers-cases-dfw-dallas-everything-need-know/287-b3720460-9d97-4d3c-b646-f056c40a3807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; and visited three stores, including a Walmart, in Plano while still infectious.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case announced Tuesday was the first known case of a child contracting the disease in the Metroplex.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two cases previously reported in Rockwall County both involved adults, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four cases of measles, including at least one child, were announced in March by the Paris-Lamar County Health District, which is located northeast of DFW.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services reported 624 cases of measles in the state of Texas on Wednesday morning. The number of cases, mostly from the January West Texas outbreak, increased by 27, the state department said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main measles outbreak has been in the South Plains region of West Texas. Most of the cases have been among unvaccinated children. Two children in Lubbock &lt;a href="/article/news/health/texas-measles-death-outbreak-lubbock/285-636380ac-1d18-4404-999d-b804f40137af" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;have died from the virus&lt;/a&gt;, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is infectious for four days before and four days after a rash appears, the release states. Measles spreads through infectious droplets and the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/vaccine-preventable-diseases/vaccine-preventable-disease-conditions/measles-rubeola" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt;. It’s important to note that the measles virus can remain infectious in the air up to two hours after an infected person leaves.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span class="tag-term"&gt;News Release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2025-04-23T11:00:00-04:00" class="date-display-single"&gt;Wednesday, April 23, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;NIH study reveals how inflammation makes touch painful&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;
Researchers uncover the cellular and molecular basis for sensing heat and inflammatory pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have discovered clues as to how our bodies turn sensations such as heat and touch into signals sent to the brain — and how these signals can be altered by inflammation to drive pain. The research focuses on the nerve cells in the skin that help us detect the location, intensity, and emotional quality of touch, known as somatosensory neurons. By combining advanced imaging techniques with detailed molecular analysis, the researchers explored how heat and touch activate different types of receptor cells in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To develop better treatments for pain, it’s critical that we deepen our understanding of the biology behind how sensory signals are received, transmitted, and ultimately perceived by the brain,” said Alex Chesler, Ph.D., co-author of the study and senior investigator at NIH. “Over the past few years, we developed a platform for watching sensation in action, revealing new details about the cells and molecules required and, in this study, how inflammation triggers pain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research revealed how different types of cells were “called into action” depending on whether the stimulus was innocuous, such as gentle warmth or touch, or noxious, meaning a stimulus strong enough to potentially cause damage to normal tissue. For example, heat and gentle touch were transmitted by entirely different types of cells. When the stimulus was more intense, the nerve cells began to overlap in their roles for transmitting the sensations of heat and pressure, providing an explanation for how cells detect and distinguish between innocuous and noxious stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is well known to be linked to pain, but the understanding of what is happening on the cellular and molecular levels is less clear. In their experiments, researchers injected prostaglandin E2 into the skin, a molecule that causes inflammation and drives pain. With the inflammatory response set into motion, researchers found that certain neurons used for signaling pain (nociceptors) became active and sensitized to heat for a long duration, demonstrating the cellular processes at play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This explains how inflammation drives ongoing pain and why heat becomes more painful,” said Nick Ryba, Ph.D., co-author and senior investigator at NIH. “However, what was unexpected was that touch detection remained unchanged.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study found that inflammation-related hypersensitivity to touch, known as tactile allodynia, was caused by the ongoing nociceptor activity induced by inflammation superimposed on the normal sensation of touch. This finding is consistent with previous research at NIH showing that the ion channel &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/news/press-releases/study-identifies-gene-that-makes-gentle-touch-feel-painful-after-injury"&gt;PIEZO2 plays a crucial role in this type of pain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research is part of a long-term collaboration between the groups headed by Drs. Chesler and Ryba. Together these labs conduct basic research focusing on how sensory input is detected and processed by the brain to evoke specific behaviors. According to Dr. Chesler, even though this study is in mice, the similarities to humans in the neural pathways far outweigh the differences, so the findings hold important implications for people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By learning more about how touch and heat are signaled in the body, we’re identifying new clues for treating pain,” said Dr. Chesler. “Our study shows how different types of pain may benefit from different types of treatments. In short, by identifying exactly which cells and molecules ‘turn up the volume’ of different types of pain, we may be able to identify the ‘switches’ that can turn the volume down.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was led by investigators in the Sensory Cells and Circuits Lab at NIH’s National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health and the Taste and Smell Section at NIH’s National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research.&lt;/p&gt;

Coli is undercooked ground beef, where bacteria can spread during processing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But leafy greens like romaine and spinach are another major culprit, often contaminated in the field through tainted water or contact with livestock.&lt;/p&gt;

Coli can also sneak in through contaminated water, which may be used to irrigate crops or clean equipment, and poor kitchen hygiene can help it spread to other foods like poultry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ludmil Alexandrov, senior study author and professor of cellular and molecular medicine at the University of California San Diego, said: 'These mutation patterns are a kind of historical record in the genome, and they point to early-life exposure to colibactin as a driving force behind early-onset disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This reshapes how we think about cancer. It might not be just about what happens in adulthood—cancer could potentially be influenced by events in early life, perhaps even the first few years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sustained investment in this type of research will be critical in the global effort to prevent and treat cancer before it’s too late.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of under-50s being diagnosed with bowel cancer is increasing worldwide, according to a major global study published last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An increase in rates was reported in 27 of the 50 countries examined by US researchers, with the greatest annual increases seen in New Zealand (4 percent), Chile (4 percent) and England (3.6 percent). &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the latest data, early-onset colon cancer diagnoses in the US are expected to rise by 90 percent in people 20 to 34 years old between 2010 and 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In teens, rates have surged 500 percent since the early 2000s.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates 154,270 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year, and 52,900 will die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, 44,063 cases are diagnosed per year, and the nation sees 16,808 deaths every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest study, published Wednesday in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09025-8"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;, looked at the DNA of 981 colon cancer tumors in patients who were either under 40 or over 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients were spread across 11 countries, including the US and UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Evan White lost his four-year battle with colon cancer at age 29&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Carly Barrett, from Kentucky, was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 24 after detecting blood in her stool and suffering from abdominal pain. She is still battling the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found colibactin leaves behind specific patterns of DNA mutations that were 3.3 times more common in early-onset cases than in those diagnosed after the age of 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These mutations were also most common in countries with high rates of early-onset colon cancer, such as the US and UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While earlier research has linked colibactin-related mutations to around 10 to 15 percent of all colorectal cancer cases, those studies mostly looked at older patients or didn’t separate early-onset from late-onset disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This new study is the first to show that these cancer-driving mutations are significantly more common in younger patients, suggesting a unique link between childhood exposure and early-onset colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marcos Diaz-Gay, first study author and former postdoctoral researcher in Alexandrov's lab, said: 'When we started this project, we weren’t planning to focus on early-onset colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our original goal was to examine global patterns of colorectal cancer to understand why some countries have much higher rates than others. But as we dug into the data, one of the most interesting and striking findings was how frequently colibactin-related mutations appeared in the early-onset cases.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the increase in US colorectal cancers in men and women from 2000 through 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;E coli bacteria sickens 265,000 Americans, with young children being the most at risk. Children may catch it at petting zoos or by eating contaminated foods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also found colibactin-related mutations start early in colon tumor development, with is consistent with previous research suggesting these mutations occur in the first 10 years of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found colibactin-related mutations account for 15 percent of APC driver mutations, which are some of the earliest genetic alterations directly linked to cancer, in colon cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alexandrov said: 'If someone acquires one of these driver mutations by the time they're 10 years old, they could be decades ahead of schedule for developing colorectal cancer, getting it at age 40 instead of 60.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most strands of E. coli are harmless, though six strains produce toxins like colibactin. Toxin-producing strains include siga toxin-producing (STEC), enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC), enteroinvasive (EIEC), enteroaggregative (EAEC) and diffusely adherent (DAEC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toxin-producing E. coli can cause bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps, vomiting and fever. In severe cases, it can lead to dehydration and hemolytic uremic syndrome, a kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also found despite the notable rises in the US and UK, the researchers found colon cancers in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Russia and Thailand were had the largest increases in colibactin-related mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diaz-Gay said: 'It’s possible that different countries have different unknown causes. That could open up the potential for targeted, region-specific prevention strategies.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers plan to investigate how children are being exposed to colibactin-producing bacteria and if medications like probiotics can eliminate harmful strains of bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also plans to look into how environmental exposures later in life can increase the risk of colon cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alexandrov said: 'Not every environmental factor or behavior we study leaves a mark on our genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But we’ve found that colibactin is one of those that can. In this case, its genetic imprint appears to be strongly associated with colorectal cancers in young adults.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Gold dust in eyes might seem like an unusual therapy – but a new mouse study in the US shows the approach could potentially treat age-related&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration"&gt; macular degeneration&lt;/a&gt; (AMD) and other eye problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macular degeneration affects millions worldwide and becomes more likely as we age. Damage to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macula"&gt;macula&lt;/a&gt;, located in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina"&gt;retina&lt;/a&gt; and containing light-sensitive &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell"&gt;photoreceptor cell&lt;/a&gt;s, causes blurring and other vision issues. While there are treatments available to slow the progression of AMD, they don't reverse it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a new type of retinal prosthesis that has the potential to restore vision lost to retinal degeneration without requiring any kind of complicated surgery or genetic modification," &lt;a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2025-04-16/goldeneyes"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biomedical engineer Jiarui Nie, from Brown University in Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We believe this technique could potentially transform treatment paradigms for retinal degenerative conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_158745" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158745" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/StudyDesign.jpg" alt="Study design" class="wp-image-158745 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/StudyDesign.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/StudyDesign-600x369.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-158745" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The study combined gold nanoparticles with infrared light. (Nie et al., &lt;em&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's how the new treatment works: very fine gold nanoparticles, thousands of times thinner than a human hair, are laced &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody"&gt;with antibodies&lt;/a&gt; to target specific eye cells. They're then injected into the gel-filled vitreous chamber between the retina and the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, a small infrared laser device is used to excite these nanoparticles and activate specific cells in the same way photoreceptors do. If the treatment makes it to us humans as well, that laser could be embedded in a pair of glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mice this was tested on, engineered to have retinal disorders, the treatment method was effective at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-first-stem-cell-transplant-restores-vision-in-multiple-people"&gt;restoring vision&lt;/a&gt;, at least partly (it's tricky to give a mouse a full eye test). It showed the nanoparticles could help bypass damaged photoreceptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_158746" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158746" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/EyeImprovements.jpg" alt="Eye improvements" class="wp-image-158746 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/EyeImprovements.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/EyeImprovements-600x246.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-158746" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Improvements in vision were seen in the study mice. (Nie et al., &lt;em&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We showed that the nanoparticles can stay in the retina for months with no major toxicity," &lt;a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2025-04-16/goldeneyes"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Nie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And we showed that they can successfully stimulate the visual system. That's very encouraging for future applications."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach has similarities to existing treatments &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/results-of-3-year-clinical-trial-show-the-bionic-eye-safely-restores-vision"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for AMD and related conditions such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/results-of-3-year-clinical-trial-show-the-bionic-eye-safely-restores-vision"&gt;retinitis pigmentosa&lt;/a&gt;. However, this new method is less invasive, with no surgery or large implants inside the eye needed, and also promises to cover a wider field of vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most studies in mice, there's a good chance the findings will translate over to humans, but it'll take a while to get there – and to get something safe that can be approved for use. This is an important first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of studies are presenting ways in which eye diseases could be tackled by the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lab-grown-retinas-to-restore-vision-are-a-step-closer-to-human-trials"&gt;latest technology&lt;/a&gt; and science, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-new-way-to-activate-dormant-cells-in-the-retina-could-restore-vision"&gt;reprogramming other retinal cells&lt;/a&gt; to replace photoreceptors that are no longer working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This innovation marks a significant breakthrough, setting the stage for future development of photothermal retinal prostheses such as wearable goggles," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.4c14061"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For future human applications, further refinement is necessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.4c14061"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

'We drive there the afternoon before infusions, then we have a full infusion day from 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and then we drive home. We couldn't be happier with the team of physicians and nurses that care for her.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Begbie family has started a foundation called the Rowan Tree Foundation of East Tennessee to help raise money to find a treatment for Sanfilippo and help other families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's overwhelming, we've seen friends and people from every corner of our lives show up for us over the last year and it's been absolutely amazing,' her parents said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We have super generous and talented people that surround us and love us that helped us put today together.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sanfilippo affects just 5,000 Americans and causes dementia-like symptoms in children, including the inability to speak, walk, eat on their own or remember any of the skills they've learned throughout their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It impacts about one in 70,000 births every year and develops when each parent passes on a faulty gene.

Across the globe, MPS IIIA is the most common and makes up more than half of the cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also considered the most severe, causing symptoms and death at earlier ages, according to the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no approved cure for the disease but the Sanfilippo Foundation said research and clinical trials for enzyme replacements are working toward treatments that could potentially slow the progression of the disease and extend a patient's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have pinpointed the 'magic number' of weekly intimate encounters needed to ward off depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There's no need for sex marathons — just once a week is enough to boost mental health, the researchers found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts from the Shantou University Medical College found that those who have sex at least once a week have significantly lower odds of depression, compared to those who do so less than once a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the study, which involved 14,741 US adults, revealed that weekly intimacy could reduce the risk of developing symptoms of the mood disorder by 24 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This effect was most prominent among younger adults, aged 20 to 30, who saw greater protection from depressive feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists theorised that the effect may lie with the release of the 'feel good' hormones such as endorphins and dopamine that happens during sex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These chemicals surge by 200 per cent during intimate acts, and are known to help with pain and stress relief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Regardless of sexual orientation, sexual activity offers benefits such as enhanced wellbeing and quality of life, significantly impacting mental health', co-author professor Mutong Chen said of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;People who have less sex may be putting their health in jeopardy, a group of scientists have claimed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-473b3df0-2051-11f0-87ee-e31941004579" class=""&gt;Depression&lt;/a&gt; affects around 280million people globally. Yet, available treatments, such as talking therapy and antidepressant drugs, are only effective in around half of cases, some studies show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, researchers recruited participants aged 20 to 59, and asked them to complete a survey about their sex lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were also tasked with completing a survey commonly used to diagnose depression, called the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results revealed that while around 7.5 per cent of participants had moderate to severe depression, having sex more than once a month significantly reduced the odds of experiencing symptoms of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who reported having weekly sex saw the biggest benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst researchers found that increasing sexual frequency had a positive effect on psychological well-being, additional protection against depression &lt;span&gt;appeared to peak at around 103 times per year — which is approximately twice a week. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers hope the findings will help to shed new light on the emotional benefits of sex and help highlight the need to explore alternative treatments for managing depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

These senescent cells accumulate with age or injury and cause inflammation, pain, and tissue damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When administered orally to mice, the drugs reduced inflammation, relieved pain, and even reversed disc damage, with the greatest benefits seen when both drugs were combined. This groundbreaking approach could transform treatment for millions with chronic back pain by targeting the source, not just the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Root Cause Targeted:&lt;/strong&gt; Zombie-like senescent cells drive inflammation in spinal discs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Drug Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; o-Vanillin and RG-7112 worked best when used together.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oral Success:&lt;/strong&gt; Drugs delivered by mouth reached hard-to-access spinal discs and reversed damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;McGill University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a preclinical study led by McGill University researchers, two drugs targeting “zombie cells” have been shown to treat the underlying cause of chronic low back pain. The condition affects millions of people worldwide.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current treatments manage symptoms through painkillers or surgery, without addressing the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109017"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a spine." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/zombie-cells-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results offer some of the first evidence that o-Vanillin can clear out zombie cells. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings are exciting because it suggests we might be able to treat back pain in a completely new way, by removing the cells driving the problem, not just masking the pain,” said senior author Lisbet Haglund, a Professor in McGill’s Department of Surgery and Co-director of the Orthopaedic Research Laboratory at the Montreal General Hospital (MUHC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was conducted by McGill’s Alan Edwards Centre for Research on Pain at the Montreal General Hospital, part of the MUHC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treating pain at the source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senescent cells, often called zombie cells, build up in the spinal discs as people age or when discs are damaged. Instead of dying off like normal cells, these aging cells linger and cause inflammation, pain and damage to the spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore a potential solution, the research team administered two drugs orally to mice: o-Vanillin, a natural compound, and RG-7112, an FDA-approved cancer drug. They were administered together as well as separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found the drugs could clear zombie cells from the spine, reduce pain and inflammation, and slow or even reverse damage to spinal discs after eight weeks of treatment. Each of the drugs had a beneficial effect, but the impact was greatest when they were administered together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised that an oral treatment could reach the spinal discs, which are hard to access and present a major hurdle in treating back pain,” said Haglund. “The big question now is whether these drugs can have the same effect in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A natural compound’s surprising potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, o-Vanillin wasn’t originally intended to be part of the study and was included almost by chance. Haglund explained that while testing other drugs, her team decided to add the compound, derived from turmeric and known for its anti-inflammatory properties, to see whether it might be effective in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results offer some of the first evidence that o-Vanillin can clear out zombie cells. Analogs of RG-7112 are known to do this in osteoarthritis and cancer research, but had not been used to treat back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Haglund’s team will work to improve o-Vanillin’s structure to help it stay in the body longer to become even more effective. They believe these drugs have the potential to treat other age-related diseases driven by senescent cells, such as arthritis or osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Senolytic Treatment for Low Back Pain” by Matthew Mannarino, Hosni Cherif and Lisbet Haglund et al., was published in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, The Arthritis Society, Le Réseau de Recherche en Santé Buccodentaire et Osseuse and the Louise and Alan Edwards Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this pain research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fb909e92979ad59f9e8b9a8b9ebb96989c929797d5989a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Keila DePape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mcgill.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Keila DePape – McGill University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adr1719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Senolytic treatment for low back pain&lt;/a&gt;” by Lisbet Haglund et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Senolytic treatment for low back pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senescent cells (SnCs) accumulate because of aging and external cellular stress throughout the body. They adopt a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and release inflammatory and degenerative factors that actively contribute to age-related diseases, such as low back pain (LBP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senolytics, &lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt;-vanillin and RG-7112, remove SnCs in human intervertebral discs (IVDs) and reduce SASP release, but it is unknown whether they can treat LBP. &lt;em&gt;sparc&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, with LBP, were treated orally with &lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt;-vanillin and RG-7112 as single or combination treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment reduced LBP and SASP factor release and removed SnCs from the IVD and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment also lowered degeneration scores in the IVDs, improved vertebral bone quality, and reduced the expression of pain markers in the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, our data suggest RG-7112 and &lt;em&gt;o&lt;/em&gt;-vanillin as potential disease-modifying drugs for LBP and other painful disorders linked to cell senescence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 14:37:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTFBBb3lBckpqc3Q5NDFFcGNFUGQwbXRVWWhwZlhNR3dSekZGUkNfODc0cnVQQ2ljaUoyNE53T2JiTXNlUWxpdlJGSS1xZXhMY2hSbk1MNGY4aURSZk0zN2s4SWNTcw</guid></item><item><title>步行真的能帮助你活得更久吗？本研究建议“是” -超过十年- AOL.com | Can Walking Really Help You Live Longer?

By comparing the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64364908/muscle-activation-technique/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:most active;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;most active&lt;/a&gt; participants to those with the least amount of physical activity, scientists found that &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64538249/walking-aging-longevity-11-minutes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:life expectancy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; was positively correlated with exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the least active 25 percent of Americans matched the top quarter, they would need to add about 111 minutes of daily walking (or an equivalent activity) to their routine. But the rewards were significant: It could, in theory, increase their lifespans by up to 11 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perks weren't as big for already-active participants, but still notable: Those in the second-lowest activity group who walked about 83 extra minutes a day could add 4.6 years to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can walking add 11 years to my life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's tough to say—this is just one study and it only tracked the activity of people over four days. Also, there are a lot of factors that go into how long you live, making it difficult to pin it all on one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, there does seem to be a connection between moving more and longevity.

Both male and female mice benefited, and the study’s advanced testing system may accelerate future research into targeted psychedelic therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Lasting Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; One dose of 25CN-NBOH improved learning adaptability for 15–20 days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Flexibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice showed enhanced performance on reversal learning tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Effects were observed in both sexes, with implications for treating cognitive disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Genomic Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a groundbreaking research study, University of Michigan researchers have discovered that a single dose of a psychedelic compound can enhance cognitive flexibility—the brain’s ability to adapt to changing circumstances—for weeks after administration, potentially revolutionizing treatments for depression, PTSD, and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Psychedelics&lt;/em&gt;, demonstrates that mice treated with a single dose of 25CN-NBOH, a selective serotonin 2A receptor agonist, showed markedly improved performance in reversal learning tasks compared to control groups when tested 2-3 weeks after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109013"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person and swirly lines." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychedelic-neuroplasticity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Importantly, the study found that both male and female mice showed significant improvements in cognitive flexibility, suggesting the potential broad applicability of psychedelic therapy across biological sexes. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What makes this discovery particularly significant is the sustained duration of cognitive benefits following just one psychedelic dose,” explains Professor Omar J. Ahmed, the study’s senior, corresponding author from the University of Michigan’s Department of Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We observed enhanced learning adaptability that persisted for weeks, suggesting these compounds may induce lasting and behaviorally meaningful neuroplasticity changes in the prefrontal cortex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an innovative automated sequential learning paradigm, researchers measured how effectively mice could adapt to rule reversals—a standard test for cognitive flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The psychedelic-treated mice demonstrated superior adaptability compared to saline controls, with enhanced task efficiency, higher percentages of correct trials, and increased reward acquisition during the reversal phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Brain Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results complement existing cellular research showing psychedelic-induced structural remodeling in the prefrontal cortex but uniquely demonstrate sustained cognitive benefits persisting long after the immediate effects of the drug have dissipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As interest in psychedelic medicine continues to grow, this research raises intriguing questions about how psychedelics might reshape neural pathways governing flexible thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could these compounds potentially reopen critical periods of brain plasticity? What molecular mechanisms underlie these long-lasting cognitive improvements? How might the timing and frequency of administration affect long-term neuroplasticity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The current study focused on the long-term effects of a single psychedelic dose. A key question is what happens with two, three, or even twenty doses taken over several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Is every additional dose increasingly beneficial for flexible learning or is there a plateau effect or even a negative effect of too many doses? These are important questions to answer next in the quest to make psychedelic medicine more rational and mechanistic,” according to Dr. Ahmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex Differences and Clinical Potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the study found that both male and female mice showed significant improvements in cognitive flexibility, suggesting the potential broad applicability of psychedelic therapy across biological sexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most striking aspect of our findings is that these cognitive benefits were measured 15-20 days after a single psychedelic administration,” notes Elizabeth J. Brouns, first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that a single dose of a psychedelic isn’t just temporarily altering perception, but potentially inducing lasting beneficial changes in brain function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodological Advances&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s automated behavioral task represents a significant methodological advance for evaluating flexible learning, enabling researchers to efficiently evaluate cognitive flexibility in future investigations of psychedelic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This high-throughput approach could accelerate the development of targeted psychedelic therapies for specific cognitive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and neuroplasticity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d1bcb0bdb8ffa6bebfb691b6b4bfbebcb8b2a1a3b4a2a2ffb2bebc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ma-Li Wong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://genomicpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Genomic Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Ma-Li Wong – Genomic Press&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.61373/pp025r.0002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Single-dose psychedelic enhances cognitive flexibility and reversal learning in mice weeks after administration&lt;/a&gt;” by Omar J.

            The United States has seen progress in reducing certain cancer risks, as overall smoking rates remain on a decline. But for other risk factors, such as those tied to cervical cancer, there is room for improvement, according to a new American Cancer Society report.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The prevalence of people smoking fell from about 14% in 2019 to 11% in 2023, according to the report published Wednesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC-2B4M3whl4oys2dRqXQUpBS-2BtME2cdcP5-2Fzwyk4wkYUBo8m49mUeO92iYSkvLQAJINQ-3D-3D7--Y_-2BfvDFm8rLlMG3DiFVwLpkkmQZ5tK1QI-2Bs-2FpJe6gRjYIK1XFj6zR1wY-2F1FgAYynw6K4-2Bl7TMadhQ9W-2Bo9QZg2Rj7MXKRbkCN5xWuHUBqrIVNI2alfkNwo317m3FEpNGnhzpUOaRIQ59tQUesFqbY1D-2BJRj2bxu9B9-2F3QX8fO5cS1-2Bpad0GUhRk77nEthdHu6VzRdF46PjrvFK3BctkuEjBV6kP-2FoYdSF1TZRQqEFWBbauRqoGvIVJqndsjt61k-2BFvZbK2SUqCBVgDKqiJz5GdzHec5MXgY9MjhdzIZxApYr-2FT3XJWsHwdPIs7lx5xOekByiJD1fL8pD8zo30wytdG6SzuvArKKqm1vO8-2BYjYcUX8-3D" target="_blank"&gt;Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp;amp; Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.

            “These latest findings are encouraging, mainly the reduction in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;smoking rates and screening for certain cancers, but it’s clear urgent efforts are needed to address lagging cervical cancer prevention,” &lt;a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC3HNfgi38fGTAXIc-2FFypHjVBhGPVi-2BkaL7EwbLTO4Y6ebCFJIXAQD1dHT6pr-2F4jw-2FSOeyxwhX9S3KjhfHPBM6dM-3DmFSM_-2BfvDFm8rLlMG3DiFVwLpkkmQZ5tK1QI-2Bs-2FpJe6gRjYIK1XFj6zR1wY-2F1FgAYynw6K4-2Bl7TMadhQ9W-2Bo9QZg2Rj7MXKRbkCN5xWuHUBqrIVNI2alfkNwo317m3FEpNGnhzpUOaRIQ59tQUesFqbY1D-2BJRj2bxu9B9-2F3QX8fO5cS1-2Bpad0GUhRk77nEthdHu6VzRdF46PjrvFK3BctkuEjBW9jaDTcfZcP2MkiZOIIsMQ-2Bl2u74xR8vETSP4gUDkv29IHJ3EZlUIn2id3GsXXmN8Vgc5VG0mgzYTBgezk9ziFq9IWHhW1isSi7ZikIRxWuIyU7HurgR8XxLKertJGACgxlhMC6QbysL0ErkHQbWwA-3D" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Priti Bandi&lt;/a&gt;, scientific director of cancer risk factors and screening surveillance research at the American Cancer Society and lead author of the study, said in a news release.

            The prevalence of people being up-to-date on recommended cervical cancer screenings has dropped from 74.8% in 2019 to 73.4% in 2021 among ages 21 to 65, the report found, leaving more women at risk of not detecting disease early. The reported noted that the decrease is alarming as HPV vaccination rates have remained “statistically unchanged” in recent years. In 2023, 61.4% of adolescents ages 13 to 17 were up-to-date for the HPV vaccination series, similar to 61.7% in 2021 and up from 54.2% in 2019.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            HPV or human papillomavirus is a &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/diseases/hpv/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;group of more than 150 viruses&lt;/a&gt; that can cause certain types of cancer. Spread primarily through sexual contact, most cases of HPV clear on their own within two years, but &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/about/about-genital-hpv-infection.html" target="_blank"&gt;when the infection does not go away&lt;/a&gt;, health problems like cancer may occur – which is why preventing these infections with vaccination has been key.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9txqnrj000a3b6owgzad536@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new report included data on US adults and their modifiable cancer risk factors in the years during and after the Covid-19 pandemic compared with the years prior to the pandemic. The data came from sources at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including the CDC’s National Health Interview Survey, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the National Immunization Survey-Teen.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9txqnrj000b3b6oj7ptf6o7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s estimated that nearly half – about 40% – of new cancer cases among US adults ages 30 and older could be attributed to preventable risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, excess body weight, an unhealthy diet, not exercising regularly, ultraviolet radiation exposure and cancer-causing infections like HPV.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9txqnrj000c3b6o7g02igrw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Despite historic reductions in smoking levels and improvements in breast and colorectal cancer screenings, including following the COVID-19 pandemic, obesity rates remain high and unchanged, physical activity levels remain suboptimal, and HPV vaccination levels have plateaued since 2021,” the American Cancer Society researchers wrote in the new report. They added that racial disparities in cancer rates and deaths persist as marginalized groups face barriers accessing healthcare.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9txqnrj000d3b6o0sth4nk7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Staying up-to-date on cancer screenings can further prevent thousands of additional cancer cases and deaths, according to the American Cancer Society.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9txqnrj000f3b6opjxvfwbl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A separate report released Monday found that the rate of people dying from cancer has stayed on a steady decline in the US from 2001 through 2022. But when it comes to the rate of people being diagnosed with cancer, the incidence rate among men fell from 2001 through 2013 and then stabilized through 2021, while incidence among women increased slightly every year between 2003 and 2021.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Those trends were interrupted in 2020, when cancer incidence rates fell significantly, possibly because of disruptions in cancer screenings and medical care related to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/report_to_nation/" target="_blank"&gt;Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Cancer. After 2020, they returned to expected levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9txqnrj000h3b6olafenb5h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sustained declines in lung cancer have been a major contributor to the overall improvements in cancer death rates in the US. Fewer people in the US are using tobacco, helping lower incidence and death rates for smoking-related cancers like lung, bladder and larynx, the report said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9txqnrj000i3b6okf7j3j5e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, incidence rates are on the rise for several other cancers, including those linked with excess weight, such as pancreas and kidney cancers; uterine, breast and liver cancers among women; and colon and rectal cancers among adolescents and young adults.

In healthy mice, key “hub” molecules like ATP and AMP responded rapidly and in a coordinated sequence to starvation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In obese mice, this temporal coordination was lost, even though the molecular network appeared structurally sound. This breakthrough highlights the importance of timing in metabolic regulation and introduces a new method for analyzing biological networks over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temporal Breakdown:&lt;/strong&gt; Obese mice show disrupted timing, not structure, in liver metabolism during starvation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hub Molecule Shift:&lt;/strong&gt; Healthy livers used ATP/AMP as core regulators; obese livers did not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Method:&lt;/strong&gt; Combines structural and temporal data for deeper insight into metabolism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Tokyo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers led by Keigo Morita and Shinya Kuroda of the University of Tokyo have revealed a temporal disruption in the metabolism of obese mice when adapting to starvation despite no significant structural disruptions in the molecular network. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a breakthrough discovery as research including the temporal dimension in biology has been notoriously laborious and extracting systematic insight from big data has been difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109008"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows the shadow of an obese person and a clock." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/obesity-metabolism-timing-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In other words, even though the structure of the molecular network during starvation remained robust, it became temporally vulnerable to obesity. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, this study paves the way for further research into more general metabolic processes, such as food intake and disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Signaling&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living beings need to continuously extract energy from “food” and distribute it within the body to stay alive, that is keep their metabolisms running so that their bodies are in an optimal range called “homeostatis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starvation is one of the most severe disruptions to this system. When adapting to starvation, the liver, which plays a central role in metabolism, coordinates not just which but also when molecules need to take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Molecules inside cells form a large network,” says Kuroda, the principal investigator, “containing a small number of molecules regulating many metabolic reactions called hub molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, a systematic understanding of the temporal coordination of molecules in the liver had been elusive due to the lack of comprehensive time-series data during starvation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to fill the gap by comparing the livers of healthy and obese mice. Their measures showed a clear difference between the hub molecules of healthy and obese liver cells. The former contained the energy-related molecules ATP and AMP, but the latter did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a clear difference between hub molecules could have structurally disrupted the molecular network. However, the researchers did not find such disruptions, so they investigated the temporal dimension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We comprehensively measured the time courses of various molecules,” says Kuroda, “and found that hub molecules in healthy livers responded to starvation more rapidly than other molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggested a well-controlled temporal order of the molecular networks in healthy livers during starvation. On the other hand, this coordination disappeared in the liver of obese mice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, even though the structure of the molecular network during starvation remained robust, it became temporally vulnerable to obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method that led to this discovery, combining structural and temporal analysis of the intracellular molecular network, can be applied to other studies that include data sets from multiple “omes” such as the genome or the microbiome, opening avenues for further research. Kuroda describes their next project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our approach successfully described the global landscape of adaptation to starvation, a complicated biological phenomenon. We would like to generalize our insights of the metabolic network during starvation to the metabolic network during food intake or disease progression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this metabolism and obesity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6200071016034c070f071107220f030b0e4c174f160d091b0d4c03014c0812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emese Berta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://u-tokyo.ac.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Tokyo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Emese Berta – University of Tokyo&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.ads2547" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Structural robustness and temporal vulnerability of the starvation-responsive metabolic network in healthy and obese mouse liver&lt;/a&gt;” by Keigo Morita et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Signaling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structural robustness and temporal vulnerability of the starvation-responsive metabolic network in healthy and obese mouse liver&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adaptation to starvation is a multimolecular and temporally ordered process. We sought to elucidate how the healthy liver regulates various molecules in a temporally ordered manner during starvation and how obesity disrupts this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used multiomic data collected from the plasma and livers of wild-type and leptin-deficient obese (&lt;em&gt;ob&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;ob&lt;/em&gt;) mice at multiple time points during starvation to construct a starvation-responsive metabolic network that included responsive molecules and their regulatory relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the network structure showed that in wild-type mice, the key molecules for energy homeostasis, ATP and AMP, acted as hub molecules to regulate various metabolic reactions in the network. Although neither ATP nor AMP was responsive to starvation in &lt;em&gt;ob&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;ob&lt;/em&gt; mice, the structural properties of the network were maintained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In wild-type mice, the molecules in the network were temporally ordered through metabolic processes coordinated by hub molecules, including ATP and AMP, and were positively or negatively coregulated. By contrast, both temporal order and coregulation were disrupted in &lt;em&gt;ob&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;ob&lt;/em&gt; mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that the metabolic network that responds to starvation was structurally robust but temporally disrupted by the obesity-associated loss of responsiveness of the hub molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, we propose how obesity alters the response to intermittent fasting.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:43:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBWcV85d185M3BrUlhNUDVTR2dVLTEyMEU0NEliaHJrYzVCUV85VHczbDlOX1BLbDFZYnVPa1FDQXIzdVVNSlp0VkFaSTJWTGVRekl5dGxfeWdHNVFQQXgwVFVUcFpwTklGb0JMRkJn</guid></item><item><title>韦伯望远镜正在取得令人难以置信的发现：它可能会变暗- Phys.org | The Webb Telescope is making incredible discoveries: It may go dark - Phys.org</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPbk5vUmVCanRTX3lCaWo5V2h4bDhiMnpBR19UcWVoU1Fhak1PaWFubEhDNHZyVkFvMllTNFhSMHZNTzU4b1laT1FuUXg4N2hfdDRvTE1mclVHNThhRklTb3ktUEI5TmdyM0tteWktWFVLZGpLYXAtTjUwVjJvODc4UE1TSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The political news these days is enough to make some Chicagoans wish they were a million miles away. But consider this: Even in the depths of space, there's no escape from politics.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;The $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope is literally parked 1 million miles away. In the nearly three years since it became operational, "Webb," as it's called, has made some incredible findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webb uses infrared scanning to show how stars and galaxies form, and to study the atmospheres of distant planets. Its capabilities complement the aging Hubble Space Telescope, which orbits Earth at an altitude of only 340 miles or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other discoveries, Webb has uncovered the slow-motion process of a star engulfing a planet and provided data about an asteroid traveling at high speed in our direction (It will miss us).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think any U.S. president would view this as an asset. Alas, like so much of the country's ongoing scientific research, Webb is at risk of being defunded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump's administration has removed NASA's top scientist and proposed a nearly 50% budget cut to the agency's Science Mission Directorate, which oversees &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/planetary+science/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;planetary science&lt;/a&gt;, astrophysics research and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House reportedly is pushing to scrap the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, a wide-view instrument undergoing final testing and assembly that is scheduled for launch within two years. Next-generation satellites meant to improve human understanding of the planet are on the chopping block as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While NASA's proposed budget retains some funding for the Hubble and Webb telescopes, they could become practically useless given the cuts planned for the agency's science staff.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Pointing these gadgets at the right targets to obtain useful data is no simple feat. Without a critical mass of scientists, "the science from these instruments stops," Daniel Holz, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago, told us. "It's just not viable if these cuts go through anywhere near what's proposed. There is no bare-bones mode to run these highly complex, state-of-the-art facilities."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration's planned cuts at NASA are being repeated at other agencies employing scientists to do everything from vetting new prescription drugs to predicting hurricane landfalls. Similarly, Trump's pressure campaign on elite universities uses federal research funding as leverage, in some cases threatening to destroy years of work by disrupting long-term studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this page supports fiscal responsibility and eliminating wasteful spending, the latest moves have an ulterior motive. They are aimed at gaining control over institutions likely to push back against Trump's agenda by citing inconvenient truths: Climate change is no hoax, vaccines save millions of lives and sweeping tariffs amount to a huge tax hike on American consumers and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, politics has always influenced federal spending, especially at NASA. Just a few years ago, some on the left protested the telescope, claiming namesake James Webb discriminated against gay people when he headed the space agency in the 1960s. Now advocates on the right appear determined to eliminate climate-related research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Big cuts at NASA would play into the hands of America's rivals across the globe. China and Europe are working aggressively to overtake the American lead in science and technology, and actively recruiting top scientists who feel under siege in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a practical level, attacks on &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/scientific+research/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;scientific research&lt;/a&gt; could undermine the nation's ability to cure diseases, upgrade defense systems, or make computers and phones work better in the future. Critical risks—even world-ending threats—would be more likely to go unmitigated without the science to accurately assess them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with researching &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/gravitational+waves/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gravitational waves&lt;/a&gt;, Holz heads the Science and Security Board at the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists responsible for setting the legendary "Doomsday Clock," which ticks closer to midnight as the risk of Armageddon increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock, based at the University of Chicago, lost much of its relevance when the Cold War ended. Unfortunately, it's relevant again today, and stands at the closest point to doomsday in its 80-year history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Bulletin started, Holz explains, the overriding threat was nuclear war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. These days, additional factors push the world closer to the brink. To the extent &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/climate+change/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; leads to mass migration and conflicts over resources, for instance, it makes all-out war more likely. A man-made pandemic or misuse of artificial intelligence could lead to the same outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall, Holz's board decided to move the clock one second closer to midnight, announcing in January that the world was only 89 seconds away. Since then, he said, the group has been following the administration's actions and it's alarmed by the broad and deep attacks on science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board reserves the right to change the clock at any time, Holz said, not just annually. Anyone interested will need to stay tuned, but we're willing to bet that if the clock moves any time soon, it will be moving closer to doomsday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration's planned cuts at NASA are being repeated at other agencies employing scientists to do everything from vetting new prescription drugs to predicting hurricane landfalls. Similarly, Trump's pressure campaign on elite universities uses federal research funding as leverage, in some cases threatening to destroy years of work by disrupting long-term studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this page supports fiscal responsibility and eliminating wasteful spending, the latest moves have an ulterior motive. They are aimed at gaining control over institutions likely to push back against Trump's agenda by citing inconvenient truths: Climate change is no hoax, vaccines save millions of lives and sweeping tariffs amount to a huge tax hike on American consumers and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, politics has always influenced federal spending, especially at NASA. Just a few years ago, some on the left protested the telescope, claiming namesake James Webb discriminated against gay people when he headed the space agency in the 1960s. Now advocates on the right appear determined to eliminate climate-related research.&lt;/p&gt;

																																			&lt;p&gt;Big cuts at NASA would play into the hands of America's rivals across the globe. China and Europe are working aggressively to overtake the American lead in science and technology, and actively recruiting top scientists who feel under siege in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a practical level, attacks on &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/scientific+research/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;scientific research&lt;/a&gt; could undermine the nation's ability to cure diseases, upgrade defense systems, or make computers and phones work better in the future. Critical risks—even world-ending threats—would be more likely to go unmitigated without the science to accurately assess them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with researching &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/gravitational+waves/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gravitational waves&lt;/a&gt;, Holz heads the Science and Security Board at the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists responsible for setting the legendary "Doomsday Clock," which ticks closer to midnight as the risk of Armageddon increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clock, based at the University of Chicago, lost much of its relevance when the Cold War ended. Unfortunately, it's relevant again today, and stands at the closest point to doomsday in its 80-year history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Bulletin started, Holz explains, the overriding threat was nuclear war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. These days, additional factors push the world closer to the brink. To the extent &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/climate+change/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; leads to mass migration and conflicts over resources, for instance, it makes all-out war more likely. A man-made pandemic or misuse of artificial intelligence could lead to the same outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall, Holz's board decided to move the clock one second closer to midnight, announcing in January that the world was only 89 seconds away. Since then, he said, the group has been following the administration's actions and it's alarmed by the broad and deep attacks on science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board reserves the right to change the clock at any time, Holz said, not just annually. Anyone interested will need to stay tuned, but we're willing to bet that if the clock moves any time soon, it will be moving closer to doomsday.&lt;/p&gt;

Using wearable devices and brain imaging from over 4,000 participants, researchers discovered that even small differences in sleep duration and timing impacted brain volume and task performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teens with the earliest bedtimes had the healthiest sleep patterns, the largest brain volumes, and performed best on memory, vocabulary, and focus tasks. Despite the benefits, no group consistently met the recommended 8–10 hours of sleep, highlighting a broader sleep deficit during this critical developmental stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Teens who went to bed earlier had larger brain volume and better cognitive performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small Differences, Big Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Just 15 minutes more sleep made measurable differences in brain health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under-Sleeping Trend:&lt;/strong&gt; None of the adolescent groups met recommended sleep duration guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adolescents who sleep for longer – and from an earlier bedtime – than their peers tend to have improved brain function and perform better at cognitive tests, researchers from the UK and China have shown.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study of adolescents in the US also showed that even those with better sleeping habits were not reaching the amount of sleep recommended for their age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep plays an important role in helping our bodies function. It is thought that while we are asleep, toxins that have built up in our brains are cleared out, and brain connections are consolidated and pruned, enhancing memory, learning, and problem-solving skills. Sleep has also been shown to boost our immune systems and improve our mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During adolescence, our sleep patterns change. We tend to start going to bed later and sleeping less, which affects our body clocks. All of this coincides with a period of important development in our brain function and cognitive development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Sleep Medicine says that the ideal amount of sleep during this period is between eight- and 10-hours’ sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Barbara Sahakian from the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge said: “Regularly getting a good night’s sleep is important in helping us function properly, but while we know a lot about sleep in adulthood and later life, we know surprisingly little about sleep in adolescence, even though this is a crucial time in our development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How long do young people sleep for, for example, and what impact does this have on their brain function and cognitive performance?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies looking at how much sleep adolescents get usually rely on self-reporting, which can be inaccurate. To get around this, a team led by researchers at Fudan University, Shanghai, and the University of Cambridge turned to data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the ABCD Study, more than 3,200 adolescents aged 11-12 years old had been given FitBits, allowing the researchers to look at objective data on their sleep patterns and to compare it against brain scans and results from cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team double-checked their results against two additional groups of 13-14 years old, totalling around 1,190 participants. The results are published today in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that the adolescents could be divided broadly into one of three groups:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group One, accounting for around 39% of participants, slept an average (mean) of 7 hours 10 mins. They tended to go to bed and fall asleep the latest and wake up the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group Two, accounting for 24% of participants, slept an average of 7 hours 21 mins. They had average levels across all sleep characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group Three, accounting for 37% of participants, slept an average of 7 hours 25 mins. They tended to go to bed and fall asleep the earliest and had lower heart rates during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the researchers found no significant differences in school achievement between the groups, when it came to cognitive tests looking at aspects such as vocabulary, reading, problem solving and focus, Group Three performed better than Group Two, which in turn performed better than Group One.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group Three also had the largest brain volume and best brain functions, with Group One the smallest volume and poorest brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Sahakian said: “Even though the differences in the amount of sleep that each group got was relatively small, at just over a quarter-of-an-hour between the best and worst sleepers, we could still see differences in brain structure and activity and in how well they did at tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This drives home to us just how important it is to have a good night’s sleep at this important time in life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First author Dr Qing Ma from Fudan University said: “Although our study can’t answer conclusively whether young people have better brain function and perform better at tests &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they sleep better, there are a number of studies that would support this idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, research has shown the benefits of sleep on memory, especially on memory consolidation, which is important for learning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also assessed the participants’ heart rates, finding that Group Three had the lowest heart rates across the sleep states and Group One the highest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower heart rates are usually a sign of better health, whereas higher rates often accompany poor sleep quality like restless sleep, frequent awakenings and excessive daytime sleepiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the ABCD Study is a longitudinal study – that is, one that follows its participants over time – the team was able to show that the differences in sleep patterns, brain structure and function, and cognitive performance, tended be present two years before and two years after the snapshot that they looked at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior author Dr Wei Cheng from Fudan University added: “Given the importance of sleep, we now need to look at why some children go to bed later and sleep less than others. Is it because of playing videogames or smartphones, for example, or is just that their body clocks do not tell them it’s time to sleep until later?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by the National Key R&amp;amp;D Program of China, National Natural Science Foundation of China, National Postdoctoral Foundation of China and Shanghai Postdoctoral Excellence Program.

Longitudinal analysis confirms these differences from ages 9 to 14, with biotype 3 showing consistent cognitive advantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings offer insights into optimizing sleep routines for better cognitive development.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 13:16:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE1Wa2hVTDNnV2N4LUVFMjJHVWVZOFJFOENjdE1vMXp1czV2eVQ2MklRM1RuRnZsdHdieEFzWlJwMVY3XzhFanNzZUJ4bTNqTjIxRFJBUFF2MzNSdDlEOEtnZkZ0dmxOTmZqeWUtMFYyRDd6ejdJTGlF</guid></item><item><title>饮酒后肠道微生物群迅速变化-神经科学新闻 | Gut Microbiome Shifts Rapidly After Alcohol Use - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTFBvTzF2OUVkOTNjN1A2Z1Y5aHlpRUlXeGowTWhfNDlTb18zT3VHNTJRdHZJSS0wX2lyVXdvdVJ0TWlsWF9seEk1OEdrelJGbWtUdi1PVHpBZ0pocDZXeEE0ckVfNHBlcmpGSEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study shows that combining heavy alcohol use with burn trauma causes severe disruptions in the gut microbiome, leading to inflammation and a weakened gut barrier. Within a day of injury, beneficial bacteria plummet, harmful microbes rise, and levels of butyrate—a key anti-inflammatory compound—drop significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This microbial chaos fuels immune overactivation, as fecal matter from injured subjects triggered high inflammatory responses in intestinal cells. Encouragingly, pre-treatment with butyrate reduced this inflammation, pointing to a potential therapeutic path for patients suffering from alcohol-related trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microbial Breakdown:&lt;/strong&gt; Alcohol and burns together deplete good gut bacteria and SCFAs like butyrate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammation Spike:&lt;/strong&gt; Post-injury gut samples triggered strong immune responses in lab tests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Hope:&lt;/strong&gt; Butyrate supplementation blunted inflammation, suggesting a new treatment angle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Loyola University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens in your gut after a night of heavy drinking and a severe burn injury? According to a new study, it might involve more than just pain and discomfort. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Loyola University Chicago Health Sciences Division have shown that alcohol combined with burn trauma throws the intestinal microbiome into chaos, leading to inflammation and impaired gut barrier function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108998"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows the gut." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microbiome-alcohol-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Previous work has shown that alcohol can slow down intestinal motility and damage the gut lining. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work uncovers the microbial shifts and metabolic fallout of these injuries, highlighting a potential path forward: replenishing lost microbial metabolites might help protect the gut—and the rest of the body—after trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burn injuries on their own are already a serious challenge, but when alcohol intoxication is involved, outcomes become significantly worse. Patients admitted to the hospital with both conditions have higher rates of sepsis and mortality than those with burns alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous work has shown that alcohol can slow down intestinal motility and damage the gut lining. Combined with the physiological stress of a burn, this leads to a breakdown in the gut barrier, allowing bacteria and their inflammatory byproducts to leak into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found major disruptions in the gut microbiome one day after alcohol and burn injury. Bacterial diversity dropped significantly, especially in the small intestine. Beneficial microbes were depleted, while populations of Proteobacteria—a group that includes many potentially harmful species—surged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These microbial shifts were accompanied by a drop in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly butyrate. SCFAs are crucial compounds produced by gut bacteria. They nourish intestinal cells, help maintain the integrity of the gut lining and regulate inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Butyrate serves as a primary energy source for intestinal epithelial cells and is known to promote anti-inflammatory responses. In alcohol and burn injury, butyrate levels were significantly lower than in healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine whether this imbalance had functional consequences, the researchers took fecal samples from the injured host and exposed them to intestinal cells in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking: fecal matter from the injured group triggered much higher levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, in the intestinal cells compared to samples from uninjured host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This inflammatory response was strongly correlated with the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, a bacterial family that had flourished after the injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encouragingly, when the researchers pre-treated the cells with butyrate, the IL-6 response was blunted. This suggests that the lack of butyrate in the injured gut plays a direct role in amplifying inflammation. Butyrate fuels intestinal cells and seems to keep inflammatory responses in check, acting as a kind of microbial brake on the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although these findings were observed in an experimental model, the implications for human health are compelling. Many burn patients arrive at the hospital with alcohol in their systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how these conditions interact to harm the gut could help explain why such patients fare worse. If similar disruptions in the microbiome and SCFAs occur in patients, restoring those microbial metabolites could become a new therapeutic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights the importance of timing. The microbial changes and inflammation were observed just one day after injury, emphasizing how quickly the gut environment can shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This underscores the need for rapid interventions after trauma—perhaps through SCFA supplementation, prebiotics that encourage the growth of SCFA-producing bacteria, or targeted probiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that future studies will need to explore whether boosting butyrate levels &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; can reduce inflammation and improve outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also point out that standard post-burn care does not currently address the intestines or gut microbiome, overlooking an organ system that could offer therapeutic opportunities for burn victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the gut microbiome has gained attention in recent years for its role in everything from obesity to mental health, this research adds a new layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the context of acute trauma, microbial health might influence recovery and resilience. If so, protecting and restoring the gut could become a key pillar of post-injury care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this alcohol use and microbiome research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#97faf4fff8e2f3ffe5eed7fbe2f4b9f2f3e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mashkoor A.

The following day, mice were euthanised and faecal contents from the caecum and small intestine (SI) were harvested for 16S sequencing for microbial analysis and caecum contents underwent high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy to assess SCFAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-5"&gt;The intestinal microbiome of ethanol burn (EB) mice exhibited decreased alpha diversity and distinct beta diversity compared with sham vehicle (SV). EB faeces were marked by increased Proteobacteria and many pathobionts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-5"&gt;EB caecum faeces exhibited a significant decrease in butyrate and a downward trend in acetate and total SCFAs. SCFA changes correlated with microbial changes particularly in the SI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-5"&gt;Treatment of murine duodenal cell clone-K (MODE-K) cells with faecal slurries led to upregulation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) from EB faeces compared with SV faeces which correlated with levels of Enterobacteriaceae. However, supplementation of butyrate reduced faecal slurry-induced MODE-K cells IL-6 release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-6"&gt;Together, these findings suggest that alcohol and burn injury induce bacterial dysbiosis and a decrease in SCFAs, which together can promote intestinal inflammation and barrier disruption, predisposing to postinjury pathology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:54:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFBvTzF2OUVkOTNjN1A2Z1Y5aHlpRUlXeGowTWhfNDlTb18zT3VHNTJRdHZJSS0wX2lyVXdvdVJ0TWlsWF9seEk1OEdrelJGbWtUdi1PVHpBZ0pocDZXeEE0ckVfNHBlcmpGSEE</guid></item><item><title>响应式育儿重新布线敏感婴儿的情感大脑-神经科学新闻 | Responsive Parenting Rewires Emotional Brains in Sensitive Babies - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPRklFQkxoR2xTMUZNU2VHVE41MHlJTnQ4ckhvOVJLWGIwOGdZNXUxRFRONTRBMEhsMGVMN3IzOFotSElrSEFVMmczRTVNcTJvODR3Y25KVkJaTlRIeDhCWmUycU1GSVJnN3Z5dkJIUXM4QllKbXNUNVpseGdvY0VHeEE5S0NBUkZK?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Around 1 in 5 babies are born with a sensitive, unregulated temperament that may raise their risk for anxiety and emotional challenges. A new study shows that contingent responsive parenting—caregivers who accurately respond to a baby’s cues—can reshape early brain activity in ways that support emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infants who received this kind of caregiving showed calmer reactions to fear and more empathy, while those who didn’t showed brain patterns linked to emotional difficulties. The findings suggest that early, attuned parenting can be a powerful protective factor, especially for high-reactivity babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperament Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; 20% of infants have a temperament linked to later emotional challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Change:&lt;/strong&gt; Responsive parenting reshapes infants’ brain activity to support regulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Outcome:&lt;/strong&gt; These babies show calmer reactions and early signs of empathy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Reichman University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approximately 20% of babies are born with a turbulent and unregulated temperament, characterized by high sensitivity to new stimuli, a tendency to cry excessively, and difficulty calming down once emotionally aroused. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have identified this temperament as a potential risk factor for challenges in social-emotional development, particularly for the emergence of anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study found that contingent responsive parenting — that is, consistently and accurately responding to the baby’s cues and rhythms — can shape patterns of brain activity in ways that strengthen the child’s capacity for emotional regulation and reduce the likelihood of developing emotional difficulties later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, the researchers followed 51 mother-infant pairs over the course of the babies’ first year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At four months of age, observations were conducted to assess the infants’ temperament and to evaluate the degree of contingent responsiveness in the mothers’ interactions —how accurately and sensitively they responded to their babies’ cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one year of age, the researchers measured the infants’ brain activity using EEG and examined their reactions to fear and to witnessing others in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings show that early parenting influences the baby’s brain activity, which in turn supports their emotional and social behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infants with turbulent temperaments who did not experience parental contingent responsiveness developed a pattern of brain activity associated with emotional regulation difficulties, and showed heightened fear in unfamiliar situations and less prosocial behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, babies with similar temperaments who received contingent responsive parenting did not develop the brain activity associated with emotional difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, their brain activity supported more adaptive behavior: they responded more calmly to fearful situations and even demonstrated the beginnings of empathy and prosocial behavior in response to the pain of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tahli Frenkel, Baruch Ivcher School of Psychology, Reichman University: “These findings highlight the critical role of early parenting as a protective factor, especially for infants with more reactive or sensitive temperaments. Such temperaments can be very difficult for both the baby and the parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study’s findings are encouraging, as they indicate that challenging temperaments can be shaped with the help of an responsive caregiving environment. Babies with more intense temperaments need an environment that helps them regulate their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When parents are attuned to the baby’s rhythm, and especially to signals indicating whether the baby is ready to tolerate new stimuli from the environment, they support the development of emotional regulation and build resilience that will help the child cope with the challenges posed by his or her innate temperament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Raising awareness among parents, offering them emotional support, and providing them with the knowledge and tools to deal with the natural challenges involved in parenting a baby with a turbulent temperament can have significant and long-term effects on the parenting experience, on the child, and on the parent-child relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Developmental Psychology&lt;/em&gt; as part of a special issue in memory of Jerome Kagan, a pioneer in the study of infant temperament, reinforces the importance of early emotional connections in shaping a healthy developmental trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greater awareness, early detection, and tailored interventions have the potential to make a significant and lasting impact on children’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this parenting and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7c1015081d10521e19121d0e153c15181f521d1f521510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lital Ben Ari&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://idc.ac.il" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Reichman University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lital Ben Ari – Reichman University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001764" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Maternal Contingent Responsiveness Moderates Temperamental Risk to Support Adaptive Infant Brain and Socioemotional Development Across the First Year of Life&lt;/a&gt;” by Tahli Frenkel et al. &lt;em&gt;Developmental Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maternal Contingent Responsiveness Moderates Temperamental Risk to Support Adaptive Infant Brain and Socioemotional Development Across the First Year of Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first few months of life, infants display intriguing individual differences in how they react to novel stimuli in their environment. Infant “negative reactive” tendencies have been robustly linked to resting brain activity profiles that confer risk for maladaptive socioemotional outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The present study examines whether and how caregiver behavior in early infancy may interact with infant negative reactivity to alter the extent to which such tendencies predict risk-related brain activity profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the present study, 51 mothers (all White; age &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt; = 32 years, &lt;em&gt;SD&lt;/em&gt; = 3; 70.8% monthly household income &amp;gt; 3,400 U.S. dollars) and their infants (39.2% female at birth) participated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We measured infant negative reactivity and maternal contingent responsiveness to infant’s gaze during mother–infant interactions at age 4 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 10–11 months, we assessed infants’ resting electroencephalographic (EEG) 6–9 Hz frontal asymmetry (a marker of risk for maladaptive regulatory behaviors and withdrawal), infant fearful withdrawal, and infant empathic behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that maternal contingent responsiveness to 4-month-old infant’s gaze in naturalistic interactions moderated the relation between 4-month infant negative reactivity and 11-month resting EEG asymmetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results suggest that maternal contingent responsiveness alters the extent to which early reactive tendencies end up “embedded” in infant brain activity profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploratory analyses revealed that the interaction between maternal contingent responsiveness and infant reactivity predicting infant resting EEG asymmetry, in turn predicted infants’ fearful withdrawal and empathic behaviors also assessed at 10–11 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings demonstrate the critical buffering role of maternal contingent responsive behaviors in reducing potential maladaptive neural and socioemotional outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;

in 2025 and one million per year by 2060.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean people are powerless in reducing their risk, however, according to Dr. Joel Salinas, a behavioral neurologist and associate professor at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/blood-pressure-dementia-risk-share-surprising-link-study-suggests" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Blood Pressure And Dementia Risk Share Surprising Link, Study Suggests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Blood Pressure And Dementia Risk Share Surprising Link, Study Suggests&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salinas joined Fox News Digital in an on-camera interview to discuss what’s driving the spike in dementia cases and what behavioral changes could provide some degree of cognitive protection. &lt;strong&gt;(See the video at the top of the article.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest factors in the increase is demographics, noted Salinas, who is also the co-founder and chief medical officer of Isaac Health, a virtual memory clinic for brain health and memory issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS/mvaj7wvj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read On The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read On The Fox News App&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Dementia cases continue to rise in the U.S., with people over age 55 facing a 42% risk of developing the condition in their lifetime.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The baby boomer population, being one of the largest groups, is also the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/geriatric-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fastest-aging group;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fastest-aging group&lt;/a&gt;," he told Fox News Digital. "As we get more and more baby boomers — not just over 65, but into their 70s and 80s — we're going to see more and more of them developing some degree of cognitive impairment due to a plethora of reasons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age is indeed the biggest risk factor, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After age 65, our risk starts to increase. By the time we get to our 80s, that risk is about one in three," he said. "And then after 85, it starts to go up even higher, to almost one in two."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic could have played a role as well, the neurologist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is still being understood, but it seems like &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/coronavirus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Covid-19;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Covid-19&lt;/a&gt; also affected blood vessels in the body and the brain," he said. "So people who already had a vulnerability for developing dementia could have had an acceleration or an earlier presentation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/stroke-dementia-depression-share-17-preventable-risk-factors" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stroke, Dementia And Depression Share These 17 Preventable Risk Factors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stroke, Dementia And Depression Share These 17 Preventable Risk Factors&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has also shown that loneliness and social isolation can increase one’s risk of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cognitive decline;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that individuals who don't have a lot of social engagement are at a higher risk," Salinas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A recent study led by Johns Hopkins predicted half a million dementia cases in 2025 and one million per year by 2060.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's still a lot being done to figure out, you know, the chicken or the egg — is it that you're developing the disease and you're presenting with symptoms of loneliness earlier than others, or is it the loneliness and social isolation that increases your risk? I think it's probably both."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a genetic component of dementia, the neurologist said, but the good news is that it’s rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/smartphone-use-could-reduce-dementia-risk-older-adults-study-finds" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Smartphone Use Could Reduce Dementia Risk In Older Adults, Study Finds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Smartphone Use Could Reduce Dementia Risk In Older Adults, Study Finds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you think about risks and protective factors like a seesaw, these rare &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/genetics" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:genetic mutations;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;genetic mutations&lt;/a&gt; may outweigh anything protective you do, but the nice thing is that because they're rare, the chances are you don't have those risks," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So you probably have genetic risk that can be outweighed to some degree by protective factors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major study published last year in The Lancet found that almost half of dementia cases are potentially preventable with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lifestyle modifications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lifestyle modifications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many different factors to address, Salinas said, with proper nutrition and exercise topping the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;"Obstructive sleep apnea, which is a common sleep disorder, affects blood pressure, heart disease and brain health," the neurologist said.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addressing hearing loss by using a hearing aid can also help keep dementia at bay, according to the neurologist, as can staying socially engaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/respiratory-health/stop-smoking" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Quitting smoking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Quitting smoking&lt;/a&gt; and limiting alcohol consumption can also boost prevention, as does getting enough quality sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/dementia-risk-could-lowered-doing-5-minutes-day-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Health Boost And Dementia Prevention In Just 5 Minutes A Day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Health Boost And Dementia Prevention In Just 5 Minutes A Day&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entering a specific stage of sleep called "slow wave" or "stage three" helps to clear out the buildup of toxic proteins in the brain, Salinas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If someone is having &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:issues with sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;issues with sleep&lt;/a&gt;, we send them to see a sleep specialist to do the proper testing," he said.

  &lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span class="tag-term"&gt;News Release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2025-04-23T08:00:00-04:00" class="date-display-single"&gt;Wednesday, April 23, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;NIH researchers supercharge ordinary clinical device to get a better look at the back of the eye&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;
New technique brings retina into sharper focus

.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have leveraged artificial intelligence to transform a device designed to see tissues in the back of the eye into one sharp enough to make out individual cells. The technique provides imaging resolution that rivals the most advanced devices available and is cheaper, faster, and doesn’t require specialized equipment or expertise. The strategy has implications for early detection of disease and for the monitoring of treatment response by making what was once invisible now visible.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“AI potentially puts next-generation imaging in the hands of standard eye clinics. It’s like adding a high-resolution lens to a basic camera.” said Johnny Tam, Ph.D., investigator at NIH’s National Eye Institute and senior author of the study report, which published in &lt;em&gt;Communications Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imaging devices, known as ophthalmoscopes, are widely used to examine the light-sensing retina in the back of the eye. A scanning laser ophthalmoscope is standard in eye clinics, but its resolution can only make out structures at the tissue level—things such as lesions, blood vessels, and the optic nerve head. Next-generation ophthalmoscopes enabled with adaptive optics—a technology that compensates for light distortion—can make out cellular features, providing greater diagnostic information. However, adaptive optics-enabled imaging is still in the experimental phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tam and collaborators developed a custom AI system to digitally enhance images of a layer of tissue beneath the light-sensing photoreceptors, known as the retina’s pigmented epithelium (RPE). The first step was to teach the system to recognize image quality as poor, moderate, or good. The researchers did this by feeding the system more than 1,400 images from different areas of the retina, obtained using adaptive-optics ophthalmoscopy. Next, they fed the system corresponding images from the same retinal locations but obtained using standard ophthalmoscopy. An image sharpness test showed that AI improved clarity eightfold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our system used what it learned from rating the images obtained from adaptive optics to digitally enhance images obtained with standard ophthalmoscopy,” said Tam. “It’s important to point out that the system is not creating something from nothing. Features that we see in RPE cells with standard imaging are there, they’re just unclear.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These techniques involve injection of a dye called indocyanine green (ICG) into the bloodstream to increase contrast of anatomical features. In the eye clinic, ICG is usually used to image the blood vessels of the eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our ICG imaging strategy allows RPE cells to be quickly and routinely assessed in the clinic,” said Joanne Li, Ph.D., first author of the report and a biomedical engineer in Tam’s lab. “With AI, high quality images of the RPE cells can be obtained in a matter of seconds, using standard clinical imaging instruments.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RPE cells’ function is to nourish and support photoreceptors. A variety of blinding conditions first affect RPE cells, including age-related macular degeneration, vitelliform macular dystrophy, and Stargardt disease. However, RPE cells cannot be easily imaged in the clinic. AI-enhanced ICG ophthalmoscopy puts RPE imaging within reach of the typical eye clinic.##&lt;/p&gt;

GLP-1 would also make an excellent name for Musk’s next child since Æ A-Xii has already been used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Dr. Lisa Oldson, an obesity medicine specialist, told &lt;i&gt;The Swamp&lt;/i&gt; she is doubtful a diet change alone could account for Trump’s distinctly slimmer look. “Most people don’t lose [weight] that fast without meds,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The doctor explained Trump “looks like he’s lost more than 5-6 percent” of his weight, which is what she would expect the typical person to drop from “just lifestyle modification alone” over the course of a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item b-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="This was a slimmer line Trump at the White house Easter Egg Roll, where he studiously avoided all snacks." class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/BGSCKTVHTVAL7AVPVIYFBHGGMA.JPG?auth=0cbd289667a860e9343b69755b00ef65c737f143dd9b2b0e8ecf0af124f4d7bb&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=592" srcset="https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/BGSCKTVHTVAL7AVPVIYFBHGGMA.JPG?auth=0cbd289667a860e9343b69755b00ef65c737f143dd9b2b0e8ecf0af124f4d7bb&amp;amp;width=274&amp;amp;height=202 274w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/BGSCKTVHTVAL7AVPVIYFBHGGMA.JPG?auth=0cbd289667a860e9343b69755b00ef65c737f143dd9b2b0e8ecf0af124f4d7bb&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=296 400w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/BGSCKTVHTVAL7AVPVIYFBHGGMA.JPG?auth=0cbd289667a860e9343b69755b00ef65c737f143dd9b2b0e8ecf0af124f4d7bb&amp;amp;width=768&amp;amp;height=568 768w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/BGSCKTVHTVAL7AVPVIYFBHGGMA.JPG?auth=0cbd289667a860e9343b69755b00ef65c737f143dd9b2b0e8ecf0af124f4d7bb&amp;amp;width=1024&amp;amp;height=757 1024w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/BGSCKTVHTVAL7AVPVIYFBHGGMA.JPG?auth=0cbd289667a860e9343b69755b00ef65c737f143dd9b2b0e8ecf0af124f4d7bb&amp;amp;width=1440&amp;amp;height=1065 1440w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;This was a slimmer line Trump at the White house Easter Egg Roll, where he studiously avoided all snacks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;Ken Cedeno/REUTERS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“When we look at people losing 30 pounds, 40 pounds, 50 pounds, 80 pounds, 100 pounds,” Oldson said, “that’s much more often due to the newer meds, the GLP agonists,” and not because of diet and exercise alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Dr. Carolyn Williams, a&lt;a href="https://www.carolynwilliamsrd.com/about" rel=""&gt; dietitian based in Tuscaloosa, Alabama&lt;/a&gt;, said it’s possible Trump’s weight loss is a result of GLP-1 receptor agonists. However, she said those drugs can “make you feel bad,” and Trump appears to be happy and healthy on camera. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Press Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/karoline-leavitt/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/karoline-leavitt"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Karoline Leavitt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has no doubts about what’s behind the big trim. “As the results of his recently conducted physical concluded, President Trump is indeed in peak physical and mental condition as a result of his strenuous schedule working 20 hours per day, his exercise on the golf course, and his diet courtesy of the exceptional White House chefs,” she told &lt;i&gt;The Swamp&lt;/i&gt;. “The President is in a physical condition that most men his age could only dream about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Certainly, the billionaire president would have no problem paying the $1,200 a month for the get-slim-quick medication. But earlier this month, he scrapped &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/joe-biden/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/joe-biden"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s plan to cover the “obesity drug” under Medicare. It wasn’t such a great surprise. The proposal would have increased federal spending by about $35 billion at a time when Trump’s DOGE is desperate to show it is cutting costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services did leave itself a loophole, saying it may take another look in the future, and its newly sworn-in boss &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/dr-oz/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/dr-oz"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr Mehmet Oz&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has pitched weight-loss products on his show. Sure, the green coffee extract that Dr. Oz called&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/dr-mehmet-oz-health-claims-controversial-medicare-trump-rcna181085" rel=""&gt; “a miracle pill”&lt;/a&gt; failed to prove effective in a lab, and the original research paper had to be retracted due to invalid data. It’s also worth noting that Dr. Oz shot to TV fame thanks to &lt;b&gt;Oprah Winfrey,&lt;/b&gt; who was a big fan. She’s also a big fan of GLP-1 agonists and credits them with her recent weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item b-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="Donald Trump gestures with open hands and what appears to be a sneering expression.

From &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/274844/southern-style-oven-fried-chicken/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:crispy fried chicken;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;crispy fried chicken&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sheet-pan-balsamic-chicken-asparagus-8780757" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:grilled breast fillets;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;grilled breast fillets&lt;/a&gt; atop Caesar salads, it's hard to deny its universal appeal. After all, it's versatile, relatively affordable and often regarded as a healthier protein option compared to red meat. Chances are, if you're reading this, you’ve probably got some chicken in your fridge right now, just waiting to shine as the star of your next meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s almost impressive how much chicken many people eat, with rates continuing to grow. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025 (DGA), consider poultry to include all kinds of chicken, turkey, duck, geese and even game birds like quail and pheasant. These guidelines recommend eating around 100 grams of poultry as a standard portion, suggesting it be included in meals about one to three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before you start seasoning that drumstick, you might want to hear about this new study. According to some preliminary research published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;, our love affair with chicken may come with a side of unexpected risks—specifically an increased risk of early death from certain gastrointestinal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, you read that right. Put down the poultry seasoning for a moment, because it’s time to dig into what this study says and unravel whether your favorite chicken dish is as innocent as it seems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cholesterol-dementia-risk-study-11709528" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dementia Risk May Be Lowered by 26% by Improving Cholesterol, New Study Says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dementia Risk May Be Lowered by 26% by Improving Cholesterol, New Study Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Was This Study Conducted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although some expert panels, like the International Agency for Research on Cancer, suggests red and processed meats may be linked to negative health outcomes, research on poultry is limited, with only a few studies suggesting it might have a role in lowering the risk of death from all causes. &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; To bridge this gap, researchers evaluated the association between white meat consumption and early death from all causes and from gastrointestinal cancers, focusing on the effects of poultry consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on groups of people who were carefully chosen to understand health and lifestyle patterns. Over 4,000 participants contributed key information through interviews conducted by medical staff. These interviews collected details about their demographic background, general health, lifestyle habits and personal history. Measurements of weight and height were taken, and blood pressure readings adhered to international standards. On average, the researchers followed up with the participants over 19 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To analyze dietary habits, participants completed a validated questionnaire designed to reflect typical food consumption. Included was how much meat participants ate, dividing the consumption into red meat, poultry and total meat, sorted into four intake levels per type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their health status, including whether they were alive, had moved away or had died, was confirmed using local municipal records and a regional database. By analyzing these groups, the researchers aimed to understand how meat consumption might be linked to mortality. Advanced statistical methods were used to adjust for factors like age, sex and health conditions, ensuring the results were as accurate and reliable as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bone-health-mediterranean-diet-11711574" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientists Just Discovered a Huge Health Benefit of the Mediterranean Diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Scientists Just Discovered a Huge Health Benefit of the Mediterranean Diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Did The Study Find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to meat consumption, participants who died due to complications with gastrointestinal cancers tended to eat the most meat weekly compared to those who died from other causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating more than 300 grams of poultry weekly was linked to a 27% higher risk of death&lt;/strong&gt; compared to eating less than 100 grams, with the risk becoming higher as the amount consumed increased. The risk increased progressively as the portion consumed increased and was greater when compared to the same portion of red meat. Male participants who ate more than 300 grams of poultry weekly had more than double the risk of dying from gastrointestinal cancer compared to those who ate less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all 1,028 subjects who died, red meat made up about 59% of their weekly meat intake, with white meat accounting for roughly 41%—29% of that was poultry. Participants overall followed the Mediterranean diet reasonably well, which remained consistent across different causes of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/colon-cancer-risk-nutrient-study-11713908" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Underrated Nutrient Could Help Lower Your Colon Cancer Risk by 30%, New Study Says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Underrated Nutrient Could Help Lower Your Colon Cancer Risk by 30%, New Study Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who consumed more red meat appeared to have higher rates of death from different causes. On average, red meat enjoyers who died during the study ate more than 200 grams of red meat each week. For reference, there are approximately 28.35 grams in one ounce of red meat. This means if you have a piece of red meat weighing 8 ounces, it would be roughly 227 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumption of white meat, especially poultry, was related to certain mortality outcomes as well, particularly for those who ate well over 100 grams of chicken each week. While some cuts of chicken may weigh differently than others, a piece of skinless, boneless chicken typically weighs about 174 grams, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8030412/is-chicken-good-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a serving of chicken breast;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a serving of chicken breast&lt;/a&gt; clocks in at about 85 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data conflicts with other data that suggests a possible positive effect of higher white meat consumption on gastric cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all studies, there are some key limitations to consider. The study didn’t gather details on processed poultry consumption or how poultry was prepared, as the dietary questionnaire only asked broadly about poultry consumption. This leaves room for uncertainty in understanding whether outcomes differ between those who consume more fast-food chicken and have a less nutrient-dense diet versus individuals who eat grilled chicken at home as part of a balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study lacked data on participants' physical activity, a crucial factor in health. This absence might lead to a slight over- or underestimation of the diet-health relationship. It is important to note that, as an observational study, the findings can only demonstrate associations rather than establish causal relationships. Despite these limitations, these findings add to the limited body of research examining poultry consumption and health outcomes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-d-colorectal-cancer-study-11716723" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Vitamin May Reduce Colon Cancer Risk by 58%, New Study Suggests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Vitamin May Reduce Colon Cancer Risk by 58%, New Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Does This Apply to Real Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings from this study provide a valuable lens for re-evaluating our typical food choices, especially concerning poultry consumption. If you're someone who regularly enjoys chicken-based meals, this research suggests it might be worth paying closer attention to portion sizes and frequency of consumption. It doesn't mean you have to avoid chicken altogether, but understanding how much you’re eating and balancing it with other protein sources, like fish, legumes or other plant-based options, may help lower potential health risks. Incorporating diverse foods into your diet can ensure you get a variety of nutrients while possibly minimizing negative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors do note that meat cooking and storage methods significantly influence the risk of developing gastrointestinal cancers, suggesting an increased risk of gastric and intestinal tumors among those who preferred well-done white or red meat, based on past data. Protein-rich foods, when cooked at high temperatures or heated for prolonged times, generate certain mutagenic compounds that are known to be carcinogenic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, adopting alternative cooking methods like steaming or baking, and moderating the intake of charred or smoked meats, may reduce exposure to these harmful compounds and potentially lower associated cancer risks. Also, some data suggests consumption of more ultra-processed foods is linked to negative health outcomes. That means leaning on chicken nuggets and other poultry-forward processed foods may be better off enjoyed once-in-a-while vs frequently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/processed-and-ultra-processed-foods-i-eat-every-day-8424131" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I’m a Dietitian, and These Are the Processed and Ultra-Processed Foods I Eat Every Day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;I’m a Dietitian, and These Are the Processed and Ultra-Processed Foods I Eat Every Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; highlights a potential link between eating more than 300 grams of poultry per week and an increased mortality risk from all causes and from gastric cancers. Ultimately, when it comes to diet, balance and moderation are key. While this study sheds light on the potential risks associated with higher poultry consumption, it’s important to view these findings as part of the bigger nutritional picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicken remains a valuable protein source, rich in essential nutrients like B vitamins, selenium and phosphorus, which contribute to overall health when consumed responsibly. By diversifying your protein choices and being mindful of cooking methods, you can enjoy chicken as part of a nutritious, well-rounded diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to make informed choices about your health, consider incorporating variety, moderation and simplicity into your meals. By pairing portions of poultry with plenty of vegetables, whole grains and other lean protein sources (including plant-based sources), you can create meals that are both satisfying and nutritious. Remember, no single food determines your health; it's the overall pattern of what you eat, how you prepare it and the lifestyle you lead that truly matters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/2057942/mediterranean-diet-chicken-recipes-that-are-full-of-flavor/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:23 Mediterranean Diet Chicken Recipes That Are Full of Flavor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;23 Mediterranean Diet Chicken Recipes That Are Full of Flavor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/study-chicken-mortality-risk-11720104" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 11:20:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9zczc0VUJaZXh2V0J5S1RqUEF2ZlM3Tms1aFRkbWNnX1YyRG81MGZCelowakVNaTU2aTJHTmNXZ3l4LWNpYmtGcm5YZzVrb05OYkRxTmhiS29uVTJ5T0ctaGNpR0dFdmgwUU4wZ2I1TUdJcGJvdGRlX3VqcDNveDg</guid></item><item><title>这种简单的日常活动可以帮助您延长寿命并帮助您的心脏-独立报 | This simple daily activity may help you live longer and aid your heart - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPUXZUdDM5RDlWN0RMSUhqRVQ2NzFGeF9qRVJXMHZfUHZUcE9mWWJxTUJveW9iTF9rTWd4SGtCRm15akUtdUJpWGdjT3hTbkFwRVlqT0RJZ19PbFpraFlZNHAxOEhmOFAyQ2hYTFE1bDVpZG42QUwzR0FHSW5qSmlKc3gwN2JsZXFtWEdmM0swNmFpNGJNaFV2VFFVbkI0TmNXWFE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 eWQiqu sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 cGmNxG"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 iqSitv"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dlmCG"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 igdyzJ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cPkZJS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 fGzMFb sc-hez36s-16 fJelbS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 fiXggt"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 eSVQSf"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 cDGSNR"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 kxbAkl"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 kGYWZt"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chicken is a staple on dinner tables around the world. From &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/274844/southern-style-oven-fried-chicken/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;crispy fried chicken&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sheet-pan-balsamic-chicken-asparagus-8780757" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;grilled breast fillets&lt;/a&gt; atop Caesar salads, it's hard to deny its universal appeal. After all, it's versatile, relatively affordable and often regarded as a healthier protein option compared to red meat. Chances are, if you're reading this, you’ve probably got some chicken in your fridge right now, just waiting to shine as the star of your next meal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s almost impressive how much chicken many people eat, with rates continuing to grow.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025 (DGA), consider poultry to include all kinds of chicken, turkey, duck, geese and even game birds like quail and pheasant. These guidelines recommend eating around 100 grams of poultry as a standard portion, suggesting it be included in meals about one to three times a week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But before you start seasoning that drumstick, you might want to hear about this new study. According to some preliminary research published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;, our love affair with chicken may come with a side of unexpected risks—specifically an increased risk of early death from certain gastrointestinal cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although some expert panels, like the International Agency for Research on Cancer, suggests red and processed meats may be linked to negative health outcomes, research on poultry is limited, with only a few studies suggesting it might have a role in lowering the risk of death from all causes. &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; To bridge this gap, researchers evaluated the association between white meat consumption and early death from all causes and from gastrointestinal cancers, focusing on the effects of poultry consumption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study focused on groups of people who were carefully chosen to understand health and lifestyle patterns. Over 4,000 participants contributed key information through interviews conducted by medical staff. These interviews collected details about their demographic background, general health, lifestyle habits and personal history. Measurements of weight and height were taken, and blood pressure readings adhered to international standards. On average, the researchers followed up with the participants over 19 years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To analyze dietary habits, participants completed a validated questionnaire designed to reflect typical food consumption. Included was how much meat participants ate, dividing the consumption into red meat, poultry and total meat, sorted into four intake levels per type. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Their health status, including whether they were alive, had moved away or had died, was confirmed using local municipal records and a regional database. By analyzing these groups, the researchers aimed to understand how meat consumption might be linked to mortality. Advanced statistical methods were used to adjust for factors like age, sex and health conditions, ensuring the results were as accurate and reliable as possible.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did The Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it came to meat consumption, participants who died due to complications with gastrointestinal cancers tended to eat the most meat weekly compared to those who died from other causes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Eating more than 300 grams of poultry weekly was linked to a 27% higher risk of death&lt;/strong&gt; compared to eating less than 100 grams, with the risk becoming higher as the amount consumed increased. The risk increased progressively as the portion consumed increased and was greater when compared to the same portion of red meat. Male participants who ate more than 300 grams of poultry weekly had more than double the risk of dying from gastrointestinal cancer compared to those who ate less.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Across all 1,028 subjects who died, red meat made up about 59% of their weekly meat intake, with white meat accounting for roughly 41%—29% of that was poultry. Participants overall followed the Mediterranean diet reasonably well, which remained consistent across different causes of death.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People who consumed more red meat appeared to have higher rates of death from different causes. On average, red meat enjoyers who died during the study ate more than 200 grams of red meat each week. For reference, there are approximately 28.35 grams in one ounce of red meat. This means if you have a piece of red meat weighing 8 ounces, it would be roughly 227 grams.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Consumption of white meat, especially poultry, was related to certain mortality outcomes as well, particularly for those who ate well over 100 grams of chicken each week. While some cuts of chicken may weigh differently than others, a piece of skinless, boneless chicken typically weighs about 174 grams, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8030412/is-chicken-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;a serving of chicken breast&lt;/a&gt; clocks in at about 85 grams.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This data conflicts with other data that suggests a possible positive effect of higher white meat consumption on gastric cancer risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As with all studies, there are some key limitations to consider. The study didn’t gather details on processed poultry consumption or how poultry was prepared, as the dietary questionnaire only asked broadly about poultry consumption. This leaves room for uncertainty in understanding whether outcomes differ between those who consume more fast-food chicken and have a less nutrient-dense diet versus individuals who eat grilled chicken at home as part of a balanced diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, the study lacked data on participants' physical activity, a crucial factor in health. This absence might lead to a slight over- or underestimation of the diet-health relationship. It is important to note that, as an observational study, the findings can only demonstrate associations rather than establish causal relationships. Despite these limitations, these findings add to the limited body of research examining poultry consumption and health outcomes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The findings from this study provide a valuable lens for re-evaluating our typical food choices, especially concerning poultry consumption. If you're someone who regularly enjoys chicken-based meals, this research suggests it might be worth paying closer attention to portion sizes and frequency of consumption. It doesn't mean you have to avoid chicken altogether, but understanding how much you’re eating and balancing it with other protein sources, like fish, legumes or other plant-based options, may help lower potential health risks. Incorporating diverse foods into your diet can ensure you get a variety of nutrients while possibly minimizing negative outcomes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The authors do note that meat cooking and storage methods significantly influence the risk of developing gastrointestinal cancers, suggesting an increased risk of gastric and intestinal tumors among those who preferred well-done white or red meat, based on past data.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Protein-rich foods, when cooked at high temperatures or heated for prolonged times, generate certain mutagenic compounds that are known to be carcinogenic. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because of this, adopting alternative cooking methods like steaming or baking, and moderating the intake of charred or smoked meats, may reduce exposure to these harmful compounds and potentially lower associated cancer risks. Also, some data suggests consumption of more ultra-processed foods is linked to negative health outcomes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That means leaning on chicken nuggets and other poultry-forward processed foods may be better off enjoyed once-in-a-while vs frequently.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; highlights a potential link between eating more than 300 grams of poultry per week and an increased mortality risk from all causes and from gastric cancers. Ultimately, when it comes to diet, balance and moderation are key. While this study sheds light on the potential risks associated with higher poultry consumption, it’s important to view these findings as part of the bigger nutritional picture. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chicken remains a valuable protein source, rich in essential nutrients like B vitamins, selenium and phosphorus, which contribute to overall health when consumed responsibly. By diversifying your protein choices and being mindful of cooking methods, you can enjoy chicken as part of a nutritious, well-rounded diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you want to make informed choices about your health, consider incorporating variety, moderation and simplicity into your meals. By pairing portions of poultry with plenty of vegetables, whole grains and other lean protein sources (including plant-based sources), you can create meals that are both satisfying and nutritious. Remember, no single food determines your health; it's the overall pattern of what you eat, how you prepare it and the lifestyle you lead that truly matters.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Vitamin A is considered supportive care and typically used in countries where children are malnourished and have vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency in the United States affects &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622012238?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;less than 1 percent of the population,&lt;/a&gt; according to a nutrition report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F26D7YTPCFCGDL4K327FDAOFVQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The information gap has tangible consequences. Among parents, 24 percent who lean toward believing at least one of the three false claims say that they delayed or skipped some recommended vaccines for their children, according to the poll. That’s more than double compared with parents who say all three claims are “definitely” or “probably false” — 11 percent of those parents opted out of some recommended vaccines for their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F7CT2LCYNZB73PXJG7UNFPXOOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The divide is partisan, too. “We found that larger shares of Republicans compared with Democrats lean toward believing some of these falsehoods,” Hamel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N4FBUC7LNNARDD2TTILZJFRY3I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Overall, the majority of parents still believe that the benefits of vaccines outweigh the risks, Hamel said. But the number of parents that are skeptical — contending that the risks outweigh the benefits — has inched up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FCYGOMSB2JE3THS2MWZW43QD4M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“An erosion in confidence in vaccines down the road could have greater effect,” Hamel said. “With something like measles that can be deadly for children, and where you need high levels of vaccination to keep it from circulating, even some of these small increases could have repercussions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3GRIYRGWTVEKHGQM3J2WXJ3RQE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lauren Weber, Lena H.

                A KFF poll found parents who believed a false claim about measles were more likely to skip or delay childhood vaccinations.

   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. has now reported more than 800 measles cases in at least two dozen states. The vast majority of cases — more than 600 — are in Texas. In the midst of the outbreak, a &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-the-publics-views-on-measles-outbreaks-and-misinformation" target="_blank"&gt;new poll&lt;/a&gt; shows how much misinformation people are seeing about measles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The good news is the vast majority of people still have &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/30/nx-s1-5343997/measles-vaccine-hesitancy-enthusiasm-outbreaks" target="_blank"&gt;confidence in the safety &lt;/a&gt;of the measles vaccine, says &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/person/liz-hamel/" target="_blank"&gt;Liz Hamel&lt;/a&gt;, director of public opinion and survey research at KFF, a nonprofit health policy research organization which conducted the poll.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The bad news: People are being exposed to a lot of&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/14/1244690933/vaccine-expert-worries-child-measles-deaths-are-being-normalized" target="_blank"&gt; false claims about measles &lt;/a&gt;— and many don't know what to make of it.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"What we have seen is that a large share of people are at least somewhat uncertain about how to evaluate that misinformation," Hamel says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The survey was conducted earlier in April and included a nationally representative sample of 1,380 adults. Pollsters asked respondents about three false claims: that the measles vaccine is more dangerous than getting the disease; that the vaccine causes autism in children, and that vitamin A can prevent a measles infection. None of these things are true.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Only 5 percent of adults polled said they thought these falsehoods were definitely true, and a much larger share of respondents said they were "probably false" — but they weren't completely confident that these were falsehoods. Hamel says that shows there's a large group of people out there whose views on measles have room for uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And a significant proportion leaned toward saying these false claims about measles are probably true. For example, 1 in 4 adults polled said vitamin A either probably or definitely prevents measles. And 19% believed it was probably or definitely true that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is more dangerous than getting infected with measles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The poll also found a clear political divide. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We see that Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to lean towards believing this misinformation about measles," Hamel says. "And that's true among parents as well."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Most parents in the poll said they do keep their children up to date on their recommended vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But among parents who said that at least one of these false claims was probably or definitely true, 1 in 4 said they'd either skipped or delayed some recommended vaccines for their kids.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Those parents are more than twice as likely to say that they have delayed or skipped some vaccines for their children compared to parents who don't believe any of those claims," Hamel says, adding, "I think this is one of the more concerning findings from the poll."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hamel says one big takeaway is that in a world where people are bombarded with health information — and misinformation — on all kinds of media platforms, they don't always know how to evaluate what they're hearing or reading or who to trust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited by Jane Greenhalgh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INDIANAPOLIS — A Perry Township student is recovering after an overdose at school.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A letter sent to parents of students in the district obtained by 13News said the high school student was using a THC vape that unknowingly contained fentanyl. Narcan was administered to the student twice, and the student regained consciousness before first responders got to the school.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are thankful for our administration, police and school nurses for their swift and decisive actions today," the letter read.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The student was taken to the emergency room for further treatment. Their condition was described as "stable."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This incident highlights the very real dangers associated with vaping, particularly as many of these vapes are being laced with dangerous and illicit substances," the district wrote to parents. "While we are relieved that this situation did not result in a tragedy, it is crucial that we work together to ensure the safety of all students."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district urged parents to have a discussion with their student about the risks of ingesting hidden substances, which could have potentially deadly consequences.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Touching your toes is a common yardstick for flexibility. It's a handy method to gauge how supple your hamstrings are and how well your spine can move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And according to mobility coach &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/rogerframpton/?hl=en" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/rogerframpton/?hl=en" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Roger Frampton&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also a useful way to screen for potential kinetic chain issues in the hamstrings and back that could lead to injury down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Touching your toes is a position everyone should just have,” the founder of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://roger.coach/" target="_blank" data-url="https://roger.coach/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;The Frampton Method&lt;/a&gt; tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You should be able to fold your body in half the same way you should be able to sit in a deep squat position. I wouldn't say that if you can't touch your toes it's bad, you've probably just become tight in that area—or strong in that area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, he explains that if you do a lot of running, you're going to be using your hamstrings a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A consequence of that is limited range of motion. But you might be really good at running. Your hamstrings have become tight for a purpose: to make you more springy when you run.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-it-s-worth-being-able-to-touch-your-toes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why it's worth being able to touch your toes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why is learning to touch your toes—and improving the flexibility of your hamstrings—a worthwhile endeavor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-wnsEJe8C56n5X9Y4pF8vA7" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-wnsEJe8C56n5X9Y4pF8vA7 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having tight hamstrings can lead to back pain, according to Frampton, along with other issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you start to feel stiffness and discomfort further up the kinetic chain [the interconnected muscles, joints and bones in your back body], and your ability to touch your toes is lacking, that's when trying to develop this flexibility can help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-measure-flexibility"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to measure flexibility&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead of saying 'I can't touch my toes', measure what you actually can do,” Frampton advises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one video on his Instagram page, he demonstrates how you can bend over and use a chair, blocks, a Wellington boot, and even a pet dog to measure flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn't really matter what you use, as long as it's an exact measure,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To practice touching your toes safely, while also establishing a baseline for how flexible you are, Frampton says there are three rules to follow:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your feet together, facing forwards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legs must stay straight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And the toe touching test must be done first thing in the morning without any training.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-learn-to-touch-your-toes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to learn to touch your toes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up, is the training. First, Frampton recommends learning to hinge safely with a flat back fold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This teaches you how to hinge your hips so you're not just using your back to touch your toes,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn proper hinge mechanics, Frampton suggests holding a broomstick handle against your back, then folding forward without letting the handle come away from the base of your lower back or back of your head. “You don't even have to fold that far,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now practice folding forward fully. “Folding is half hamstrings, half spine. You are stretching your hamstrings, but because you're folding, you're doing most of the moving through your spine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're struggling to touch your toes, Frampton swears by a 30-second technique you can try while waiting for your kettle to boil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's how it works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets:&lt;/strong&gt; 3 &lt;strong&gt;Timing:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 seconds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pull up your trousers and mark on your leg where you can reach down to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Next sit on the floor with your legs straight, push your knees down with your hands and try to get your heels off the floor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you can't lift your heels, place a book under your knees and you'll find it's easier.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reach forward as far as you can and hold this position for 30 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After half a minute, stand up and try to touch your toes, marking how far you can reach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully you've got a lower mark,” says Frampton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do three sets of 30 seconds every day and incorporate this drill into daily mobility training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, once a month, keep retesting as you work your way to getting closer to touching your toes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

During an appearance on Fox News' &lt;i&gt;Jesse Watters Primetime &lt;/i&gt;on Tuesday, Kennedy claimed the testosterone levels in teenage boys have dropped significantly over the last several decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A teenager today, an American teenager today has less testosterone than a 68-year-old man," Kennedy said, prompting Watters to grin and laugh at the assertion. "Sperm counts are down 50%."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;section data-embed-group="read-more" data-embed-items="2" data-ad-dockable="true" data-redesign-embed="true"&gt; &lt;aside class="read-more-links" data-mod="readMoreTweak" data-immediate=""&gt;

&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="author"&gt; (Image: Fox News)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Watters seemingly tried to give Kennedy the chance to clarify his statement and the HHS secretary doubled down on his comments, adding that he believes testosterone levels have dropped 50% from historic levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite Watters's reaction, Kennedy's claims are not completely unfounded, although he may be off about the exact figures. While research on this specific subject is limited, one study published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism &lt;/i&gt;suggested testosterone levels in men have been dropping by 1% every year since 1980. This is nowhere near the 50% figure RFK Jr is claiming.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the causes of this potential drop in testosterone levels have yet to be identified, it's been long understood that testosterone levels naturally decrease as a man ages. However, a study published in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.urologytimes.com/view/testosterone-levels-show-steady-decrease-among-young-us-men" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Urology Times Journal &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;found similar results, noting that testosterone levels have dropped among young adult males from 1996 to 2020. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study notes that a number of causes could be responsible for this drop, including obesity and a lack of physical activity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite these studies, RFK did not mention them during his interview with Watters, presenting them as if they were his opinion rather than an empirical fact. Kennedy has made a number of specious medical claims since taking office, despite holding no medical degree of any kind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These assertions include claiming that autism is a "disease" that can seemingly be cured, despite most mental health and medical professionals categorizing autism spectrum disorder as a developmental disorder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are no blood or biological tests for autism; it is diagnosed by making judgments about a child’s behavior. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Research has looked at a variety of other possible explanations, including genetics, the age of the father, the weight of the mother and chemicals in the environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="35100980" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

During an appearance on Fox News' &lt;i&gt;Jesse Watters Primetime &lt;/i&gt;on Tuesday, Kennedy claimed the testosterone levels in teenage boys have dropped significantly over the last several decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A teenager today, an American teenager today has less testosterone than a 68-year-old man," Kennedy said, prompting Watters to grin and laugh at the assertion. "Sperm counts are down 50%."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;section data-embed-group="read-more" data-embed-items="2" data-ad-dockable="true" data-redesign-embed="true"&gt; &lt;aside class="read-more-links" data-mod="readMoreTweak" data-immediate=""&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Watters seemingly tried to give Kennedy the chance to clarify his statement and the HHS secretary doubled down on his comments, adding that he believes testosterone levels have dropped 50% from historic levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite Watters's reaction, Kennedy's claims are not completely unfounded, although he may be off about the exact figures. While research on this specific subject is limited, one study published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism &lt;/i&gt;suggested testosterone levels in men have been dropping by 1% every year since 1980. This is nowhere near the 50% figure RFK Jr is claiming.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the causes of this potential drop in testosterone levels have yet to be identified, it's been long understood that testosterone levels naturally decrease as a man ages. However, a study published in the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.urologytimes.com/view/testosterone-levels-show-steady-decrease-among-young-us-men" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Urology Times Journal &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;found similar results, noting that testosterone levels have dropped among young adult males from 1996 to 2020. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study notes that a number of causes could be responsible for this drop, including obesity and a lack of physical activity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite these studies, RFK did not mention them during his interview with Watters, presenting them as if they were his opinion rather than an empirical fact. Kennedy has made a number of specious medical claims since taking office, despite holding no medical degree of any kind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These assertions include claiming that autism is a "disease" that can seemingly be cured, despite most mental health and medical professionals categorizing autism spectrum disorder as a developmental disorder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are no blood or biological tests for autism; it is diagnosed by making judgments about a child’s behavior. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Research has looked at a variety of other possible explanations, including genetics, the age of the father, the weight of the mother and chemicals in the environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="35100980" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

The latest figures show the disease’s spread continues to accelerate — and indicates that the country is backsliding in keeping children from dying of preventable diseases, said Paul Offit, an infectious-diseases physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who directs its vaccine education center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LHA4Z4LRRRGLVBP263LHBLZ4II" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The jump in whooping cough cases coincides with a worsening national &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/08/trump-measles-vaccine-rfk-jr-response/" target="_blank"&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;, both driven in part by declining childhood vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LXDAQLCC25GO7A34ERQM2BGI3M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“You’re already now seeing children die [of whooping cough] in states where you haven’t had a child death in years,” Offit said. “For the same reasons we’re going backward with measles, we’re going backward with pertussis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BMCBR4WCJ5DWNBGBKRV42JISAQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;People of any age can become ill from pertussis, which creates a thick mucus in the windpipe and makes it hard to breathe. But the disease is especially dangerous for infants, whose airways are smaller and more fragile. Children with pertussis may cough uncontrollably, stop breathing and turn blue; when they inhale through a narrowed windpipe, it makes a whooping sound — hence the name, Offit said. The disease is sometimes called the “100 day cough” because illness can persist for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L4YRI65ZWBEYRB7DTK6PRSVT5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Pertussis will always be with us — even if the entire country were vaccinated, the bacteria would still be circulating,” Offit said. “The purpose of the vaccine is to keep you out of the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LRFMQYRE7BDH3JC67EMPETOESM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Vaccination rates against whooping cough have declined since the coronavirus pandemic, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt;: In 2023-2024, the vaccination rate among the nation’s kindergartners fell to 92.3 percent, from 94.9 percent four years earlier.

That tends to be long before most parents realize their child is ill, in part because early symptoms, like runny noses and a low-grade fever, are so similar to those of the common cold or RSV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GLNFNADGN5AZFA5ZJYEHJQXQGA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Once a person has more severe symptoms, like a persistent cough, antibiotics can only stop the spread of the bacteria to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IEQ6TMZZB5GB3DHOGNRF64UFXQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This is where I tell families, your child will be fighting to breathe, and even supportive care will not always save a child from death,” said Singh, who advises people not to delay vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BHE57DMSPNF4PIN7ROLETU5P4A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;National and state-level vaccination rates also can conceal a more complex picture at the local level, where diseases can take hold and spread, said Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs at the National Association of County and City Health Officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5O3B4EUBKBD75IYG3XN7LJB2EU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In Texas, for example, the 2023-2024 measles vaccination rate for seventh-graders (from schools that responded) was &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;above 94 percent,&lt;/a&gt; according to data from the Texas Department of Health Services; in rural Foard County, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the rate&lt;/a&gt; was just north of 66 percent.

But new research from &lt;a href="https://www.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.unc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; reveals early signs of Alzheimer’s decades before symptoms appear. Recognizing these signs could dramatically change how the disease is understood and prevented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is currently a major global health concern. Most existing studies focus on adults over 50 because dementia risk peaks in later life. However, a recent study in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(25)00097-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Lancet–Regional Health Americas&lt;/a&gt; suggests that cognitive decline related to Alzheimer’s starts much earlier—in young adulthood and early middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="early_risk_factors_come_into_view"&gt;Early Risk Factors Come into View&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Allison Aiello, PhD, at Columbia University's Butler Aging Center, the researchers analyzed health data from adults aged 24 to 44. They focused on factors that predict Alzheimer’s, such as heart health, genetics, inflammation, and neurological signs. Data was taken from two large waves of the &lt;a href="https://addhealth.cpc.unc.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health&lt;/a&gt;, known as Add Health. This national study has tracked participants since adolescence in the mid-1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Association between Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) Score and Cognitive Test Scores, National Longitudinal Study of Adolescence to Adult Health (Add Health)Wave IV and Wave V.

Of these, 4,507 participants underwent cognitive tests, health exams, and provided blood samples. Later, when participants reached ages 34-44 in the fifth wave, more detailed cognitive tests were conducted on 1,112 participants, including memory and attention tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="surprising_links_found_early_in_life"&gt;Surprising Links Found Early in Life&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used a tool called the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4878198/#:~:text=Interpretation%3A%20The%20CAIDE%20(Cardiovascular%20Risk,obesity%2C%20and%20physical%20inactivity)." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) score&lt;/a&gt;. This widely-used measure combines several risk factors into a single score: age, education level, sex, cholesterol, blood pressure, body weight, and exercise habits. A genetic risk factor called apolipoprotein E (APOE ε4) was also examined. APOE ε4 is known to significantly raise Alzheimer's risk in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were striking. Even among young adults, higher CAIDE scores—indicating greater heart and metabolic health risks—were linked to lower cognitive performance. Adults in their late twenties and thirties who had higher scores showed worse results in tasks measuring memory, learning, and mental sharpness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results clearly show significant associations between heart-related health risks and cognitive function well before age 50," Aiello explained. She emphasized the importance of recognizing these patterns early, adding, “The potential impact of our findings is substantial, offering clinicians a clearer understanding of the early emergence of Alzheimer’s risk factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="biomarkers_reveal_a_hidden_threat"&gt;Biomarkers Reveal a Hidden Threat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team went further by examining biological signs linked to Alzheimer’s. Scientists increasingly use biomarkers—specific molecules in blood or tissue—to detect early signs of disease. Two major neurological biomarkers examined were total tau and neurofilament light chain (NfL). In older adults, high levels of these proteins are often indicators of brain damage linked to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/fda-approved-sleeping-pill-offers-new-hope-in-the-fight-against-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In young adults, elevated levels of these same biomarkers correlated with weaker cognitive performance. Surprisingly, though, the genetic risk factor APOE ε4 did not affect cognition in this younger group, suggesting its impact may only appear later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Association between APOE Status and Cognitive Function, National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (AddHealth) Wave IV and Wave V.

Chronic inflammation has long been suspected as playing a role in Alzheimer's disease. Among these, IL-6 and TNF-α showed consistent links to lower cognitive performance, even at younger ages. However, C-reactive protein had mixed results—only half of the studies reviewed found significant associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Certain &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/microbial-infections-in-the-brain-might-play-a-significant-role-in-dementia-and-alzheimer/"&gt;Alzheimer’s risk factors&lt;/a&gt;—such as cardiovascular health and immune system markers—appear related to cognitive function even in people in their twenties and thirties,” Aiello said. “This means the disease could silently develop much earlier than we thought.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_path_to_early_prevention"&gt;The Path to Early Prevention&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, Alzheimer's prevention focuses on older adults who show early symptoms or mild cognitive impairment. But these new findings suggest prevention strategies need to start far earlier in life. Addressing risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and lack of physical activity during young adulthood could significantly reduce Alzheimer's risk later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Association between Amyloid, Tau, and Neurodegeneration (ATN) biomarkers and cognitive function, National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) Wave V, N = 588.

Early interventions that target heart and immune health could prevent cognitive decline long before Alzheimer's typically emerges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This groundbreaking research underscores the importance of rethinking Alzheimer’s disease prevention strategies. Waiting until symptoms appear may be too late. By identifying and addressing risk factors early, individuals could protect their &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/six-lifestyle-habits-that-preserve-cognitive-health-and-overall-well-being/"&gt;cognitive health&lt;/a&gt; decades before symptoms typically surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="research_opens_new_doors"&gt;Research Opens New Doors&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though this study brings important insights, Aiello notes that more research is needed. Future studies must follow younger adults into older age to confirm these early findings and better understand how early interventions might change outcomes. Understanding how Alzheimer's progresses through each life stage will be crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Association between Immune Risk Biomarkers and Cognitive Test Scores, National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (AddHealth) Wave IV and Wave V.

Rather than waiting for symptoms, doctors might soon use simple blood tests and risk scores to spot early problems. With this knowledge, targeted lifestyle and medical interventions could start immediately, potentially stopping &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lifechanging-study-restores-brain-function-for-alzheimers-patients/"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; before it starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study team included researchers from Columbia University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Of the now five confirmed measles cases that have been reported, this one is the third reported infant exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County said it also responded to two other measles cases this year among people who traveled through King County but are not Washington state residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Measles outbreaks are happening in every part of the world," said Elysia Gonzales, Medical Epidemiologist for Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County. "If you are planning international travel, it’s important to speak with your healthcare provider about what vaccines may be needed. Children need two doses of MMR vaccine: the first dose at age 12-15 months, and the second dose at age 4-6 years. Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally. Adults should also check to see if they are immune to measles&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Health—Seattle &amp;amp; King County said the public may have been exposed to measles at several locations during the infant's infectious period. Potential exposure sites include the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on April 15 from 4:50 p.m. to 7:45 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seattle Children’s Hospital on April 17 from 8:45 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. (Emergency department lobby)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seattle Children's Hospital on April 17 again from 5:30 to 7:45 p.m. (Forest B level 1 lobby and Forest Pharmacy)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seattle Children’s Hospital on April 18 from 11:50 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seattle Children’s Hospital on April 20 from 12:05 p.m. to 2:25 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County advises anyone who was at these locations during the specified times to monitor for symptoms and consult a healthcare provider if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe disease that causes fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. If one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected. It mainly spreads through the air after a person with measles coughs or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms begin 7 to 21 days after exposure. Measles is contagious from about 4 days before the rash appears through 4 days after the rash appears. People can spread measles before they have the characteristic measles rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can lead to ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, and rarely, encephalitis (brain inflammation) or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complications from measles can happen even in healthy people, but those at highest risk include: infants and children under 5 years, adults over 20 years, pregnant people, and people with weakened immune systems from medications or underlying disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is highly effective, with two doses providing about 97% protection against measles.

In people who had experienced stroke, mini-stroke, or vision loss, the plaque had 51 times more plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wow and not good," Jaime Ross, a neuroscientist at the University of Rhode Island who was not involved in the study but has studied microplastics in mice, told BI after reading the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's very shocking to see 51 times higher," she said, adding that in her research, a signal that's just three times stronger is "very robust and striking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What exactly the plastics are doing in there, if anything, remains a mystery. The new study offers some possible clues, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research has not yet undergone the scrutiny of &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fake-science-crisis-ai-generated-rat-giant-penis-image-2024-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;peer review&lt;/a&gt;, but Clark said he plans to submit it for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal later this year, after replicating some of their results.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;"We realized together that there really wasn't a lot of data on &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nanoplastics-water-bottle-micro-plastics-bloodsteam-tiny-pieces-plastic-2024-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;nanoplastics&lt;/a&gt; and microplastics in the vascular system, within blood vessels," Clark said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; had found that people with microplastics in their arterial plaque were more likely to have a heart attack or stroke or die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate why, Clark studied samples from 48 people's carotid arteries — the pair of superhighways in your neck that channel blood to your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference in plastic quantities surprised him, but his team found another concerning trend, too. Cells in the plaque with lots of plastic showed different gene activity than those with low plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the high-plastic environment, one group of immune cells had switched off a gene that's associated with turning off inflammation. Clark's team also found genetic differences in a group of stem cells thought to help prevent heart attacks and strokes by &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/supplement-scientist-heart-health-inflammation-daily-2024-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;reducing inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and stabilizing plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Could it be that microplastics are somehow altering their gene expression?" Clark said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that there's "lots more research needed to fully establish that, but at least it gives us a hint as to where to look."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ross, who specializes in the genetic mechanisms behind disease, agreed that more research is needed, but added that she thinks "these plastics are doing something with these plaques."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="7049dfc4-c891-4a1f-9760-e8ce1a0993dc" data-toc-id="7049dfc4-c891-4a1f-9760-e8ce1a0993dc"&gt;'We just don't know'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking microplastics in the human body is a new scientific endeavor as of the last couple years. It's not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark's team heated the plaque samples to more than 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit to vaporize plastic polymers and break them down into smaller organic molecules, which can be identified and measured by their mass and other properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the lipids in plaque can break down into chemicals that look very similar to polyethylene, the most common plastic found in everything from plastic bags to car parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because we know about this problem, we've taken a lot of steps to remove those lipids and confirm their removal, so that we're sure we're measuring polyethylene," Clark said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he added, "it's a big limitation, and it should be acknowledged that these types of methodologies are continuously improving."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark is trying to get funding to further study interactions between microplastics and immune cells in the walls of blood vessels. He hopes to expand this research beyond the carotid artery and also run some animal experiments to test for cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We just don't know," Clark said. "Almost all of what we know about microplastics in the human body, no matter where you look, can be summed up as: It's there, and we need to study further as to what it's doing, if anything."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While we were once encouraged to avoid nuts, thankfully, science eventually caught up to our taste buds—which means you can rest assured that convenient combos like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/249999/chocolate-nut-bark/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chocolate and nuts&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8064286/is-almond-butter-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;almond butter&lt;/a&gt; and toast are healthy choices. We now know that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;nuts provide a ton of nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, including heart- and brain-healthy fats, plant protein, carbohydrates, fiber and antioxidants. Each little nut is a package chock-full of potential health benefits, from lowering heart disease and dementia risk to helping maintain a healthy weight.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069681/benefits-of-walnuts/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;walnuts&lt;/a&gt; are probably the most studied nut—so we know more about them—pecans are climbing the ranks as more research is done on them. Case in point: We rated pecans as the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nut-for-better-blood-sugar-8713351" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;No. 1 nut to eat for better blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers at Pennsylvania State University were curious to learn more about pecans, and they published their findings in 2025 in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Specifically, researchers wanted to know how replacing snacks with 57 grams (about ¼ cup) of pecans a day affects certain markers for cardiometabolic diseases in individuals at risk for them. Cardiometabolic diseases include heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, to name a few.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After screening 191 individuals, 138 of them were chosen for the study; about 60% were female, with an average age of 46. All participants were free from heart disease and type 2 diabetes, but had at least one risk factor for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-you-have-metabolic-syndrome-8694742" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;High blood sugar levels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low HDL (“good”) cholesterol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High triglycerides&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Larger waist circumference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants were split into two groups: an intervention group, who replaced the snacks they usually ate with pecans (a total of ¼ cup per day), and a control group, who continued with their usual diet while avoiding nuts and nut butters. Participants had certain tests done at baseline and again after the 12-week study period, with strict instructions for what to avoid before the testing. The tests included:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Flow-mediated dilation (FMD), which is a test to see how well blood vessels dilate or relax in response to increased blood flow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), a measure that assesses the stiffness of arteries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lipids/lipoproteins (cholesterol, triglycerides)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glycemic control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, participants also completed three 24-hour recall food diaries throughout the study period—at baseline and weeks 6 and 12. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2020 is a rating tool used to assess diet quality based on the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Higher scores (up to 100) reflect healthier eating patterns. The scores of individual participants were calculated to find an average score for each group. At baseline, both groups’ average HEI-2020 score was about the same, at approximately 56. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though the FMD was the primary test researchers were looking at, there was no difference at the end of 12 weeks between the groups’ FMD scores. Researchers note that this may have been because all of the participants’ FMDs were within normal ranges at baseline, so there wasn’t a need for improvement. They also add that the amount of pecans eaten provided an amount of flavonols (a type of antioxidant) lower than what has been shown in previous studies to improve FMD. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the end of 12 weeks, there were also no medically significant differences between groups regarding HDL (“good”) cholesterol, insulin, HbA1C (average blood glucose level over three months), C-reactive protein (CRP, a measure of inflammation), or waist circumference.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What did change was cholesterol and triglyceride levels—and the change was significant. The pecan group saw a reduction in: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;total cholesterol levels of over 8 points (mg/dL) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;LDL cholesterol of over 7 points (mg/dL) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;non-HDL cholesterol (all types of LDL cholesterol plus triglycerides) by 9.5 points (mg/dL)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;triglycerides by over 16 points (mg/dL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, at the end of the 12 weeks, the pecan group’s HEI-2020 score increased by 9.4 points. They also showed an increase in healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and fiber compared to the usual diet group.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By the end of the study, the pecan group’s weight had also increased by about 1.5 pounds. While researchers are unsure why this occurred, it’s important to remember that weight can fluctuate by 5 lbs, even from morning to night—&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/one-thing-you-shouldnt-do-to-lose-weight-8763929" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;and this is normal&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some limitations of this study include that the dietary information was self-reported, which can have faults if participants don’t accurately remember what they ate. The study authors also state that, due to the number of secondary factors that were examined, statistical errors could have occurred. Finally, it’s important to note that this study was funded by the American Pecan Council, though the authors state that the APC played no role in how the study was conducted or interpreted.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that by replacing a “typical” snack with a small handful of pecans each day, you might experience a reduction in harmful cholesterol and triglycerides, and an increase in the quality of your diet. Depending on what your typical snack is, however, you might be able to add the nuts to it. For example, adding nuts to yogurt or a piece of fruit is a great way to balance the nutrition in the snack and make it more satisfying. And if you enjoy a piece of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013599/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-chocolate-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dark chocolate&lt;/a&gt; in the afternoon, pecans can perfectly complement dark chocolate’s heart-healthy characteristics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We love using pecans in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8031283/blueberry-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Summer Blueberry Salad with Toasted Pecans &amp;amp; Feta&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/blueberry-cobbler-energy-balls-8674600" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Blueberry Cobbler Energy Balls&lt;/a&gt;. Or spice them up savory like we did for our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7881849/rosemary-garlic-pecans/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Rosemary-Garlic Pecans&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While pecans lowered harmful cholesterol in this study, they didn’t see a difference in the beneficial HDL cholesterol—the type of cholesterol you want to see increase. Had the study been longer, participants may have seen a difference in their HDL, but since it wasn’t, we can’t say for sure. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What if you can’t eat pecans due to allergies or some other medical condition, or you simply don’t like them? Thankfully, there are other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/288593/10-foods-that-lower-cholesterol/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;foods that help raise beneficial cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and lower the bad stuff, including salmon, oatmeal, apples, beans and avocado. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Exercise has also been shown to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cardiologist-recommendations-for-high-cholesterol-8715965" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;benefit cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; by lowering LDL and increasing HDL cholesterol. Both cardio and resistance training exercises have been linked with improved cholesterol levels, so choose an activity you enjoy and get moving!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that replacing usual snacks with pecans is associated with lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Making this change also increased participants’ healthy eating scores. This goes to show that by making small changes, like replacing your typical snacks with healthier options, you can make a big difference in your health. This may be especially true if you replace nutrient-poor snacks—like a bag of chips or some pieces of candy—with pecans from time to time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pick a health habit to start with—like eating, exercise, getting more sleep or managing your stressors—and begin to gradually integrate the new habit into your life a little bit at a time. Over time, you’ll notice a shift in how you feel, and you may even see better numbers at your next visit to the doctor’s office. Those better numbers could mean lower risk of disease and better quality of life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And who knows? &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/3-habits-aging-study-8787260" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;You might even live longer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Until now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had not publicly described the outbreak in such stark terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;More measles cases were reported mostly in Orthodox Jewish communities in New York City and New York State in 2019. But health officials regard those as separate outbreaks, because they were fueled by multiple introductions of the virus by international travelers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;C.D.C. officials now view the spread of measles in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico as a single outbreak, Dr. Dan Filardo, who leads the agency’s task force for the measles response, told state health officials at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“This is the largest outbreak in the U.S. since measles elimination was declared in 2000,” he said.

A new study followed individuals self-administering psychedelics and found that while some experienced lingering visual aftereffects, most were not distressed by them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, delusional ideation slightly decreased a month after use, suggesting that psychedelics may not heighten psychotic traits as once feared. Traits like high sensory absorption and younger age were most associated with persistent visual effects, reinforcing the need for careful screening in clinical and recreational contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual Aftereffects:&lt;/strong&gt; About one-third reported lingering visuals like afterimages, but few found them distressing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Delusions:&lt;/strong&gt; Delusional ideation slightly decreased one month after psychedelic use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Factors:&lt;/strong&gt; High sensory absorption and younger age were strongest predictors of HPPD-like symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PNAS Nexus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychedelic drugs are seeing a surge of interest from mainstream medicine, and initial results suggest that psychedelic-therapy can be a safe and effective treatment for some mental health conditions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the side-effect profile is still incompletely understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, the use of psychedelics has been posited to carry a risk of triggering latent psychotic disorders or persistent visual hallucination, known as Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to better understand the prevalence and risk factors of such side-effects, Katie Zhou and colleagues surveyed 654 people online who were planning to take psychedelics through their own initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of those, 315 people were resurveyed two weeks after their experience and 212 people were resurveyed again four weeks after their experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample was 74% male, and 77% university educated. About one third had been diagnosed with at least one psychiatric condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors found a weak correlation between lifetime psychedelic use and both delusional ideation and magical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, on average, delusional ideation was slightly reduced one month after psychedelic use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that schizotypal traits may not be caused by taking LSD or magic mushrooms, in keeping with the principle that correlation does not imply causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a third of individuals surveyed at the four-week mark did have some lingering hallucinatory sensory experiences, such as intensified colors and afterimages. However, the majority of those who experienced this did not report being distressed by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest predictors of persistent visual aftereffects were the personality trait absorption—the tendency to be easily immersed in sensory or imaginative experiences—and younger age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This corroborates previous findings showing that young people and adolescents may be at a particular risk of HPPD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, empirical scrutiny of the potential risks of psychedelics should accompany changes in policy and access to psychedelic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychedelics and visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Katie Zhou&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PNAS Nexus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Katie Zhou – PNAS Nexus&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prediction of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder and thought disturbance symptoms following psychedelic use&lt;/a&gt;” by Katie Zhou et al. &lt;em&gt;PNAS Nexus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder and thought disturbance symptoms following psychedelic use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest in using psychedelic drugs to treat psychiatric disorders is growing rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While modern controlled clinical trials show a favorable safety and efficacy profile, it remains unclear if the risk of side effects would increase with broader use in more heterogeneous populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this, we investigated the frequency and baseline predictors of delusional ideation, magical thinking, and “hallucinogen persisting perception disorder” (HPPD)-related symptoms following psychedelic use in a self-selected naturalistic sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a prospective cohort study, symptoms were assessed in (⁠N=654⁠) participants at one week before a planned psychedelic experience, and at two and four weeks afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the sample, delusional ideation was found to be reduced one month after psychedelic use (⁠P&amp;lt;0.001⁠) with no changes detected in magical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings were in seeming opposition to positive correlations between lifetime psychedelic use at baseline with magical thinking (⁠rs=0.12⁠, P=0.003⁠) and delusional ideation (⁠rs=0.11⁠, P=0.01⁠), suggesting that schizotypal traits, instead of being caused by, may merely correlate with psychedelic use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, over 30% of the sample reported HPPD-type effects at the 4-week endpoint, although rarely perceived as distressing (&amp;lt; 1% of the population).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger age, female gender, history of a psychiatric diagnosis and baseline trait absorption predicted the occurrence of HPPD-like effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is in line with prior studies showing a high prevalence of HPPD-like symptoms in psychedelic users, which, however, appear to remain at a subclinical severity in most cases, explaining the comparatively lower prevalence of HPPD diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 20:38:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE4yanBEZEJaT29oT0twN1NBWk5HbXJkTzA2WVZpMThpSGhHS0ZGcFljZ2otai1yU1h1ajFFbE8xU1lIeFg0dDQxSkNjQ2R0aERyNk53dGkybnY3enVzSS14RWRpTk5QaG9KZktBdmNn</guid></item><item><title>科学家制作对抗疱疹和流感的口香糖- Gizmodo | Scientists Made Chewing Gum That Combats Herpes and the Flu - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxOOFRtY2Q0SjdWTzhBc3VpTFU0bmRKOWJ6a2oxbTQxeWdxandpbzVlOWRBRjZMeTVEWHZpU3d4UFJsQm52NHl4MndJQks4YVNOc2tqVU03NWttMVE2QUNLMERzVzZncWVZRzNZbXczZ29LV1IxV2dQdVFiZjRrUnpOS0FzTEljUEJwS2FJT1pYUUI1TUtQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Here’s something to chew on: antiviral gum. Scientists have developed chewing gum that can safely trap the influenza virus and the viruses that cause herpes, at least in the lab.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Dental Medicine developed the gum, made from bean powder. In various experiments, a protein found in the gum substantially neutered two flu strains and the herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2). The gum could prove to be a potent and easy-to-use tool for preventing the spread of these infections, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Penn researchers have been working on antiviral gum for some time now. Several years ago, they &lt;a href="https://www.dental.upenn.edu/news-events/2022/09/08/chewing-gum-designed-to-trap-sars-cov-2-in-the-saliva-moves-to-clinical-trial-from-dr-henry-daniells-lab/"&gt;developed&lt;/a&gt; gum from plant-based material that could effectively trap SARS-CoV-2—the cause of covid-19—in people’s saliva. Their latest creation relies on a similar approach but uses a different plant that’s native to sub-Saharan Africa and commonly eaten in tropical areas: &lt;em&gt;Lablab purpureus&lt;/em&gt;, also known as the lablab bean. Past research has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7380208/"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; that the lablab bean naturally carries a protein that can bind to a wide variety of viruses. This protein is called Flt3 Receptor Interacting Lectin, or FRIL for short.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers incubated samples of influenza, along with HSV-1 and HSV-2, with FRIL, finding that it could neutralize the viruses with sufficiently high doses. They also used a mechanical mouth to chew the gum and measure if enough FRIL would be released during chewing to reach these levels. They found that a two-gram gum tablet containing 40 milligrams of bean powder was sufficient to reduce the viral load of these viruses by over 95%.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“These observations augur well for evaluating bean gum in human clinical studies to minimize virus infection/transmission,” the scientists &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016(24)00808-6"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in their paper detailing the work, published in the journal Molecular Theory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure id="attachment_2000592983" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000592983" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2000592983" src="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-22-153751.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2025 04 22 153751" srcset="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-22-153751.jpg 962w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-22-153751-300x83.jpg 300w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-22-153751-768x212.jpg 768w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-22-153751-680x187.jpg 680w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-22-153751-896x247.jpg 896w" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 2rem), (max-width: 1279px) calc(100vw - 26rem), 680px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000592983" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers’ graphic detailing the creation of their antiviral gum. © Daniell, et al/Molecular Theory&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s research is still in the early stages, but they created their gum according to FDA specifications for drug products—an important step for anything intended to prevent infections. They also found that the gum could remain stable and safe to chew for at least two years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Antiviral medications are currently available for both flu and herpes, along with a seasonal flu vaccine, but all have their limitations. Today’s flu vaccines can prevent severe infections, for instance, but aren’t very reliable at preventing transmission to others once someone is infected. Antiviral medications for herpes can lower the risk of transmission to others, but many people often don’t even know they have herpes, due to a lack of symptoms. And herpes can spread through saliva even without causing illness (this can include spreading to someone’s genitals via oral sex). There are also currently no vaccines for either type of herpes virus.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;So the researchers are hopeful that chewing gum can be a novel and effective delivery system for preventing the transmission of viruses like flu and HSV-1/2 that spread through saliva. They’re also planning to test whether bird feed laced with FRIL can prevent bird flu from spreading among poultry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Controlling transmission of viruses continues to be a major global challenge. A broad spectrum antiviral protein (FRIL) present in a natural food product (bean powder) to neutralize not only human flu viruses but also avian (bird) flu is a timely innovation to prevent their infection and transmission,” said lead researcher Henry Daniell in a &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016(24)00808-6"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Personally speaking, I wouldn’t mind grabbing a stick of gum during the winter to keep my loved ones safe from getting my flu infection—though hopefully, it wouldn’t have to taste like bean.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Stop TB Partnership's Global Drug Facility (GDF) has cut the price of a key component of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) treatment regimens by 25%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The reduction, announced last week, cuts the price of pretomanid produced by generic drugmaker Lupin to $169 per treatment course when purchased through the GDF, down from $224 in October 2024. Developed by the TB Alliance, pretomanid is part of two shorter, all-oral treatment regimens recommended by the World Health Organization for treating MDR-TB—BPaL (bedaquiline, pretomanid, and linezolid) and BPaLM (bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid, and moxifloxacin).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Stop TB Partnership, which created the GDF in 2001 to promote equitable access to TB drugs and diagnostics, says the price reduction will save its clients upwards of $3 million per year. In addition, it establishes a reference price that high-burden TB countries can use in price negotiations when they are procuring pretomanid directly from suppliers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Combined with recent price reductions for bedaquiline, linezolid, and moxifloxacin, the price of a 6-month BPaLM treatment course has now been reduced by 47%, an amount the Stop TB Partnership says will save national TB programs roughly $37 million a year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This is a remarkable feat that couldn’t have come at a better time as future TB funding hangs in the balance," Stop TB Partnership Executive Director Lucica Ditiu, MD, said in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stoptb.org/news/global-drug-facility-announces-another-big-price-drop-25-reduction-price-pretomanid"&gt;&lt;span&gt;press release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An estimated 176,000 people globally are treated for MDR-TB each year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A new study shows that when energy is depleted—such as during a stroke—neurons begin releasing glutamate in abnormal, self-amplifying bursts that can damage nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a fluorescent sensor, researchers observed long-lasting, localized glutamate events that became more frequent under stress. These findings point to a dangerous feedback loop and highlight how disrupted metabolism leads to excitotoxicity, worsening outcomes in conditions like stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Crisis:&lt;/strong&gt; Energy depletion halts normal glutamate release and triggers abnormal, self-reinforcing surges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toxic Cascade:&lt;/strong&gt; Excess extracellular glutamate harms neurons and impairs synaptic function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intervention Clue:&lt;/strong&gt; Blocking NMDA receptors significantly reduced harmful glutamate release events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;RUB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our brain requires a constant supply of energy. A disrupted energy supply, as it is for instance caused by a stroke, can have serious complications. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from the research group Cellular Neurobiology at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, together with researchers from the Universities of Düsseldorf and Twente, investigated how an energy deficiency in the brain affects the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108973"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Conversely, the researchers were able to significantly reduce this type of glutamate release by inhibiting glutamate receptors, especially by inhibiting the subclass of NMDA receptors. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They observed that under stress abnormal glutamate release events occur that self-amplify and that may thereby contribute to the damage of nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by Dr. Tim Ziebarth, report their findings in the journal &lt;em&gt;iScience&lt;/em&gt; on April 18, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unusual glutamate releases occur more frequently upon energy depletion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under normal conditions, brain tissue is sufficiently supplied with energy, which is in part required for the selective release and reuptake of neurotransmitters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, if there is no longer enough energy available, this balance between neurotransmitter release and reuptake can quickly become disrupted,” Tim Ziebarth explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Especially in the case of strokes, where the blood supply to the brain is interrupted, there is often an extracellular increase in the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, which severely impairs the function of synapses and the survival of the affected nerve cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the underlying processes are only partially understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a model system, Tim Ziebarth observed a previously unknown, unconventional release mechanism that significantly increased the extracellular glutamate concentrations upon energy depletion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his measurements, he used a fluorescent sensor protein, which allowed him to visualize the release of glutamate in real-time. In addition to regular glutamate releases, which are typical for the synaptic activity of neurons, he also observed very unusual, local glutamate signals that were relatively large, long-lasting, and heterogeneous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Under normal conditions, these atypical events occurred only sporadically,” he reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, after inducing an energy deficiency, their frequency increased significantly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal glutamate release comes to a halt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, these events were the main cause of the increase in extracellular glutamate concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It seems that under metabolic stress conditions, such as energy depletion, these atypical release events are particularly favored, which led to the accumulation of glutamate,” Professor Andreas Reiner concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In contrast, the normal glutamate release by neurons, which itself requires substantial amounts of energy, came to a halt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar observations had previously only been described for a migraine model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In further experiments, the team was able to show that increased extracellular glutamate concentrations promoted additional release events. The process is therefore self-reinforcing. Conversely, the researchers were able to significantly reduce this type of glutamate release by inhibiting glutamate receptors, especially by inhibiting the subclass of NMDA receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study does not yet answer exactly how the unusual neurotransmitter releases occur and which cell types are responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Further investigations must also clarify how much this type of release actually contributes in stroke situations or in neurodegenerative diseases,” says Andreas Reiner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is well established that elevated glutamate concentrations are harmful to neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cfa5baa3a6aee1b8aaa6a3aabd8fbdbaade1abaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Julia Weiler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://rub.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RUB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Julia Weiler – RUB&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2025.112256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Atypical Plume-Like Events Contribute to Glutamate Accumulation in Metabolic Stress Conditions&lt;/a&gt;” by Andreas Reiner et al. &lt;em&gt;iScience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atypical Plume-Like Events Contribute to Glutamate Accumulation in Metabolic Stress Conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neural glutamate homeostasis is important for health and disease. Ischemic conditions, like stroke, cause imbalances in glutamate release and uptake due to energy depletion and depolarization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We here used the glutamate sensor SF-iGluSnFR(A184V) to probe how chemical ischemia affects the extracellular glutamate dynamics in slice cultures from mouse cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SF-iGluSnFR imaging showed spontaneous glutamate release indicating synchronous network activity, similar to calcium imaging with GCaMP6f. Glutamate imaging further revealed local, atypically large, and long-lasting plume-like release events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plumes occurred with low frequency, independent of network activity, and persisted in tetrodotoxin (TTX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking glutamate uptake with TFB-TBOA favored plumes, whereas blocking ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) suppressed plumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During chemical ischemia plumes became more pronounced, overly abundant and contributed to large-scale glutamate accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar plumes were previously observed in cortical spreading depression and migraine models, and they may thus be a more general consequence of glutamate uptake dysfunctions in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

A large-scale genetic study found that people with higher genetic risk for schizophrenia tend to have thinner retinas, even in the absence of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These subtle changes were detected using optical coherence tomography, a fast and non-invasive eye scan. The findings also support the inflammation hypothesis of schizophrenia, suggesting new possibilities for early detection and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retinal Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher genetic risk for schizophrenia is associated with thinner retinas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Invasive Detection:&lt;/strong&gt; Retinal thickness can be measured in minutes using optical coherence tomography.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammation Connection:&lt;/strong&gt; Genetic variants tied to inflammation may underlie both brain and retinal changes in schizophrenia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Zurich&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The retina is part of the central nervous system and therefore a direct extension of the brain. This is why changes in the brain could potentially also be detected in our eyes. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international team of researchers led by the University of Zurich and the University Hospital of Psychiatry Zurich has now tackled this very question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108969"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an eye." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study shows that higher genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia is indeed associated with thinner retinas. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, the researchers examined whether changes in our nerve connections are linked to a genetic risk for schizophrenia, as impaired neural information processing is one of the main characteristics of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies suggest that schizophrenia not only reduces volume of gray matter in the brains of those affected, but that it also leads to loss of retinal tissue. However, whether these changes are the cause of schizophrenia or a consequence of the disorder has remained unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retinal health could also be affected by schizophrenia itself, for example through antipsychotic medication, lifestyle factors or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensive use of data from healthy individuals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To investigate whether the risk of developing schizophrenia has an effect on the central nervous system, we examined tens of thousands of healthy individuals,” says Finn Rabe, first author of the study and postdoc at the University of Zurich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We then calculated polygenic risk scores for each individual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were able to use extensive genetic and retinal data taken from the UK Biobank, a large biomedical database containing data from over half a million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You could say that the scale of the UK Biobank’s data has revolutionized biomedical research,” the researcher adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thin retina, elevated risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study shows that higher genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia is indeed associated with thinner retinas. However, the effects are small and can only be reliably demonstrated in large-scale studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the study’s findings is that, unlike changes in the brain, changes in the retina are easy to detect using non-invasive and inexpensive retinal measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to optical coherence tomography, which can be described as a kind of ultrasound for the eye, retinal thickness can be measured within a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This offers a promising outlook for prevention. “Our study shows the potential of using optical coherence tomography in clinical practice. But large-scale longitudinal studies are needed to examine how useful it will be for prevention,” says Finn Rabe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perspectives for new therapies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key finding of the study concerns genetic variants associated with inflammatory processes in the brain. These may also contribute to structural changes in the retina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study thus offers further support for the inflammation hypothesis of schizophrenia, i.e., the idea that inflammatory processes contribute to the development or progression of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If this hypothesis is confirmed, inflammation could be interrupted by medication, potentially enabling us to improve treatment possibilities in the future,” says Rabe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this visual neuroscience and schizophrenia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#55383039343b3c307b3b2c3330393027153e3a3838203b3c3e34213c3a3b7b202f3d7b363d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Melanie Nyfeler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uzh.ch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Zurich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Melanie Nyfeler – University of Zurich&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s44220-025-00414-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia through neuroinflammatory pathways associated with retinal thinness&lt;/a&gt;” by Finn Rabe et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia through neuroinflammatory pathways associated with retinal thinness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is associated with structural and functional changes in the central nervous system, including the most distal part of it, the retina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the question of whether retinal atrophy is present before individuals develop schizophrenia or is a secondary consequence of the disorder remains unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we address this question by examining the association between polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia and retinal morphologies in individuals without a schizophrenia diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used population data for 34,939 white British and Irish individuals from the UK Biobank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our robust regression results show that higher polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia were associated with thinner overall maculae, while controlling for confounding factors (&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; = −0.17, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.018).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we found that greater polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia specific to neuroinflammation gene sets were associated with thinner ganglion cell inner plexiform layers (&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; = −0.10, self-contained &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.014, competitive &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results provide new evidence for genetic factors that could predispose individuals to heightened neuroinflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, these responses could contribute to neurodegenerative processes such as retinal thinning.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 19:45:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFA3RWlFNTZ5aFRrdEZLNHo2SmNaT0U2NFJNZENVY291WnVhWTJETFVJd29ZNjFFQUJOS2QzTHkyLTlUR01pN2dHNzFsRTUyOGVzdFViNURqUzNfT21oU2JkeEt2Rmc4VmpxXy00VWtJNUkzeUJZTEE</guid></item><item><title>乳腺癌细胞如何休眠并多年未被发现，以及为什么它们后来醒来并转移- Medical Xpress | How breast cancer cells become dormant and remain undetected for years, and why they later wake up and metastasize - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxPU1JKSW5iajVaX24xazd1NWEzbWtGSklmYWZXajNsZHNQQmx4eVl5NktNV08yTnBLdkRYQkxDTHZxWGRUZkdZWTVhRld2Nld6MVdTbUk1RW5PZHoyekJ3bXVtNktnc3dTV1RaY2pSZ2sxVXNjQXM2T2Z2UHc1REhjWmQzVVY0UWVzVEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breast cancer is becoming increasingly treatable, but in some cases the disease can resurface even decades after a patient has been declared cancer free. This is because of cells that detach from the original tumor and hide in a dormant state in the breast or other organs.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Little is known about the mechanisms responsible for dormancy in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;, and even less is known about what causes these cells to suddenly wake up. A new study from the laboratory of Israel Prize laureate Prof. Yosef Yarden at the Weizmann Institute of Science, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scisignal.ado3473" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Signaling&lt;/i&gt;, reveals the mechanism that puts &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/breast+cancer+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;breast cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; to sleep, as well as the reason that they emerge from dormancy more aggressive than they were before they became dormant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the earliest stage of embryonic development, through sexual maturation to the production of breast milk during pregnancy and after childbirth, breast tissue changes throughout a woman's life. These changes are made possible by the metamorphosis that breast tissue cells undergo, from the early developmental stage, known as mesenchymal, when the cells are round, highly mobile and dividing rapidly, to the more mature, epithelial stage, when they are somewhat cubical, less active and dividing slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cells move back and forth between these stages in a controlled and gradual process, but sometimes they go out of control, dividing rapidly and becoming malignant. This cancer process begins when mature cells return to their earlier, developmental stage, which allows them to divide rapidly, create tumor tissue and even migrate to other tissues. Later on, however, the cancer can benefit from exactly the opposite process: Cells that have spread throughout the body can revert to their mature state, becoming immobile and slow. Essentially, they become dormant.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Because of the major similarities between entry into dormancy and the maturation process of epithelial cells, scientists in Yarden's lab in Weizmann's Immunology and Regenerative Biology Department postulated that they might be able to induce a state of dormancy in breast cancer cells by imitating the natural process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a three-dimensional model of a cancerous tumor environment developed by Dr. Dalit Barkan of Haifa University, the researchers, led by Dr. Diana Drago-Garcia from Yarden's team, genetically modified human breast cancer cells of the most aggressive type, called &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/triple-negative+breast+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;triple-negative breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, to produce higher levels of OVOL proteins, which are known to be involved in the natural maturation of epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model showed that increasing the expression of two OVOL proteins halts the lifecycle of aggressive cancer cells and induces dormancy. In parallel, the researchers showed, in female mice implanted with human tumor tissue, that over-expression of OVOL inhibits the growth of the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although halting the lifecycle of cancer cells and slowing tumor growth might sound like good news and perhaps even the basis for a future treatment, it is known that cancer patients' breast tissue contains elevated levels of one of the OVOL proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists therefore hypothesized that while this protein, OVOL1, slows cancer in the short term, it is beneficial to cancerous cells in the long term, enabling them to enter a state of dormancy and survive for years without being detected. When conditions in the body change and the level of OVOL1 drops, the cancer comes back to life and is more aggressive than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with these findings, the researchers began to study how the cancer affects the expression levels of OVOL proteins, putting tumor cells to sleep or waking them up. One key finding was that certain growth factors boost OVOL1 expression, but the steroid hormone estrogen suppresses it. The scientists went on to show that patients with low levels of estrogen receptors and high levels of OVOL1 tend to develop more aggressive cancer and have lower chances of survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings could pave the way for preventing cancer cells from going dormant or stopping dormant cells from reawakening," Yarden says. "We know, for example, that fat tissue takes control of estrogen production during menopause. So, we can assume that weight gain in older women who had cancer when they were younger could increase the risk of dormant cancer resurfacing because of increased estrogen production and the associated drop in OVOL1 expression. In the future, these hypotheses can be tested in animal models and in human patients."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Changing in their sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the questions that remained unanswered was why breast cancer tends to be more aggressive when it awakens from a state of dormancy. To uncover the underlying mechanisms, the researchers traced the molecular signaling pathway through which OVOL1 induces dormancy. They discovered that this pathway triggers an accumulation of unstable molecules known as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/free+radicals/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;free radicals&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to widespread cellular damage, cell cycle arrest and dormancy. This buildup was surprising, since these molecules had not previously been linked to dormancy in cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, the researchers, working with Prof. Emeritus Yosef Shiloh of Tel Aviv University, showed that the continuous cellular stress within the dormant cells, resulting from the accumulation of the free radicals, changes the expression and function of proteins in the cells' nuclei, which house their &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+material/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic material&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, the genetic material is oxidized and its integrity is compromised, as is the functioning of three key proteins involved in DNA repair mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists believe that the widespread damage to the genetic material and the failure of the repair mechanisms explain why, when a cancer cell awakens, it carries numerous mutations, making it more aggressive and resistant to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The common belief is that dormant cancer cells exist in a suspended state, but we have shown that during their so-called sleep they accumulate DNA mutations because of the oxidative process, and they undergo a major change," Yarden explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This discovery is consistent with the analysis of tissue samples from aggressive breast cancer tumors. Importantly, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/breast+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; is not the only malignancy that enters a state of dormancy, so understanding the mechanisms of dormancy could lead to new treatments for various other types of cancer, as well."&lt;/p&gt;

The thinking is that this fast-tracks muscle growth. Cox says “aiming to push yourself anywhere from 1-3 reps shy of failure seems to be beneficial,” findings which are backed up by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4731492/"&gt;multiple studies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I need to be obsessed with a high protein diet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything from yogurt to cereal is touted as high protein at the moment, but does adding protein to your diet make a difference?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve learned the principles of building muscle, and the most efficient way to do it, above. But what about the actual building blocks of muscle itself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In order to build muscle, the body must be in what is called an &lt;em&gt;anabolic state&lt;/em&gt;,” says Cox. To get into this state, you need to be taking on more calories than you’re burning off. Think of it like a construction site. The more bricks you make available, the faster the building can grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same is true of muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An adequate protein consumption stimulates muscle protein synthesis, which helps to build up your muscle fibers,” says Cox. “A protein intake of 1.6-2.2 gram per kilogram of bodyweight is considered to be optimal for maximizing muscle growth.”  In other words, if you weigh about 175 pounds, you should aim for a daily protein intake of 128g-176g.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s true that protein can make you feel full and is therefore a way to lower calorie intake if you’re trying to lose weight, it isn’t calorie &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt;, so you will still see you weight gain if you overdo it. Plus, your bowels won’t be in the best shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Carbohydrates are also really important when trying to build muscle as they are the body’s main source of energy for workouts,” Weston notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t sleep on healthy fats, either. “They are a great source of energy for exercising, so you can push yourself harder in your workouts and therefore build muscle,” says Weston. “Plus, fats are also so important for hormone and cell health, including muscle cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there any truth behind the fad workouts and diets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry, but no. “I am a firm believer that silver bullets don’t exist, particularly when it comes to fitness,” says Cox. “The solution you’re actually searching for is right in front of you: consistency over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weston seconds that: “Building muscle shouldn’t feel too complicated. Just stick to a routine, with proper form and allowing a few rest days per week, rather than trying to follow a fad workout program.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the fastest way to build muscle?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re exercising a couple of times per week and have adjusted your diet accordingly, Weston reckons you’ll see results in about six to eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s quite a slow process,” she says. Nor, Cox adds, can it be accelerated—without taking steroids, that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people will try and shortcut the process by doing more workouts or doing longer workouts and while that seems like it should work, it will often just cause more fatigue without any additional stimulation,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 19:36:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE9lMXhrX0pTdEFVaWgxSTQ5VlV1aVBDaXhjUlVJME8yOFV0Q2xVQU1YSlV0dkVwMEVYQnhpWGN5U1p6ZUFUMF8xcnlUR01hdlliZzlRNWUtZTQ0T0VkcHNmcU5EeTdXZkE3Sk1SX3NBSQ</guid></item><item><title>科学说，关注这14个风险因素可以降低痴呆症的风险-《财富》杂志 | Paying attention to these 14 risk factors can reduce your risk of dementia, science says - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE9XZnZGVlVJRmtMenNJX2kxVVJvZzJrR0lpZklYdy1oMlRwQnZ4aXVYbFY2ZHFERkNXLUxBVXRJS2wtak12NXNmS012VEdWamhtYjZvS1pZYl9qNlllak1jb3FXcVItYmxxTHQtdWRKMGpDM29G?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fortune</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 19:28:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE9XZnZGVlVJRmtMenNJX2kxVVJvZzJrR0lpZklYdy1oMlRwQnZ4aXVYbFY2ZHFERkNXLUxBVXRJS2wtak12NXNmS012VEdWamhtYjZvS1pZYl9qNlllak1jb3FXcVItYmxxTHQtdWRKMGpDM29G</guid></item><item><title>得益于多巴胺，您的大脑从恐惧中学习-神经科学新闻 | Your Brain Learns From Fear, Thanks to Dopamine - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE9TVEpFLVNFM3ZFd0ZRWC10d2JUdGU3M2VJclg1QVJtRUFjbm5qSlp2NmUtYy1MYkVjbllWMlRjbk9zbGt3VlV2TmQ0R2laa1ZyT0dTVU0yVmtKUGVRLVhkTm5MbmwxSzNFWE9qN1pTdmxBdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research reveals how dopamine helps the brain learn to avoid unpleasant outcomes by responding differently in distinct brain regions during negative experiences. In a study with mice, scientists tracked dopamine activity over time as animals learned to escape an adverse event, showing that one brain area adapted early in learning while another supported long-term avoidance behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings challenge simplistic views of dopamine as purely “rewarding” and suggest it plays a critical role in adaptive — and maladaptive — learning from threats. The study may offer insights into psychiatric conditions marked by excessive avoidance, like anxiety and OCD, and underscores why the trendy idea of a “dopamine detox” misses the complexity of this vital brain chemical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine Evolves With Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; Dopamine activity changes over time depending on how well an animal learns to avoid danger.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different Brain Areas, Different Roles:&lt;/strong&gt; The ventromedial shell responds early in avoidance learning; the core supports long-term threat prediction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oversimplified Detox Trend:&lt;/strong&gt; The popular “dopamine detox” wellness trend ignores dopamine’s crucial role in adaptive behavior and learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine is the brain’s motivational spark, driving us to chase what feels good, say scrolling another reel on social media, and steer clear of what doesn’t, like touching a hot stove. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But scientists haven’t fully understood how dopamine helps us learn to avoid bad outcomes — until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108965"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox.jpg" alt="This shows a woman's head." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;They found that the two areas of the nucleus accumbens responded differently. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from Northwestern University shows that dopamine signals in two key brain areas involved in motivation and learning respond differently to negative experiences, helping the brain adapt based on whether a situation is predictable or controllable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While previous research has shown that dopamine can respond to negative experiences, this is the first study to track how those signals evolve over time as animals move from novices to experts in avoiding them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study will be published April 22 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Current Biology. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors said the findings help explain how we learn from bad experiences, and why some people learn to avoid danger better than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also shed light on how excessive avoidance — a hallmark symptom of multiple psychiatric conditions such as anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression — may come to be via alterations in dopamine function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can lead to an overestimation of danger in the environment and a decreased quality of life as the brain prioritizes avoiding certain experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the study helps explain why the concept behind the recent “dopamine-detox” wellness trend is too simplistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dopamine is not all good or all bad,” said first author Gabriela Lopez, a doctoral candidate in the Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It rewards us for good things but also helps us tune into cues that signal trouble, learn from consequences and continuously adapt our learning strategies in unstable environments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the study worked&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, scientists trained mice to respond to a five-second warning cue that predicted an unpleasant outcome. If the mice moved to the other side of a two-chamber box during the warning cue, they could avoid the outcome entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the mice learned the task, researchers recorded dopamine activity in two areas of the nucleus accumbens, a brain region involved in motivation and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research had suggested that dopamine in the ventromedial shell of the nucleus accumbens increases during bad experiences, while dopamine in the core of the nucleus accumbens decreases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the scientists wanted to understand how these different dopamine responses work together when the mice learn to avoid bad experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the two areas of the nucleus accumbens responded differently:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the ventromedial shell, dopamine levels initially surged in response to the unpleasant event itself. As the mice actively learned about the meaning of the warning cue, the dopamine response shifted to the cue itself. Eventually, though, the dopamine response faded away as the mice became skilled at avoiding the outcome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the core, dopamine decreased for both the unpleasant event and the warning cue. The reduction in dopamine in response to the warning cue steadily increased throughout training, especially as the mice became more successful at avoiding the event. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These responses are not only different in their sign — where in one area, dopamine goes up for something bad and, in the other area, it goes down for something bad — but we also saw that one is important for early learning while the other one is important for later-stage learning,” said corresponding author Talia Lerner, associate professor of neuroscience and psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Feinberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, the researchers tested what would happen when the outcome couldn’t be avoided, regardless of the mice’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under those conditions, dopamine patterns returned to what they looked like earlier in training — suggesting that these brain signals are sensitive to context and may help animals adapt their behavior when the environment changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This shows that the dopamine signals are flexible, sensitive to task rules, and may help us adapt to changes in the environment,” Lopez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why a ‘dopamine detox’ is too simplistic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have been singing the praises of the “dopamine detox” wellness trend — cutting out things that trigger a dopamine rush, like eating junk food or scrolling social media, to regain control over these behaviors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this study helps explain why the concept of a “dopamine detox” is too simplistic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think of dopamine as a learning molecule that is important for normal behavior in everyday life,” Lopez said. “So, cutting it out completely can do more harm than good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The dopamine signals we are studying are important for representing aversive signals that are involved in problems like chronic pain, depression and withdrawal from addictive substances,” Lopez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overactive avoidance learning may also be a pathway that contributes to obsessive-compulsive disorder and other clinical anxiety disorders. We hope to follow up on these basic research findings to address clinical problems affecting patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this dopamine and learning research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f29981939f87979e819d9cb29c9d80869a8597818697809cdc979687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kristin Samuelson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://northwestern.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Kristin Samuelson – Northwestern University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.04.006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Region-specific nucleus accumbens dopamine signals encode distinct aspects of avoidance learning&lt;/a&gt;” by Gabriela Lopez et al. &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Region-specific nucleus accumbens dopamine signals encode distinct aspects of avoidance learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoidance learning—learning to avoid bad outcomes—is an essential survival behavior. Dopamine signals are widely observed in response to aversive stimuli, indicating they could play a role in learning about how to avoid these stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is unclear what computations dopamine signals perform to support avoidance learning. Furthermore, substantial heterogeneity in dopamine responses to aversive stimuli has been observed across nucleus accumbens (NAc) subregions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how heterogeneous dopamine responses to aversive stimuli contribute to avoidance learning, we recorded NAc core (Core) and NAc ventromedial shell (vmShell) dopamine during a task in which mice could avoid a footshock punishment by moving to the opposite side of a 2-chamber apparatus during a 5-s warning cue. Both signals evolved substantially—but differently—with learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that Core and vmShell dopamine signals responded oppositely to shocks at the beginning of training and oppositely to warning cues as cue-shock associations developed in mid-training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core dopamine responses strengthen with learning and are especially evident during expert performance. vmShell dopamine responses to cues and shocks were present during early learning but were not sustained during expert performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data support a model in which Core dopamine encodes prediction errors that guide the consolidation of avoidance learning, while vmShell dopamine guides initial cue-shock associations by signaling aversive salience.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 19:10:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9TVEpFLVNFM3ZFd0ZRWC10d2JUdGU3M2VJclg1QVJtRUFjbm5qSlp2NmUtYy1MYkVjbllWMlRjbk9zbGt3VlV2TmQ0R2laa1ZyT0dTVU0yVmtKUGVRLVhkTm5MbmwxSzNFWE9qN1pTdmxBdw</guid></item><item><title>导致湾区流感病例激增的脊髓灰质炎样疾病的病毒- SFGATE | Virus that causes polio-like illness found in Bay Area as influenza cases spike - SFGATE</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxNLUZ5OGhOTkprTHVLTGhMM3BpOEFjazZqTkVHS1MtSXBIQmxKaE0wUGRUUGstMTdUNTU5cXU4NUhlQ1RSZWcyeGxxZHFUcXUtOEpqSTN5STI3R0hHekUtNXdJaGw1QmNVX3puMGQ4THJVaWZITEtTaHF3Qy12QThIaFg1WUZKWHhxSWdLc1ZUT29zc3M?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="rel"&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:-mx40 lg:-mx56 x100vw sm:cw-80 lg:cw-112 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downtown San Jose, Calif. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Steve Proehl/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get your gallon of hand sanitizer out from underneath the kitchen sink, because while COVID-19 levels may be low, a slew of other &lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-bay-area-flu-season-cases-increasing-20159536.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;respiratory illnesses&lt;/a&gt; are riding high in the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to recent data from &lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/?selectedLocation=%7B%22label%22%3A%22San%20Jose,%20CA%22,%22level%22%3A%22plant%22,%22value%22%3A%22c8d357b9%22%7D&amp;amp;plantId=c8d357b9&amp;amp;charts=CjIQACABSABaBkhNUFZfNHIKMjAyNS0wMy0xMXIKMjAyNS0wNC0yMooBBmEwZjcxM8ABAQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;selectedChartId=a0f713&amp;amp;target=HMPV_4" data-link="native" class=""&gt;WastewaterScan&lt;/a&gt;, a Stanford-run program that tracks viral traces in local wastewater, levels of influenza B — a virus that causes similar symptoms as the flu — were prevalent throughout virtually the entire region as of Tuesday morning.

Rates of the illness were particularly high in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26489019/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;U.S. in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in 1,153 infections in 49 states, a 2016 article published in the Journal of Medical Virology article shows. At the time, it was the largest number of infections ever recorded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/about-enterovirus-d68.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;the virus&lt;/a&gt; typically causes mild symptoms that mimic the common cold. Like many respiratory diseases, it’s found in sputum, mucus and contaminated surfaces and can be spread through coughing and sneezing. Though adults are more likely to be asymptomatic, young children — especially those with asthma — could develop a rare polio-like complication called acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM, which can lead to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21669-enterovirus-d68" data-link="native" class=""&gt;temporary or permanent&lt;/a&gt; paralysis. Symptoms include difficulty swallowing, slurred speech and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/about-enterovirus-d68.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;arm or leg weakness&lt;/a&gt;, among several other physical signs. No vaccine is available for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these respiratory illnesses have “come in to fill a vacuum,” Gandhi explains, meaning that more people acquired immunity to COVID-19 but haven’t been exposed to other viruses like influenza as much over the years, making them more susceptible to infection. Levels of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/human-metapneumovirus/about/index.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;human metapneumovirus&lt;/a&gt;, another respiratory illness, are also high in North Bay regions like Marin, Santa Rosa and Napa, wastewater data suggests.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Swartzberg, a clinical professor emeritus at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health, agrees with Gandhi’s explanation. Though the Golden State is faring slightly better than the rest of the U.S., it’s “still seeing a considerable amount of influenza” in particular, he told SFGATE Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-1" data-large-id="Inline-3" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the numbers are low, there’s still a lot of virus circulating and people getting sick,” he said. This viral trend is also right on time: Influenza A begins in the late fall and peaks in January and sometimes even mid-February. When it begins to wane in March and April, influenza B trickles in, he explained. Fortunately, he says, it’s a “blip” compared with the highly mutable influenza A and will likely taper off by next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Swartzberg says it’s difficult to explain why WastewaterScan data is showing that areas like Santa Rosa, Santa Clara and San Jose are struggling with high levels of EV-D68. It spikes every few years, he says, but its epidemiology isn’t fully understood. “Other than that, we know that wastewater tends to portend actual infections that we’re seeing,” he told SFGATE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To protect yourself from these illnesses, Gandhi recommends staying home when you’re sick, staying away from others who are sick, socializing in well-ventilated spaces and getting the flu vaccine.
