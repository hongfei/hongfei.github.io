			&lt;p&gt;One of the finest foods available to humanity may carry an unexpected benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study has found that eating 50 grams (1.76 ounces) or more of high-fat cheese a day correlates with a lower risk of developing dementia. That means all cheeses with more than 20 percent fat content, &lt;a href="https://bcpa.eu/factsheets/FatContentOfCheeses.htm"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; brie, gouda, cheddar, parmesan, gruyere, and mozzarella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extensive, long-term study followed 27,670 adults in Sweden for around 25 years. The findings establish an association between daily consumption of high-fat cheese and lower dementia risk that is statistically detectable – although more research needs to be done to figure out the potential mechanism behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-sleeping-pill-could-reduce-buildup-of-alzheimers-proteins-study-finds"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Common Sleeping Pill Could Reduce Buildup of Alzheimer's Proteins, Study Finds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For decades, the debate over high-fat versus low-fat diets has shaped health advice, sometimes even categorizing cheese as an unhealthy food to limit," &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/home/PressRelease/5304"&gt;says nutrition epidemiologist Emily Sonestedt&lt;/a&gt; of Lund University in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study found that some high-fat dairy products may actually lower the risk of dementia, challenging some long-held assumptions about fat and brain health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is an umbrella term for &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia/types-of-dementia"&gt;several conditions&lt;/a&gt; that impair cognitive function, such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="186017" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease (the most common form), vascular dementia, and dementia that can develop in disorders like &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia/types-of-dementia/parkinson-s-disease-dementia"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt;57 million people&lt;/a&gt; were living with dementia in 2021, and an estimated 10 million new cases are diagnosed every year. A 2019 Global Burden of Disease analysis projected that, by 2050, the number of cases could rise &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s2468-2667(21)00249-8"&gt;as high as 153 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since there's a dearth of effective treatments for dementia, some researchers are focusing their efforts on ways of reducing the chances of developing dementia, with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-study-links-4-healthy-diets-with-up-to-28-lower-dementia-risk"&gt;diet playing a major role&lt;/a&gt; in these &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-diet-helps-lower-dementia-risk-and-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;risk mitigation strategies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The so-called MIND diet – a variation of the Mediterranean diet – has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sticking-to-the-mind-diet-could-reduce-your-risk-of-developing-dementia"&gt;been touted as promising&lt;/a&gt;; however, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13195-022-00957-1"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2023.0800"&gt;different studies&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15010032"&gt;inconsistent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dairy is one particular food group whose association with dementia has been difficult to establish. Studies from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-022-02834-x"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-022-00615-2"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-taste-for-cheese-may-reveal-your-future-risk-of-dementia"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, for example, have looked at different amounts of cheese consumption and found varying results in dementia links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new paper, led by nutrition epidemiologist Yufeng Du of Lund University, researchers set out to clarify these inconsistent findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They based their analysis on the &lt;a href="https://www.malmo-kohorter.lu.se/malmo-diet-cancer-mdc"&gt;Malmö Diet and Cancer cohort&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;a long-running observational study surveying Swedish residents about their diet and tracking health outcomes&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span&gt;Of the 27,670 participants, 3,208 developed dementia over the course of about 25 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants recorded their diet at baseline using a 7-day food diary, a food-frequency questionnaire, and a detailed interview about food preparation and eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="docos-replyview-body docos-anchoredreplyview-body docos-replyview-body-emoji-reactable docos-replyview-body-emoji-reactable-background" dir="ltr"&gt;The researchers compared people's dementia risk based on their cheese intake. Around 10 percent of those who ate 50 grams or more of high-fat cheese per day developed dementia, compared to about 13 percent of people who ate less than 15 grams a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, sex, education, and overall diet, people who ate more than 50 grams of high-fat cheese per day had a 13 percent lower all-cause dementia risk compared to people who ate less than 15 grams per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No such association appeared for low-fat cheese or cream, any kind of milk, or fermented milk products such as yogurt and kefir. Butter showed mixed results, including a possible increased Alzheimer's risk at high intake compared to people eating no butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before you chow down on cheese with abandon, other researchers point out important issues with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"One of the biggest limitations of this study is the cheese consumption as recorded from a food diary and interview at one time point 25 years before the analysis of dementia diagnosis. It is highly likely that diet and other lifestyle factors changed in those 25 years," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-looking-at-the-association-between-eating-high-fat-cheese-and-cream-and-dementia-risk/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Tara Spires-Jones, Division Lead in the UK Dementia Research Institute, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As nice as it would be, it may not be wise to pin your hopes on any one food to protect yourself against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214343"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Neurology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The time to get vaccinated for this season is now,” Timothy Uyeki, the chief medical officer of the influenza division at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said in a call with clinicians last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The message comes amid diminishing access to and flourishing rumors about vaccines under Robert F Kennedy Jr, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, who has made &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/health/rfk-jr-vaccines-autism-video.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;false claims&lt;/a&gt; about the ineffectiveness of flu vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/06/vaccine-panel-hepatitis-b-change" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;overseen limitations&lt;/a&gt; on routine vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After a year of dramatic cuts to staff and programs at health agencies, CDC officials highlighted the need to continue monitoring variants such as the H3N2 virus subclade K – currently the top strain in the US – as flu season unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s hard to say what will happen throughout the season, and that’s why we need surveillance to really track this,” Uyeki said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A child died of the flu in the week ending 22 November, marking the first known pediatric death this season, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-49.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC also reported another child death from flu during last year’s season, bringing the total to 288 – the deadliest pediatric flu season on record outside of a pandemic. Last year, there were an estimated 610,000 to 1.3 million hospitalizations from influenza in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Last season, by all indicators, was a high severity season and one of the highest we have experienced in the US,” Uyeki said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Officials at the CDC on last week’s call highlighted changes in vaccine policy – including a new recommendation against thimerosal, a preservative also known as thiomersal, previously used in a small percentage of flu vaccines. The CDC’s vaccine advisers voted to recommend only flu vaccines without the preservative in a June meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The top regulators of vaccines and drugs at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also recently announced changes to how flu vaccines will be approved, which may include &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/fda-vaccine-regulations-unconfirmed-covid-deaths" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;extensive trials&lt;/a&gt; each year for children and pregnant people that would put annual vaccination &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/04/us-vaccines-vinay-prasad-memo" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;out of reach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Children, pregnant people, immune-compromised people, and the elderly are among those at highest risk of illness and death. Vaccines protect against severe complications like pneumonia, cardiac complications, neurological issues, and encephalopathy, or brain dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There were 109 cases of encephalopathy among children last year, with 74% needing intensive care and 54% needing mechanical ventilators. Most (55%) of the children with encephalopathy had no underlying conditions – except for not being vaccinated. Only 16% of the children who were eligible had gotten vaccinated. Nearly one in five (19%) of the children with encephalopathy died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The majority of these are preventable, and this is really, really tragic,” said Uyeki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is the highest number of deaths for a seasonal influenza epidemic since we’ve been keeping track, and clearly highlights the fact that we need to do a much better job of preventing influenza and preventing influenza-associated death in children in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last year, the vaccine was 63% to 78% &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing hospitalization among children and 41% to 55% effective against hospitalization among adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In August, the CDC identified the new variant (H3N2 virus subclade K), which mutated from the version of H3N2 included in the vaccine – raising concerns that the flu vaccine might be less effective this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;index&amp;quot;:16,&amp;quot;listId&amp;quot;:4152,&amp;quot;identityName&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;today-us&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Headlines US&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;frequency&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Every day&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;We'll send you The Guardian Headlines US every day&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;news&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idApiUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As the flu season in the US is only beginning now, there is too little data so far to calculate how effective the vaccine is against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s too early to know what impact exactly this new subclade will have on the influenza vaccine effectiveness for this season,” said Lisa Grohskopf, also a medical officer in the CDC’s influenza division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It takes a little while before accumulating enough activity and specimens to be able to calculate [vaccine effectiveness].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Based on early numbers from the United Kingdom, which had an early start to the flu season, vaccine effectiveness is about 70 to 75% for children and 30 to 40% for adults – similar to prior vaccine efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The evidence indicates that “influenza vaccination remains an effective tool in preventing influenza-associated hospitalizations for the season”, Grohskopf said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The flu vaccine is recommended for everyone six months and up, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Providers have been &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/11/pediatricians-vaccines-flu-season" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommending FluMist more&lt;/a&gt; to patients who are eligible. It’s not a shot, which may assuage vaccine hesitancy. And it may now be given at home by a caregiver or the patient after a major change from the FDA in September 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;​​Antivirals are also a safe and effective way to treat and prevent severe illness, including in pregnancy, and they work best the sooner they can be started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In recent years, flu antiviral prescriptions have dropped, Uyeki said. Only 35% of children at high risk are prescribed antivirals, and only 32% of children who visited emergency departments because of flu were prescribed antivirals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 12:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5XYjFjM1J0WUxCVWZZcXI3d05pbGRXVzZIUU1wakNYd3pzOWNrNVBoaFFXLWZLdkRXdk9FUjJudG4tMXJ4cHJEQTNDY1VlM3JUbnVsVkdUQm9RVERzak9Hc2Q2TzZKUzJIOUFHVV9mWjJkWl91NkE</guid></item><item><title>尝试治疗喉咙痛的7种家庭疗法-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/12/18/sore-throat-home-remedies/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N52IDJ4S7RDVJOHY2YI3DAAQGU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Woke up to a sore, scratchy throat?

In this study though, the researchers identified six specific symptoms that may act as warning flags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings show that dementia risk is linked to a handful of depressive symptoms rather than depression as a whole," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/dec/specific-depressive-symptoms-midlife-linked-increased-dementia-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiological psychologist Philipp Frank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This symptom-level approach gives us a much clearer picture of who may be more vulnerable decades before dementia develops."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/laughing-gas-can-offer-immediate-relief-from-depression-study-finds"&gt;Laughing Gas Can Offer Immediate Relief From Depression, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data for 5,811 individuals taking part in a longitudinal study in the UK. Information on patients' mental health was collected between 1997 and 1999, when the participants were aged between 45 and 69 and all dementia free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health of these volunteers was then tracked for around two decades afterwards, on average. Dementia diagnoses &lt;span&gt;recorded in UK health records and registries &lt;/span&gt;up to 2023 were used in the final results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over that time, 10.1 percent of the participants developed dementia – and those who reported five or more symptoms of depression in middle age were found to have a 27 percent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-roots-of-dementia-trace-back-all-the-way-to-childhood-experts-find"&gt;higher risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this risk increase was driven by six specific depressive symptoms, out of 30 assessed in total.

(Frank et al., &lt;em&gt;Lancet Psychiat.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss of self-confidence and not being able to deal with problems were particularly significant, with each increasing dementia risk by around 50 percent. Some symptoms, such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/poor-sleep-can-trigger-a-vicious-cycle-your-brain-cant-break-experts-warn"&gt;sleep problems&lt;/a&gt; and suicidal ideation, showed no long-term correlation with dementia diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the structure of the study doesn't show direct cause and effect, it suggests that certain elements of depression are associated with a higher chance of developing dementia – which may in turn inform research into &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-study-links-15-factors-to-early-dementia-risk"&gt;why dementia takes hold&lt;/a&gt; of some brains but not others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyday symptoms that many people experience in midlife appear to carry important information about long-term brain health," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/dec/specific-depressive-symptoms-midlife-linked-increased-dementia-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Frank. "Paying attention to these patterns could open new opportunities for early prevention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that both &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-antidepressants-could-speed-decline-in-dementia-patients"&gt;depression and dementia&lt;/a&gt; are complex and multi-faceted, and different between individuals. That makes trying to establish &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/dad2.70036"&gt;connections&lt;/a&gt; between them challenging – but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.5711"&gt;not impossible&lt;/a&gt;, as this study shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, there's no guarantee that these results apply universally. The team acknowledges that the research was conducted only in the UK, using relatively healthy civil servants. Dementia was found to be less common in participants in the longitudinal study, compared to the general UK population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed in more diverse cohorts, especially with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(21)00249-8"&gt;dementia expected&lt;/a&gt; to become more prevalent as the growing global population gets older. But it could give scientists a place to start at least, and if a proportion of those cases can be prevented, it could make a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Depression doesn't have a single shape – symptoms vary widely and often overlap with anxiety," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/dec/specific-depressive-symptoms-midlife-linked-increased-dementia-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Mika Kivimäki. "We found that these nuanced patterns can reveal who is at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-4-key-factors-that-may-predict-cognitive-decline"&gt;higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing neurological disorders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This brings us closer to more personalized and effective mental health treatments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(25)00331-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

need another reason to visit the gym this winter, a new study of almost 1,200 healthy, middle-aged men and women found that those with more muscle mass tended to have younger brains than those with less muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;The findings, which were presented in Chicago this month at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America, add to growing evidence that building and maintaining muscle mass as we age could be key to building and maintaining brain health, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;The researchers also found that those with high levels of deep belly fat had older brains, raising&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;questions about the potentially negative effects of some types of body fat on the brain and how important it may be to combine weight training with weight loss, if we would like our brains to stay youthful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;Why exercise is good for brains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;The idea that exercise is good for our brains is hardly new. Past studies in rodents have shown that after exercise, the animals’ brains teem with a neurochemical called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF. Sometimes referred to as “Miracle-Gro for the brain,” BDNF helps spark the creation of new neurons. So it’s not surprising that after exercise, mouse and rat brains typically sprout two or three times as many new brain cells as the brains of sedentary animals. The exercising animals also ace rodent intelligence tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;People who exercise also show large increases in BDNF in their bloodstreams afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;Other studies have shown that as few as 25 minutes a week of walking, cycling, swimming or similar exercise can be strongly linked to greater brain volume in older people, while taking as few as 3,000 steps a day helps slow cognitive decline in people at high risk for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;But most of this research involved aerobic exercise and the brain effects of endurance. Fewer studies have looked at the role of muscle mass. Many questions also remain about the role of body fat on brain health, especially the deep, interior fat around our bellies known as visceral fat, which can increase inflammation throughout the body, including, potentially, in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;Is your brain young or old?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;For the new study, scientists at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and other institutions decided to look deep inside people’s body tissues and brains with magnetic resonance imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;They turned to existing whole-body scans of 1,164 healthy men and women in their 40s, 50s or early 60s. “To understand dementia risk, we’ve got to focus on midlife,” said Cyrus Raji, an associate professor of radiology and neurology at Washington University School of Medicine and the study’s senior author. It’s in middle age that we typically start to develop - or avoid - most of the common risk factors for later dementia, he said, making it a critical time period to study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;The scientists used artificial intelligence to analyze the scans and determine people’s total muscle mass and body fat. The body fat was characterized as either visceral or subcutaneous, a different type of fat found just beneath our skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;The researchers figured out the apparent age of people’s brains using algorithms based on scans of tens of thousands of other brains. These provided benchmarks of typical brain structure and volume for someone of any age. People’s brains could either match the benchmarks for their chronological age, or look like those of people younger or older. Older-looking brains face heightened risks for early cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;More muscle means younger brains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;The researchers found that the amounts of people’s muscle mass and their visceral fat were both strongly linked to their apparent brain age, though in opposing ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;“The larger the muscle bulk, the younger-looking the brain,” Raji said. “And the more visceral fat that was present, the older-looking the brain.” People whose ratio of visceral fat to muscle mass was especially high - meaning they had a relatively large level of visceral fat and low muscle mass - tended to have the oldest-looking brains. (Subcutaneous fat was not linked to brain age in any way.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;The study didn’t look at how muscle and fat affect brains, but both tissues release a variety of biochemicals that can travel to the brain and jump-start various processes there, Raji said. The substances from muscles tend to promote the creation and integration of brain cells and neuronal connections; those from visceral fat do the reverse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;On a practical level, the findings underscore that resistance exercise “is super important” for healthy brain aging, Raji said. Most of us begin losing muscle mass in middle age, but strength training can slow or even reverse that decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;Shedding visceral fat is likewise a good idea for our brains, he said. Both aerobic and resistance exercise will target visceral fat. Using weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and other GLP-1 drugs can also substantially reduce visceral fat. But many people taking the drugs will drop muscle mass, Raji said - unless they also lift weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;The study has limitations. It hasn’t been published or peer-reviewed. Because it’s not an experiment, it also can’t show that more muscle and less belly fat cause brains to age more slowly - only that those conditions are all linked to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;But its findings are plausible and align with those of a growing number of other studies, said Fang Yu, director of the Roybal Center for Older Adults Living Alone with Cognitive Decline at Arizona State University in Phoenix. She studies exercise and aging but was not involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph sans-serif"&gt;Essentially, the study’s message is simple, actionable and even rhymes: If you want a younger, healthier brain, Raji said, “strength train.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Anchorage Daily News</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 00:45:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQdlJ1QWFySDJDT1I3cFJvNFhWb19qSEhTbmxtU1lfSWNLR3pBcm1zSDhleW1ITWNOMk1YRkwyLUNPTzNtQWV5cHVLNkRHSm9LRFlXNGlIc3phQWlyMzBSRTZvcWptN1EwZnkzLW1ZZUowTTdCZDV1cndWZGNrUS1WeDM2aS1UMUU4VEtKd2NwSk1jbTU3VERBY0tBM2xXWHg3UW1XUF9LQVp2NHlMa1pXQmV3</guid></item><item><title>随着犹他州、亚利桑那州和南卡罗来纳州病例增加，麻疹疫情不会在2025年结束- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreaks-no-end-2025-cases-mount-utah-arizona-south-carolina-rcna249743</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9c34e1" class="body-graf"&gt;As measles &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-south-carolina-quarantine-utah-arizona-us-rcna248435" target="_blank"&gt;continues to spread&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, it’s likely that the outbreaks that broke records in 2025 will continue into the new year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f8d56a" class="body-graf"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/2025-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, 168 people, mostly schoolchildren, are in quarantine. Most of the state's 138 cases confirmed since September, nearly all in unvaccinated people, have been centered in Spartanburg County in the northwestern part of the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a7d103" class="body-graf"&gt;“As we identify new cases, and if those cases have susceptible contacts, that’s a new 21-day quarantine period,” Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist for the state Department of Public Health, said Wednesday at what has become a weekly news briefing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a972cb" class="body-graf"&gt;That is, anyone who is unvaccinated and therefore vulnerable to measles exposures occurring now will be in quarantine through the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-811cd8" class="body-graf"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/map-kindergartner-vaccination-rates-are-lowest-rcna229455" target="_blank"&gt;NBC News data&lt;/a&gt;, the K-12 vaccination rate for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) in Spartanburg County was 90% for the 2024-25 school year, below the 95% level doctors say is needed to protect against an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7ec4f1" class="body-graf"&gt;Bell said the vaccination rate has been falling for several years, similar to other areas in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e6eb6e" class="body-graf"&gt;Based on NBC News' investigation, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/vaccine-divide/" target="_blank"&gt;The Vaccine Divide&lt;/a&gt;, in the states collecting data for the MMR vaccine, 67% of counties and jurisdictions have immunization rates below 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-538117" class="body-graf"&gt;Bell said at the briefing that there was no indication the South Carolina outbreak was spreading yet to nearby states, such as North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-099f9c" class="body-graf"&gt;Since the latest surge in cases, which began in late summer in the &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" target="_blank"&gt;bordering areas of southwestern Utah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;Arizona &lt;/a&gt;and, more recently, in South Carolina, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has taken a low profile, with nearly all public outreach about the nationwide outbreaks coming from local and state health departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5d6f3c" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s a stark contrast to how the agency has previously communicated about infectious diseases like measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-301ca0" class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41380254/" target="_blank"&gt;study published last week&lt;/a&gt; uncovered an “emerging health communication void” regarding measles and measles vaccines in the CDC’s social media accounts. The agency posted about measles 10 times on its social media channels from January through August, according to the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-722a8b" class="body-graf"&gt;During the same period from 2021 to 2024, the CDC posted an average of about 46 times each year, the study found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-edfaa8" class="body-graf"&gt;Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services (which oversees the CDC), said in an email that the “CDC has developed and distributed updated communication materials, including multilingual resources, to help communities respond to ongoing outbreaks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4d09b5" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC sends teams to investigate infectious disease hot spots only if states request it. Bell said the South Carolina Public Health Department hasn’t asked for extra help from the agency to contain the outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-feeb7d" class="body-graf"&gt;Separately, the measles outbreak largely straddling the border between Arizona and Utah also continues to swell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-28ad09" class="body-graf"&gt;The Utah Department of Health and Human Services reports 125 cases, with 21 diagnosed just in the last three weeks. According to the health department, there were multiple measles exposures last week in the southwestern part of the state, including at an elementary school, an urgent care facility, a pediatrician’s office and a pediatric dentistry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-60d3e0" class="body-graf"&gt;The Arizona Department of Health Services reports 190 cases, nearly all in Mohave County, which borders Utah. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c55398" class="body-graf"&gt;Nearly all of those cases, 97%, occurred among people who weren’t vaccinated against the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d59ec5" class="body-graf"&gt;As of Wednesday, the United States had logged 1,958 measles cases in 2025, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;latest update from the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. That’s just 168 cases shy of a previous high of 2,216 recorded in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-88ec0b" class="body-graf"&gt;There have been 49 outbreaks (defined as three or more related cases) reported in 2025. In 2025, 222 people, 11% of the 1,958 cases, were sick enough to be hospitalized, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b15134" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Three people, an adult in New Mexico and two young girls in Texas, have died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 00:41:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxOb1ZIWjZ0UUM2Z3lvUnV3a00ya0JESEtaYnMzRmR6VmU3Z0xQTnlnRTBaR3pvNWl6UEhzLW1zcl9fV2VseDhHTEZpZXdXRFd1cFVGSlpLb1dOY0ZSQlh3NS1HcEpqSzdmLTVCM3hVWm5LclBjZXJhZnh4ZTdXV3lDSGNRU0tQUFBOZGhfaHVqRC14VnVMTUtFY1pSbzZxeFpQRFMtQjMyQndDM2FodUFjNnlGZkJXTmM2Wm50RmkwblM</guid></item><item><title>每年12月“提前到来”有一个科学原因- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-a-scientific-reason-december-arrives-sooner-every-year</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;How is it December already? What happened to 2025? And how did we suddenly jump from eating Easter eggs to putting up Christmas trees?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why our perception of time seems to bend and warp, we need to dig into how our brains tell time in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term "&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/ive-researched-time-for-15-years-heres-how-my-perception-of-it-has-changed-215499"&gt;time perception&lt;/a&gt;" is actually a bit of a misnomer, because time itself isn't "out there" to be perceived.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brain-goes-through-5-distinct-epochs-massive-study-finds"&gt;Your Brain Goes Through 5 Distinct Epochs, Massive Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we perceive a colour, a sound, a flavour or a touch, specialised sensory organs detect something in the environment: the wavelength of a light particle that enters the eye, the frequency of a sound wave that enters the ear, the presence of different chemicals in the mouth and nose, or the pressure of an object against our skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is no parallel for time – no "time particle" for the brain to detect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How brains deal with time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our brains don't perceive time – they infer it. Like the ticking of a clock, the brain estimates the passage of time by keeping track of change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But unlike a clock, the brain does not have regular ticks to count. To infer how much time has passed, the brain simply adds up how much happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you fill a time interval with exciting stuff, it seems to last longer. In the lab, a briefly presented flickering image &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1167/6.12.8"&gt;seems to last longer&lt;/a&gt; than a static image of the same duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/707641/original/file-20251210-64-curvv5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;rect=0%2C0%2C6000%2C4000&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Brains estimate time by keeping track of change. (&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/night-city-traffic-motion-blur-with-officer-35081258/"&gt;Jean-Guillaume Starnini/Pexels&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also why witnesses of highly intense events (such as car accidents) frequently report that time seems to slow down. Indeed, in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0001295"&gt;one well-known study&lt;/a&gt;, research participants fell backwards into a net from a height of more than 30 metres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they were subsequently asked to estimate the duration of their terrifying experience, they reported durations more than a third longer than when they judged someone else's fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intense arousal of the first-hand experience amplifies attention, in turn causing the brain to store dense, rich memories of events as they unfold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, when it needs to estimate how much time passed during the event, this unusually dense recollection of unfolding events causes the brain to overestimate how much time passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Time… flies?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand what happened to November and the rest of 2025, we also need to distinguish between telling time retrospectively (how much time has passed) versus prospectively (how fast time is passing now).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As every child knows, time spent waiting at the dentist passes much more slowly than time spent playing with a new toy. But why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, a key part of the story is how much is happening – and, specifically, what you're paying attention to. The more you pay attention to time itself, the more slowly it seems to pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The old adage states that time flies when you're having fun, but it doesn't necessarily need to be fun. Whatever you're attending to just needs to distract you from the passage of time. Keep your mind engaged, whether it's work or play, and time will slip away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But try staring at a clock for even five minutes, and you will feel how endless that seems, unless you let your mind wander. Boredom slows time right down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Routine makes the years fly by&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This disconnect between prospective and retrospective time perception also explains the saying "&lt;a href="https://gretchenrubin.com/articles/secret-of-adulthood-the-days-are-long-but-the-years-are-short/"&gt;the days are long but the years are short&lt;/a&gt;", a phenomenon that tends to increase as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we are young, lots of things are new: we go to school for the first time, enter a first relationship, start our first job. All these novel events form a rich store of memories that the brain later looks back on to conclude that a lot has happened, so a lot of time must have passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, when we get older, a lot of our daily tasks become more routine: bring the kids to school, go to work, cook dinner. As some previously novel parts of our day become routine, they become less interesting. Boring jobs cause time to slow down, creating the impression that the days crawl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-hidden-brain-state-before-sleep-may-be-the-key-to-human-genius"&gt;A Hidden Brain State Before Sleep May Be The Key to Human Genius&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically though, because these routine tasks are less exciting and novel, they leave weaker and less vivid memory traces. When our older brain therefore looks back to infer how much time has passed since the start of the year, it concludes that not much has happened, so it doesn't feel very long ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is at odds with our conscious knowledge that it's already December, and we are left wondering how the year flew by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do I slow down time, then?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slowing down time &lt;em&gt;as you're experiencing&lt;/em&gt; it is very easy, although completely dissatisfying: just get bored. Go wait at red traffic lights. Count to ten thousand in your head. Watch paint dry, as they say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, slowing down &lt;em&gt;retrospective&lt;/em&gt; time is a little more difficult. Essentially, you need to make sure that come December, you have a year's worth of memories to show for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to do this is to prevent memories from fading, and the best way to do that is to rehash them. &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-01-29/how-to-stick-to-regular-journalling/100777232"&gt;Write things down&lt;/a&gt; in a diary or journal. Look back and reminisce. Keep your memories alive, and you'll keep your past alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other way to ensure you've got a year's worth of memories at year's end takes a little more initiative, but is a lot more inspiring. Because the best way to prevent the year from feeling like it flew by, is to fill it with lots of exciting memories of new, unique experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So explore. Go adventuring. Do something crazy – something you'll never forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your internal clock will thank you for it.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268982/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

He was 26, and had moved to Bristol a year earlier to start a "dream job" in the race cycling industry. So far, he had struggled to make friends.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I wasn't alone all the time, but […] I was a bit of an outsider," he remembers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;As he headed home, the streets were full of Halloween partygoers in monster and cat costumes. "I walked past people turning up to friend's houses, people running into shops to buy beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"All the pubs were full. It just [felt] like a different world that you're not part of. And you feel like you can never be part of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;That night, he felt like the only person experiencing serious loneliness. In fact, it is becoming a defining feature of his generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Conversations around social isolation tend to focus on the elderly, especially around Christmas. But by some measures, people in their 20s are the loneliest group in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/29cd/live/f4cc9130-d9c4-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/29cd/live/f4cc9130-d9c4-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/29cd/live/f4cc9130-d9c4-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/29cd/live/f4cc9130-d9c4-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/29cd/live/f4cc9130-d9c4-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/29cd/live/f4cc9130-d9c4-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/29cd/live/f4cc9130-d9c4-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/29cd/live/f4cc9130-d9c4-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Adam Becket Left: an image of Adam Becket on a walk.

But analysts say that in most research, young adults shine through as a particularly isolated group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Adults between 18 and 24 are the most lonely - followed by older people," says Prof Andrea Wigfield, director of the Centre for Loneliness Studies at Sheffield Hallam University. "It's a growing problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But why has this happened - and is there a solution?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;The problem of 'scattering'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Increasingly, experts say the modern world is to blame. Many twenty-somethings live in house-shares where they do not know or like their housemates. Work increasingly is done from home and friends are often spoken to on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It is not all bleak. Thanks to the internet, young adults enjoy access to friendships from all over the world. But broadly speaking, experts say, the image of gregarious twenty-something life presented in sitcoms like Friends needs urgent correction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/aca8/live/71c080a0-d9b3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/aca8/live/71c080a0-d9b3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aca8/live/71c080a0-d9b3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/aca8/live/71c080a0-d9b3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/aca8/live/71c080a0-d9b3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/aca8/live/71c080a0-d9b3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/aca8/live/71c080a0-d9b3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aca8/live/71c080a0-d9b3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="NBC Universal via Getty Images A still from the show Friends, with characters standing around in an apartment" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;NBC Universal via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;The 1990s sitcom 'Friends' paints a sociable picture of life for twenty-somethings - but according to young adults who have spoken to the BBC, along with academics, charity bosses and doctors, the 20s is a primary decade of loneliness&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We tend to romanticise young adulthood as a carefree time - when it's usually the most miserable time in people's lives," says Prof Richard Weissbourd, a lecturer in education at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In some ways, early adulthood has always been a time of instability. Young adults tend to leave their childhood home and move around. Friends depart, and family ties weaken. These transitory life events can, for some, lead to intense loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"A big problem is the scattering - everybody you ever knew now lives in a million different places," says Dr Meg Jay, a clinical psychologist and author of The Twenty-Something Treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This "scattering" proved difficult for Adam Becket. He had a rich social life when he lived in London in his early 20s - but after moving to Bristol, he had to make friends from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Not only did I not know anyone, I didn't know where to start meeting people either. You can't just go up to someone and be like, 'Can I join in this fun?' It's easy to spiral into self-doubt and self-flagellation - 'I'm clearly not interesting or cool, or the right kind of person.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Things improved when he joined running and cycling clubs and met people that he "clicked with" - though he says his loneliness still comes and goes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;The Bowling Alone thesis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Today, there is also a set of new, distinctly modern factors that could be making the problem worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In many parts of the world, people are getting married and having children later (or not at all). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The average age of first marriage in the UK is now 31, according to the ONS, up from 1970 when it was 23 for men and 21 for women. Young adults tend to be more reliant on friends for emotional connection - and if those friends don't deliver, loneliness can follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Weissbourd points to a broader fragmenting of communities too. In rich countries, membership of civic institutions - like churches, community groups, or trade unions - has dropped since the 1970s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This is sometimes known as the Bowling Alone thesis, named after an influential 1995 essay by political scientist Robert Putnam, who observed that more young Americans were bowling on their own rather than in teams, a symbol of a wider collapse of social relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Twenty-somethings - who might have left their childhood home but not yet started their own family - can feel that decline of community most sharply, says Prof Weissbourd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We live in an increasingly individualistic society. I think loneliness is a symptom of our failure to care for each other."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7577/live/1e8da770-d9c5-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7577/live/1e8da770-d9c5-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7577/live/1e8da770-d9c5-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7577/live/1e8da770-d9c5-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7577/live/1e8da770-d9c5-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7577/live/1e8da770-d9c5-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7577/live/1e8da770-d9c5-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7577/live/1e8da770-d9c5-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A black and white image of young men and women bowling." class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;In the 1950s young Americans mostly bowled in teams; by the 1990s, more people bowled alone - a trend highlighted by Robert Putnam's famous essay&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This resonates with Zeyneb, 23, who lives alone in Cheltenham. Her own feelings of loneliness peaked last year during her master's degree. With only a few hours of teaching each week, she struggled to find meaningful connections with her classmates. And with her family far away in Romania, she now spends much of her time alone while she looks for a job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It does feel cripplingly lonely when everyone has their own thing to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She craves what psychologists call a "third place": a social setting like a park or library that is different from your "first place" (home) or your "second place" (work or university). "We don't really have that space to meet people," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The closest thing she can think of is her gym - but virtually everyone there wears headphones, she tells me, and few make eye contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;The urban houseshare paradox&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Then there is the post-pandemic rise in working from home. Though young adults in the UK don't work from home as often as older generations - 28% of 16-to-29-year-olds worked from home at least some of the time in the first quarter of 2025, compared with 54% of 30-to-49-year-olds, one study suggests - remote work can hit people in their 20s particularly hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Work from home has been, in my opinion, a nightmare for twenty-somethings," says Dr Jay. "It's really hard to make friends when you don't leave the house."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Nor do shared living situations always help. There is something of a paradox here, as young adults are the most likely to live with other people. (In England and Wales only 5% of people in their early 20s live alone, versus 49% of over-85s, suggests the ONS.) But living under the same roof as others doesn't always seem to make young adults any less lonely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Some of my most pitiful memories of my 20s were being stuck living with people that I didn't like," recalls Dr Jay. "If I was having a hard time, they didn't care, they were too wrapped up in themselves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Of course this isn't the case for all house-shares - but she thinks having an emotionally distant flatmate can make people "even more lonely" than if they lived alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;'Compare and despair' on smartphones&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;All of this is complicated by smartphones and social media. This year, the average British 18-to-24-year-old spent six hours and 20 minutes online every day, according to the media regulator Ofcom, higher than other adult age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some might assume that apps like Instagram and Snapchat contribute to feelings of loneliness because they encourage people to speak online rather than in person - but the data doesn't cleanly support this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;What is certainly true, say some experts, is that social media &lt;i id="amplifies" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;amplifies&lt;/i&gt; pre-existing feelings of loneliness because of what Dr Jay calls the "compare and despair" factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"You feel like, 'Everybody seems to have best friends and they're all skydiving in Dubai - what's wrong with me, I didn't see anyone all weekend.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e514/live/d5e626a0-d9ba-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e514/live/d5e626a0-d9ba-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e514/live/d5e626a0-d9ba-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e514/live/d5e626a0-d9ba-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e514/live/d5e626a0-d9ba-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e514/live/d5e626a0-d9ba-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e514/live/d5e626a0-d9ba-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e514/live/d5e626a0-d9ba-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Four men stand in a queue, looking at their smartphones." class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;The average young adult in the UK spends 6 hours and 20 minutes online every day, according to media regulator Ofcom&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Yet it is also possible that reporting biases are playing a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Studies about loneliness are mostly based on self-report surveys (meaning people are simply asked whether they feel lonely). And Prof Weissbourd says it is plausible that young adults, who tend to be more fluent in the language of mental health and therapy, are more likely than older people to describe themselves as lonely in surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He thinks reporting biases may explain a "piece" of the puzzle - but certainly not all of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Wigfield also thinks the high level of young-adult loneliness is a real phenomenon, not a statistical mirage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;The 'lottery' of social prescribing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;At first, David Gradon's story was fairly typical. In his late 20s, his friends moved away from London. "My social circle really shrunk," he remembers - and he developed symptoms of depression. It was an NHS counsellor who suggested this could be loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He tried meeting people over dating apps (a "terrible" idea) and joined a tag rugby club, but injured his leg in the first session. Increasingly despondent, he organised a park walk on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One autumn day in 2021, Mr Gradon and 11 strangers met at Hampstead Heath in north London. He organised more walks and in time this became his full-time job. He now runs The Great Friendship Project, a non-profit group to combat young adult loneliness, which runs social events for under-35s across London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Everyone's in that same boat. And actually, that brings down barriers. Because you know you're not going to be judged," he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7336/live/bc1d8fc0-d9b4-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7336/live/bc1d8fc0-d9b4-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7336/live/bc1d8fc0-d9b4-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7336/live/bc1d8fc0-d9b4-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7336/live/bc1d8fc0-d9b4-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7336/live/bc1d8fc0-d9b4-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7336/live/bc1d8fc0-d9b4-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7336/live/bc1d8fc0-d9b4-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="The Great Friendship Project A group of people stand in a park, some of them wearing dinosaur costumes." class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;The Great Friendship Project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;David Gradon's non-profit group organises park walks and other events for under-35s in London&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Council-funded youth clubs operate around the country. Most are currently aimed at teenagers and children, but Laura Cunliffe-Hall, head of policy at charity UK Youth, wants to see more clubs for people in their early 20s. She argues that youth work should serve everyone up to the age of 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Funding, she says, is the barrier. Local authority spending on youth services in England fell by 73% between 2010/11 and 2023/24, according to the charity YMCA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some argue that spending money on friendship services can save money over the long term, because the health consequences of long-term loneliness can be severe. Prof Wigfield says that chronic loneliness is linked to inflammation, and can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and dementia in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In recent years the NHS has invested in "social prescribing", where GPs connect patients with certain mental health problems to charity-run services in their area - like art classes or gardening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;More than one million people (of all ages) were referred to NHS social prescribing services in 2023, a recent study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But Prof Wigfield says infrastructure remains patchy. "It really is a lottery in terms of where you live [and] whether the GP has knowledge of local services."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/85db/live/ad0b3960-d9b4-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/85db/live/ad0b3960-d9b4-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/85db/live/ad0b3960-d9b4-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/85db/live/ad0b3960-d9b4-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/85db/live/ad0b3960-d9b4-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/85db/live/ad0b3960-d9b4-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/85db/live/ad0b3960-d9b4-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/85db/live/ad0b3960-d9b4-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="The Great Friendship Project People walking through a London park" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;The Great Friendship Project&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Virtually all attendees come alone, meaning everyone's "in the same boat", says David Gradon of The Great Friendship Project&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Looking ahead to the next decade, Dr Jay sees signs of hope. For one, she thinks working from home has "lost some of its lustre" among twenty-somethings. (Several large employers - including Barclays and WPP - asked staff to spend longer in the office this year.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Jay also notes that some high-profile people are turning against social media - though she says there is not yet much evidence of a significant fall in usage among young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I'd love to see more of a backlash against [social media], but it's just so in our pockets," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Then there are those who find their solution to loneliness in unexpected places. For Zeyneb, the best antidote to social isolation was adopting a black cat, Olive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"She's quite cuddly," says Zeyneb.

From 2003 to August 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) has &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.paho.org/en/documents/epidemiological-update-avian-influenza-ah5n1-americas-region-15-october-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 990 human H5N1 cases across 25 countries, including 475 deaths - a 48% fatality rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In the US alone, the virus has struck more than 180 million birds, spread to over 1,000 dairy herds in 18 states, and infected at least 70 people - mostly farmworkers - causing several hospitalisations and one death. In January, three tigers and a leopard died at a wildlife rescue centre in India's Nagpur city from the virus that typically infects birds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Symptoms in humans mimic a severe flu: high fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches and, at times, conjunctivitis. Some people have no symptoms at all. The risk to humans remains low, but authorities are watching H5N1 closely for any shift that could make it spread more easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;That concern is what prompted new peer-reviewed modelling by Indian researchers Philip Cherian and Gautam Menon of Ashoka University, which simulates how an H5N1 outbreak might unfold in humans and what early interventions could stop it before it spreads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In other words, the&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12889-025-25358-5" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt; model &lt;/a&gt;published in the BMC Public Health journal uses real world data and computer simulations to play out how an outbreak might spread in real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"The threat of an H5N1 pandemic in humans is a genuine one, but we can hope to forestall it through better surveillance and a more nimble public-health response," Prof Menon told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A bird flu pandemic, researchers say, would begin quietly: a single infected bird passing the virus to a human - most likely a farmer, market worker or someone handling poultry. From there, the danger lies not in that first infection but in what happens next: sustained human-to-human transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Because real outbreaks start with limited, messy data, the researchers turned to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bharatsim.ashoka.edu.in/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;BharatSim&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source simulation platform originally built for Covid 19 modelling, but versatile enough to study other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Hindustan Times via Getty Images A worker at National Zoological Park sprays pesticides at the entrance gate to sanitize the premises as bird flu spread in the zoo area on 1 September, 2025 in New Delhi, India.

Secondary contacts are those who have not met the infected person but have been in close contact with a primary contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If households of primary contacts are quarantined when just two cases are detected, the outbreak can almost certainly be contained, the research found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But by the time 10 cases are identified, it is overwhelmingly likely that the infection has already spread into the wider population, making its trajectory virtually indistinguishable from a scenario with no early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;To keep the study grounded in real-world conditions, the researchers chose a model of a single village in Namakkal district, Tamil Nadu - the heart of India's poultry belt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Namakkal is home to more than 1,600 poultry farms and some 70 million chickens; it produces over 60 million eggs a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A village of 9,667 residents was generated using a synthetic community - households, workplaces, market spaces - and seeded with infected birds to mimic real-life exposure. (A synthetic community is an artificial, computer-generated population that mimics the characteristics and behaviours of a real population.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In the simulation, the virus starts at one workplace -  a mid-sized farm or wet market - spreads first to people there (primary contacts), and then moves outward to others (seconday contacts) they interact with through homes, schools and other workplaces.  Homes, schools and workplaces formed a fixed network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;By tracking primary and secondary infections, the researchers estimated key transmission metrics, including the basic reproductive number, R0 - which measures how many people, on average, one infected person passes the virus on to. In the absence of a real-world pandemic, the researchers instead modelled a range of plausible transmission speeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Then they tested what happens when different interventions - culling birds, quarantining close contacts and targeted vaccination - kicked in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The results were blunt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Culling of birds works - but only if done before the virus infects a human. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If a spillover does occur, timing becomes everything, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Isolating infected people and quarantining households can stop the virus at the secondary stage. But once tertiary infections appear - friends of friends, or contacts of contacts - the outbreak slips out of control unless authorities impose much tougher measures, including lockdowns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Targeted vaccination helps by raising the threshold at which the virus can sustain itself, though it does little to change the immediate risk within households.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Bloomberg via Getty Images Chicks at a poultry farm in Kachhawa village, near Karnal, Haryana, India." class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;India's poultry industry is one of the world's largest&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The simulations also highlighted an awkward trade-off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Quarantine, introduced too early, keeps families together for long stretches - and increases the chance that infected individuals will pass the virus to those they live with. Introduced too late, it does little to slow the outbreak at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The researchers say this approach comes with caveats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The model relies on one synthetic village, with fixed household sizes, workplaces and daily movement patterns. It does not include simultaneous outbreaks seeded by migratory birds or by poultry networks. Nor does it account for behavioural shifts - mask-wearing, for instance - once people know birds are dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Atlanta-based Emory University, adds another caveat: this simulation model "assumes a very efficient transmission of influenza viruses".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Transmission is complex and not every strain will have the same efficiency as another," she says, adding that scientists are also now starting to understand that not all people infected with seasonal flu spread the virus equally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She says emerging research shows that only a "subset of flu-positive individuals actually shed infectious influenza virus into the air". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This mirrors the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51447143" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;super-spreader phenomenon&lt;/a&gt; seen with Covid-19, though it is far less well characterised for flu - a gap that could strongly influence how the virus spreads through human populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;What happens if H5N1 becomes successful in the human population?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Lakdawala believes that it "will cause a large disruption likely more similar to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/influenza-a-%28h1n1%29-outbreak?utm_source=chatgpt.com" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;2009 [swine flu] pandemic&lt;/a&gt; rather than Covid-19".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"This is because we are more prepared for an influenza pandemic.

Dr Lakdawala says if H5N1 becomes established in humans, it could re-assort - or intermingle - with existing strains, amplifying its public-health impact. Such mixing could reshape seasonal influenza, triggering "chaotic and unpredictable seasonal epidemics".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The Indian modellers say the simulations can be run in real time and updated as data come in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;With refinements - better reporting delays, asymptomatic cases - they could give public-health officials something priceless in the early hours of an outbreak: a sense of which actions matter most, before the window for containment snaps shut.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;i id="follow-bbc-news-india-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;Follow BBC News India on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;&lt;i id="youtube," class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;YouTube,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBCIndia" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 23:56:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBYeDhIZ0tyYXBIUjN6RzdQLTFlT05oTkFTLTlSSHdYOG9SVjZwT21lVHF3a1ZURjRxa0NrQ1YtYnZfRlREbkVMX3FOUDh4QjVTczk0WGdyemJPd9IBX0FVX3lxTE1mbTc0bWczN0R4ZGRGNWpWaUhLVklKSEdpQWNTTXlmSXJJWGFTeDdsSWFjLVFYemxCdnJfWkpJUXlOcFBic0dRNGJLR0NZbW1TQ01seWtfYVNjc0pFU09R</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，洛杉矶森林大火后心脏病发作增加-《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/17/los-angeles-wildfires-heart-attacks</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the first 90 days after the devastating Palisades and Eaton fires that destroyed entire Los Angeles neighborhoods, there was a 46% increase in ER visits for heart attack symptoms at LA’s Cedars-Sinai hospital, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.10.079" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;newly released study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Rates of heart attacks in January 2025 actually surpassed heart attack rates during all the prior Januaries, even during the Covid years,” Dr Susan Cheng, director of public health research at Cedars-Sinai and the study’s senior author, told the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Residents in the zip codes directly affected by the January wildfires or located adjacent to a fire-affected area also reported a 24% increase in pulmonary illness and a staggering 118% increase in blood test abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Palisades fire was the &lt;a href="https://www.wildfirela.org/history/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;most destructive fire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; history, destroying 6,800 structures and killing 12 people. To the east, the Eaton fire devastated the neighborhood of Altadena, with 19 confirmed deaths. More than &lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2025/1/7/eaton-fire/updates/262ba0be-593a-463c-94b1-a15d1e7f2a1e" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;9,400 structures&lt;/a&gt; were destroyed across Altadena and neighboring Pasadena and Sierra Madre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The findings, which were released in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, are part of &lt;a href="https://lafirehealth.org/data/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a research project&lt;/a&gt; on the short- and long-term impact of the fires on human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cedars-Sinai medical center is located approximately 10 and 20 miles from the epicenters of the Palisades and Eaton fires, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“What we saw during the wildfires was an excess of respiratory illness showing up in our ER that matched the worst years of Covid,” Cheng said. “And that was striking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While some increased respiratory illness was expected due to the effects of wildfire smoke,Cheng said she was surprised not only by the percentage of increase, but also by the jump in heart attack incidences and blood test abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“For a very large number of people, the January wildfire exposures led to a biochemical or metabolic stress on the body that likely affected, not just one, but multiple organ systems,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The blood test data came from patients who reported physical symptoms that did not have a clear diagnosis, such as dizziness without clear signs of dehydration or chest pains without other signs of a heart attack. Cheng noted that the patients’ blood tests revealed subtle abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The blood tests could show their electrolytes were a little bit off, like sodium, potassium, or there’s a slight imbalance in their protein levels,” she said. “Or there’s a slight change in markers of kidney and liver function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Palisades and Eaton fires were particularly harmful to human health due to their classification as a “wildland-urban interface fire (WUI)”. This type of fire spreads more easily than a wildfire-only or urban-only fire, burning a combination of organic materials and industrial fuels, such as plastic, batteries, and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While the data collected by Chang and her colleagues is a start, there are still many questions left to be answered on the long-term effects of January’s fires on human health. “There’s a lot of work to do,” she said. “We’re still working hard to put the pieces together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 23:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQaEwxdlNHd1N3czBWeDJESHJTU1hENVVpQ0lVY0pjS3h2VWZnTENmOXBLZkstYk5WekpEb3BYWUt0SmdpczlvZmFBaHZiTlA5REM3MEw0NUk3R1Y2YkNuZnpDWUJqSnBZVm9xd296ZlpsQUs2R1Fxc2s2OTd2Y2V4R2l0eEZNMG9TSkxz</guid></item><item><title>被亚特兰大地铁皮肤科医生毁容的男子家庭获得了5680万美元的$ - WSB-TV</title><link>https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/family-man-disfigured-by-metro-atlanta-dermatologist-awarded-568-million/ZEL7NJ5RHRBVLL2RSTMUNRUULE/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="default__ArticleBody-sc-tl066j-1 jPcFTl article-body-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;FULTON COUNTY, Ga. — A jury awarded more than $50 million to the estate of Vietnam veteran Tony Waldrop after finding that a doctor disfigured him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 gJuxXh body-paragraph"&gt;In 2013, Waldrop was suffering from skin cancer on his right ear and was getting treated at the VA for years with no problems.

						&lt;p&gt;Seasonal visitation restrictions at WakeMed’s facilities will go into effect on Dec. 22 to try to limit the spread of illness during flu season.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Starting on the 22nd, children younger than 12 will not be allowed to visit patients in WakeMed hospital nursing units, patient care areas and waiting rooms. The measure is to prevent the spread of respiratory syncytial virus and the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The policy includes Healthplex emergency departments and WakeMed Mental Health and Well-Being Hospital – WakeBrook.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"We truly understand that this annual visitation restriction can be difficult for families, but we are committed to ensuring our patients are safe while they are in our care," said a WakeMed spokesperson. "Restricting visitation is best clinical practice to prevent the spread of viruses within our facilities."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/flu-deaths-north-carolina-october-2025/"&gt;Eleven people have died from the flu in North Carolina&lt;/a&gt; as of Wednesday, Dec. 17, for the 2025-2026 flu season.&lt;/p&gt;

as food&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by Luz María Alzate Tamayo, a food scientist at the &lt;a href="https://lasalle.edu.co/es/wps/portal/Home/Principal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lasallian University Corporation&lt;/a&gt; in Colombia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her research focuses on how this carob-like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gold-found-growing-in-norway-spruce-christmas-tree-needles-finland-forests/"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt; can supply safe natural ingredients for the food industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hymenaea courbaril is native to tropical forests from southern Mexico through the Amazon basin and into parts of the Caribbean. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local people know it by many names, including algarrobo, guapinol, and jatobá, and value it both as shade and as food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each pod is built like a tough container, with a woody shell and a dry but edible pulp pressed around the seeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pale pulp tastes slightly sweet and floury, and it dries well, which makes it easy to mill and store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For centuries, communities across these regions have milled the pulp into flour for porridges, drinks, and simple baked foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tree has also fed animals and supported traditional remedies for digestive troubles and chronic respiratory infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lab-tested-nutrients"&gt;Lab tested nutrients&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One detailed &lt;a href="https://www.scielo.cl/pdf/rchnut/v47n3/0717-7518-rchnut-47-03-0366.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; looked at pulp flour and fibrous residue from a Brazilian variety known as &lt;em&gt;jatobá da mata&lt;/em&gt; and measured its nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That team found 44 grams of dietary fiber, indigestible plant material that adds bulk, and 11 grams of protein per 100 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrition researchers describe these concentrated fractions as functional foods, everyday products formulated to deliver a health benefit beyond basic calories and protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulp flour blended into breads, snacks, and breakfast foods could lift fiber intake without adding sugar or synthetic additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The better known Mediterranean carob &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/slow-and-steady-tree-growth-wins-the-race-for-carbon-capture/"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ceratonia siliqua&lt;/em&gt;, supplies cocoa like powders and drinks that use most of the pod instead of discarding it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent scientific &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5710/11/1/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; described these beverages as naturally sweet, caffeine free, and rich in polyphenols, fiber, and minerals for health focused consumers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hymenaea-courbaril-as-medicine"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hymenaea courbaril&lt;/em&gt; as medicine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern studies show that the jatobá &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/giant-trees-never-seen-before-up-to-3000-years-old-tessmannia-princeps-tasmania/"&gt;tree&lt;/a&gt; carries many polyphenols, plant molecules that can neutralize reactive oxygen and other unstable chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In bark, leaf, and seed extracts, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6382/12/11/1601" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; saw strong inhibition of &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; growth at relatively low concentrations in culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These same preparations scored high in tests of antioxidant capacity, a measure of how well a substance blocks damage from reactive oxygen molecules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some tests, leaf extracts from &lt;em&gt;Hymenaea courbaril&lt;/em&gt; matched or exceeded strong synthetic antioxidants, showing that the foliage is chemically very active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work on pod residues, the material left after the edible pulp, highlights compounds called procyanidins, flavonoid chains that give astringent taste and antioxidant behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That study found these molecules alongside quercetin and taxifolin derivatives, giving extracts a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39599418/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt; that might support antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects in foods and possibly people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional medicine in Brazil and Colombia reflects these findings, using jatobá sap and bark decoctions as tonics for chronic coughs, fatigue, and difficult infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early experiments hint at wound healing and liver protective effects in animals, yet doctors still need larger controlled studies before trusting those claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lessons-from-hymenaea-courbaril"&gt;Lessons from &lt;em&gt;Hymenaea courbaril&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For food companies, the big industrial hook lies in the seed gum, a family of galactomannans, carbohydrates that swell and thicken water based mixtures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seed gums from Hymenaea courbaril appear structurally similar, which is why scientists expect them to behave much like the carob based gums used today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In regulatory language, carob bean gum, also called locust bean gum, is classified as a thickener and stabilizer rather than as a flavoring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Joint FAO and WHO expert &lt;a href="https://apps.who.int/food-additives-contaminants-jecfa-database/Home/Chemical/940" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;committee&lt;/a&gt; says carob bean gum has no set intake limit for the general population at approved uses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, seed gum from carob-like trees can stabilize ice creams and dairy desserts by binding water and slowing ice crystal growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That smoother texture can allow recipe developers to cut fat or sugar while delivering creamy products that keep structure during transport and storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this chemistry matters because isolated fiber fractions from carob relatives have shown direct effects on blood lipids in people with high cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one clinical &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14569404/"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt;, 15 grams of carob fiber for six weeks reduced LDL cholesterol by 10.5 percent in adults with high levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40905618_Propiedades_farmacologicas_del_Algarrobo_Hymenaea_courbaril_Linneaus_de_interes_para_la_industria_de_alimentos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revista Lasallista de Investigación&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

					&lt;/p&gt;

					
						&lt;p&gt;Someone with measles last week traveled through terminal two
of Raleigh-Durham International Airport while infected, according to the state
and Wake County.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services
[DHHS] said the person lives in another state.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"Measles is a highly contagious disease and it spreads
quickly in children and adults who are not vaccinated," said State
Epidemiologist Zack Moore. "All North Carolinians should ensure that they
and their families are up to date on their MMR vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The person arrived in the early morning of Dec. 10 at the
terminal, according to the DHHS.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;There is no known health risk at the Raleigh-Durham
International Airport as of Wednesday, according to the state.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Public health leaders are recommending all unvaccinated
individuals ages 1 year and older receive measles vaccination to protect
themselves and those around them. Measles vaccine is also recommended for
infants 6-11 months who will be traveling internationally or to areas with
active measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Any person that was in terminal 2 between 4 a.m. to 8 a.m.
on Wednesday, Dec. 10 could have been exposed to measles and should monitor for
measles-like symptoms until Jan. 1, 2026. The state also urges anyone there to &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/ncdhhs.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=58ec19aaea4630b1baad0e5e4&amp;amp;id=e6db9e9c41&amp;amp;e=00ecd6c0b8__;!!M5erwxGTI6mlTHJSECWB8LY!E1F1tNNYg0x5orCc-_-U5yI4Q7JlFsXwLVlYfxtXDcJ18UHnX9pHgzDSDQTo2_FiVAVR7zsa2jU4hQ$"&gt;contact

						&lt;p&gt;As of Dec. 9, 2025, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention has reported 1,912 people from 43 states as confirmed measles cases
this year. This is the highest number of measles cases reported in the U.S.
since the second dose of MMR vaccine became widely used in the early 1990s. No
cases of measles have been identified in North Carolina residents in 2025,
though a confirmed case was identified in June in a child who traveled to North
Carolina from another country where measles outbreaks had recently been
reported.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Measles is a respiratory disease that is spread through the
air by coughing and sneezing. It can also be transmitted through contact with
secretions from the nose or mouth of an infected person. The virus can live for
up to two hours in the air where the infected person was present. Symptoms of
measles usually begin seven to 14 days after exposure, but can appear up to 21
days after exposure and may include:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (may spike to more than 104 degrees)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots on the inner cheeks, gums and roof of the mouth (Koplik Spots) two to three days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that is red, raised, blotchy; usually starts on face, spreads to trunk, arms and legs three to five days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Measles can lead to severe complications like pneumonia and
encephalitis, especially in young children. Globally, measles killed
approximately 95,000 people in 2024, with most of those being unvaccinated
children 5 and under. This number has dropped 88% since 2000 thanks to
vaccination efforts, meaning measles vaccines saved nearly 59 million lives
since that time.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Vaccinations are safe, effective and remain the best way to
prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and death from respiratory viral
infections and from vaccine-preventable infections like measles. Measles can be
prevented by the combination MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/ncdhhs.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=58ec19aaea4630b1baad0e5e4&amp;amp;id=73eee22f8e&amp;amp;e=00ecd6c0b8__;!!M5erwxGTI6mlTHJSECWB8LY!E1F1tNNYg0x5orCc-_-U5yI4Q7JlFsXwLVlYfxtXDcJ18UHnX9pHgzDSDQTo2_FiVAVR7zvEVZIDWQ$"&gt;The
MMR vaccine is highly effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing measles, and it is
recommended that all adults and children 1 year and older be up to date on
their measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sourdough’s long fermentation boosts digestion and gut health by increasing probiotics, prebiotics, and reducing hard-to-digest carbs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its fermentation also reduces gluten and phytates, improving nutrient absorption—though it’s still not safe for people with celiac disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compared with most breads, sourdough has a lower glycemic index and offers antioxidant benefits that support blood sugar control and reduce oxidative stress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you eat sourdough bread, you're getting more than a delicious base for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/853635/favorite-sandwich-recipes" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sandwiches&lt;/a&gt; and toast. You'll also experience many benefits for health, as the bread is high in essential nutrients. In fact, sourdough bread is considered to be one of the &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/healthiest-breads-to-eat-11701423" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;best breads to eat&lt;/a&gt;, particularly if you choose a loaf with a minimal ingredients list. Yet, you might wonder: What happens to the body when you eat sourdough, and how does it compare to other varieties of bread? We spoke with dietitians to find out.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sourdough bread is made of flour, water, salt, and a starter. "A &lt;a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/how-to-make-sourdough-starter-8547141" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sourdough starter&lt;/a&gt; is made using water and flour that is fermented for approximately seven days (or more) in order to develop an active culture, contributing to its flavor and ability to rise," says Samantha Coogan, MS, RDN, LD, FAND, registered dietitian nutritionist, program director of the didactic program in nutrition and dietetics, and senior lecturer at the department of kinesiology and nutrition sciences at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. This is different from other breads, which use traditional dry yeast to rise, says Connie Elick, RD,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;registered dietitian and health-centered culinary arts instructor at the Institute of Culinary Education.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are the effects of consuming sourdough.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Improved Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since sourdough bread undergoes a longer fermentation process than regular breads, it contains beneficial bacteria, says Elick. These bacteria, known as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/best-probiotic-foods-11791312" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, are advantageous for digestion. "Sourdough is also a good source of fiber and prebiotics, which is what feeds probiotics," says Coogan. This is important because a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/8197882/best-recipes-gut-health" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthy gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; can help strengthen the immune system, reduce inflammation, and possibly improve mental health, says Elick.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Easier Digestion &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have gluten sensitivity or irritable bowel disease, eating sourdough vs. other breads might be easier on your GI tract. According to Coogan, the fermentation process decreases FODMAPs (i.e., poorly absorbed carbs) and gluten, making it easier to digest. But take note: Sourdough "is not safe for those with Celiac disease due to the lingering gluten content," says Coogan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Reduced Oxidative Stress &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sourdough contains selenium, an essential nutrient for optimal health, says Elick. "Selenium functions as an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.marthastewart.com/antioxidant-foods-11765686" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant&lt;/a&gt; that protects us from toxins and free radicals that can cause oxidative damage," notes Elick. As a result, it keeps cells, DNA, and proteins safe, she says.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Improved Blood Sugar Control &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sourdough has a lower glycemic index than most other breads. (A food's glycemic index measures how quickly it increases blood sugar.) This is due to the fermentation process, which makes the starch portion of the bread less readily available for digestion and absorption in the bloodstream, says Coogan. Thus, compared to other types of bread, sourdough won't raise your blood sugar levels as quickly, according to Coogan. The result? A lower risk for type 2 diabetes and related complications.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block marthastewart-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Enhanced Nutrient Absorption &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you eat sourdough bread, you'll be able to absorb more nutrients vs. when you consume other varieties of bread. That's because sourdough contains fewer phytates, or "anti-nutrient" compounds found in grains. Phytates "bind to certain minerals such as zinc and iron, preventing them from being absorbed," says Elick. However, "the longer, more acidic fermentation process of sourdough makes it possible to break down more phytates than regular bread," says Elick. This paves the way for better nutrient absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

A new study shows that mosquitoes lock onto human scent and purposefully follow it until they find an attack opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team working in Zambia built a 35,000 cubic foot (990 cubic meter) outdoor flight cage and found that smell steers mosquitoes to people with striking precision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important signal was not heat alone, but the mix of airborne chemicals that rises from resting bodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One number stands out because it marks a pivot in behavior. When 400 parts per million of carbon dioxide was added to warm targets, mosquito landing flipped from rare to routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-mosquitoes-stalk-humans"&gt;How mosquitoes stalk humans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by Conor J. McMeniman, Ph.D., at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (&lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JHBSPH&lt;/a&gt;). His research focuses on mosquito sensory biology and how human scent shapes the way these insects seek hosts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822%2823%2900532-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers tested hundreds of female malaria mosquitoes at night, using heated landing pads and controlled streams of air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human whole-body odor beat carbon dioxide by a wide margin, and some people were consistently chosen over others during head to head tests. Night after night, mosquitoes &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/female-mosquitoes-control-mating-with-a-single-move/"&gt;returned&lt;/a&gt; to the same person’s odor, revealing stable individual risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single sensory idea ties the results together. This is thermotaxis, which is directed movement guided by temperature differences, often toward warm skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temperature mattered only when smell pointed the insects close enough to a target, and then it helped finalize landing on the artificial skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-scent-beats-other-cues-for-mosquitoes"&gt;Scent beats other cues for mosquitoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0960-9822%2815%2900740-X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; showed that carbon dioxide draws mosquitoes into visual range, where dark shapes help them home in, and warmth then triggers landing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Zambian field system confirms that smell remains the master signal across longer distances, with vision and heat playing backup roles only after scent detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The odorants at play are volatile organic compounds. These are gases that evaporate easily from skin and breath, and carry information across air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-skin-acids-key-to-mosquito-appeal"&gt;Skin acids key to mosquito appeal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classic lab &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2746306/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; linked strong attraction to combinations of ammonia and lactic acid with short-chain acids. Mosquito response was far greater to the mixtures than to any one ingredient by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867422012533" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; tied people’s mosquito appeal to higher levels of certain skin acids collected over days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molecular &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10313001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; indicates that conserved ionotropic receptors in mosquitoes respond specifically to these short-chain acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those findings match the Zambian results, which ranked people by allure and then connected that ranking to their emitted chemical fingerprints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That receptor level match helps explain why blends rich in these compounds pull mosquitoes reliably, even when other cues vary with weather or background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-mosquitoes-track-humans"&gt;How mosquitoes track humans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team piped air, from tents holding sleeping volunteers, to warmed landing targets. They then recorded every touchdown under low light. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding 400 parts per million of carbon dioxide (above background) to heat alone produced sharp spikes in landings. However, full human odor streams produced many more landings than carbon dioxide by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then ran a six-person competition to watch &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/what-really-attracts-mosquitoes-your-habits-can-make-you-a-target/"&gt;preference&lt;/a&gt; patterns stabilize across multiple nights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most attractive person emitted higher relative levels of certain carboxylic acids – acidic molecules from skin metabolism and microbes. In contrast, the least attractive person emitted lower levels of those acids and more eucalyptol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-details-of-experimental-procedure"&gt;Details of experimental procedure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The setup relied on repeated trials staged during the hours when &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mating-secrets-of-mosquitoes-may-help-us-gain-control-of-them/"&gt;female&lt;/a&gt; mosquitoes typically hunt, roughly late evening into early morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targets were held near 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius), which is close to the temperature of human skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meant the odor data, rather than temperature differences, drove the key outcomes across the long and quiet nights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemical sampling followed a technique known as volatilomics. This involves analysis of the full mix of airborne molecules released from a living body, thus capturing a broad snapshot of scent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That approach allowed the team to link behavior to specific compounds without losing the complexity of real human odor plumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-protecting-humans-from-mosquitoes"&gt;Protecting humans from mosquitoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One path is to blend the most attractive acids into lures that work without people being present, allowing traps to pull mosquitoes away from sleeping families and into monitored stations. Another is to tone down people’s chemical profiles so that mosquitoes find them harder to locate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet-linked molecules such as eucalyptol appeared higher in the least attractive person, yet any quick fix should be viewed cautiously because whole odor blends, not single notes, set overall appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designing effective personal protection will likely require tuning multiple scent components at once. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The receptor &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10313001/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; points to families of sensors that could be targeted by future repellents that keep signals from reaching the mosquito brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health groups can use these insights to map risk and focus resources where they help most. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When communities know who tends to be bitten more often and why, they can combine bed nets, indoor spraying, and scent-tuned traps to shrink malaria transmission during the dangerous night hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00532-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 19:44:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxPc0I5cG5Id2JTTGYxZEZCZ3Ezc21qU1cyRHJoek0weklQbXBiZGh2YzY0djhGcmxVLUdaQ3Vhb3JGYnB3SU9JMFBlZElYZWx1T1p2TDJZOFF6cGtYRmtWT2diUGdHWHRJbW52S0wzc0habV90aGx6SjdTTTRNTVpMaFlNTG4wblRITXZSQWExOGo4ZDQ1QkMtY052b1dsdm95Ri1SaUV3</guid></item><item><title>高脂奶酪，奶油与降低痴呆风险有关：研究- ABC新闻</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/high-fat-cheese-cream-linked-lower-risk-dementia/story?id=128462994</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;People who regularly ate higher-fat cheese and cream had a lower risk of developing dementia over 25 years, while low-fat dairy and other dairy foods showed no clear association, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Those who consumed 50 grams per day or more of high-fat cheese daily – roughly a third of a cup – had a lower overall risk of dementia, vascular dementia, a form of cognitive decline caused by impaired blood flow to the brain, according to the 25-year Swedish study of nearly 28,000 people &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.neurology.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-86cUYHzpQHQMqNwIoGevmgeHxuOKGKJ1kN1IkyYVRZQpIXqb0S4c_A4wO9sn6E1bRS5O7nIFzqOYXSdJ6Mw1S4_YISxQ&amp;amp;_hsmi=394072636&amp;amp;utm_content=394072636&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;published in Neurology&lt;/a&gt;, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;People who averaged at least 20 grams of high-fat cream – about one and a half tablespoons – also showed a lower dementia risk, the study indicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, the study did not find similar benefits for low-fat cheese, low-fat cream or butter. Milk consumption, whether high- or low-fat, also did not lower dementia risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;According to Emily Sonestedt, an associate professor at Lund University and senior author of the study, the reason full-fat cheese and cream show benefits for the brain while whole milk does not could be down to differences in nutrition and how these products fit into people’s diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Cheese is fermented, which produces bioactive compounds that may influence inflammation and blood vessels. Cream is usually used in home-cooked meals, not consumed in large quantities on its own," Sonestedt told ABC News. "Milk intake, on the other hand, varies more across diet patterns and doesn't have the same fermentation process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Source and quality of dairy may matter too, Dr. Richard Isaacson, a neurologist specializing in dementia prevention at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Not all cheese is created equal," Isaacson said. "What a cow eats determines what's in the milk — and that determines what's in the cheese", he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Isaacson explained that dairy from grass-fed cows, especially those who ate grass their entire lives, usually contain higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Omega-3 fatty acids are preferentially protective for the brain," said Isaacson, adding that this is true particularly for people at risk of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The 15-20% of people who carry at least one copy of a genetic variant known as APOE ε4 genetic variant, did not benefit from any type of dairy intake, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The fact that we saw a clearer association with vascular dementia, and with Alzheimer's only in people without the APOE ε4 variant, suggests that the pathway may be more related to vascular and metabolic factors than to the core amyloid processes," Sonestedt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The lack of benefit among APOE ε4 carriers highlights the growing understanding that dietary advice for brain health may need to be personalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"People who carry the APOE ε4 gene are more sensitive to saturated fat than people who don't," Isaacson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He added that while saturated fat in moderation may be tolerated by some people, others — particularly those with a high genetic risk for dementia — may need to be more cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"There is no one-size-fits-all approach to Alzheimer's prevention," Isaacson stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But these findings do not prove that eating large amounts of high-fat cheese and cream prevents dementia, Sonestedt cautioned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“It’s an observational study. Cheese and cream may simply be markers of broader eating patterns and lifestyle factors. This is not a green light to dramatically increase intake.” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;An estimated 6.7 million older adults have Alzheimer's disease in the United States. That number is expected to double by 2060, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I wouldn't recommend major diet changes based on one study...

I just pop one before every flight, and I know that I have all my vitamin C and I'm good for the day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-boost-your-immune-system" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Harvard Health Publishing;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Harvard Health Publishing&lt;/a&gt;, vitamin C supports the immune system by protecting cells from free radical damage and enhancing the body's natural defences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other things — including getting adequate sleep, minimizing stress and taking steps to avoid infection (such as washing your hands) — are all ways you can keep your immune system strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Huynh also recommends staying up-to-date on any vaccines you may need for travelling: "A lot of people aren't aware of what shots they need. It doesn't hurt to research that before you go somewhere. There are high cases of measles right now in so many places, so always making sure that your vaccinations are up-to-date is a really big thing that's going to help prevent you from getting sick."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="my-4"&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="2-stay-hydrated"&gt;2. Stay hydrated&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Staying hydrated is important at any time, but especially when flying. According to the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/dehydration-exhaustion-and-gas-what-flying-on-an-airplane-does-to-your-body" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, at high altitudes, the air is almost completely devoid of moisture, which can cause your throat, nose and skin to feel dry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Keeping hydrated is such a key thing, because you don't realize how dehydrated you get being 25,000 feet up in the air," says Huynh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She also recommends bringing an empty reusable water bottle with you — that way, you don't have to rely on beverage service (or buying a marked-up drink at the airport). "I always bring my own water bottle, and I refill it at the airport," she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Huynh also notes that staying hydrated helps you avoid travel-related breakouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Your skin really does get dry in the air," she says. "Personally, I get more oily when I get dry, but when I drink a lot of water, it helps to hydrate my skin, and I don't have as many skin problems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She also says it can help ease jet lag symptoms: "If you just stay hydrated throughout the flight, it kind of keeps you level. It helps you to adjust easier when you land."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="my-4"&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="3-disinfect-surfaces"&gt;3. Disinfect surfaces&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When she travels as a passenger, Huynh says she makes sure to wipe down &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;the surfaces at her seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I get into my seat, I put away all my stuff in the overhead bin and under the seat, and then I grab my wipes, and I wipe down the tray table. If there's a TV screen, I wipe that down too, and then I wipe down the armrests and the seatbelts. ... I find those are the most-frequently touched places, and people touch those without realizing what else they've touched," she says, noting that many people may not wipe down their trays after using them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It's not a thing that people think about. Even with the seatbelt, people get up, sit down, move around and don't think about that either. It's hard to sanitize the actual seatbelt, so I'll just do the buckle, because that's the biggest point of touch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She also recommends carrying a travel-size package of disinfectant wipes for wiping down any high-touch areas, as well as hand sanitizer for your hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Having your own hand sanitizer on the plane and your own disinfectant wipes are really great, just because you can't always get up to go to the washroom [to wash your hands]," says Huynh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="my-4"&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="4-bring-a-travel-medicine-kit"&gt;4. Bring a travel medicine kit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Having a travel health kit with you containing some basic medications — such as anti-motion sickness medication, cold and flu medication and pain relievers — is always a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Huynh also recommends travelling with a pocket pharmacy, like &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.saje.ca/products/pocket-farmacy-physical-edition-black-1?variant=45714050810101" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this one from Saje Natural Wellness;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this one from Saje Natural Wellness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It has mint for migraines and headaches, and then it has a few other scents, and I really like using those when I'm starting to get sick or have a headache or a cough or something like that," she explains, adding she also uses oil of oregano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"If I felt like I was about to get sick, or was sick, I would take a squeeze of the bottle. And I don't know if it's a placebo effect, but I would feel much better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She also likes &lt;a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon Canada;elmt:;cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=63045c63-8df1-46e8-bdd0-1716edf6ace5&amp;amp;siteId=ca-style&amp;amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;amp;contentUuid=9c46518c-93ee-4f64-9b6b-d6d725595f3c&amp;amp;featureId=text-link&amp;amp;merchantName=Amazon+Canada&amp;amp;linkText=ginger+Gravol&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FtYXpvbi5jYS9HcmF2b2wtR2luZ2VyLVRhYmxldHMtU3RvbWFjaC1OYXVzZWEvZHAvQjAwQTVWNkJXVS8_dGFnPXlhaG9vY2FlZGl0LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5YzQ2NTE4Yy05M2VlLTRmNjQtOWI2Yi1kNmQ3MjU1OTVmM2MiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYW1hem9uLmNhL0dyYXZvbC1HaW5nZXItVGFibGV0cy1TdG9tYWNoLU5hdXNlYS9kcC9CMDBBNVY2QldVLyIsImR5bmFtaWNDZW50cmFsVHJhY2tpbmdJZCI6dHJ1ZSwic2l0ZUlkIjoiY2Etc3R5bGUiLCJwYWdlSWQiOiIxcC1hdXRvbGluayIsImZlYXR1cmVJZCI6InRleHQtbGluayJ9&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAXOGt4onvpF95azNv2uasyJcHzxiqiBlqToYWIyydqTq&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.ca%2FGravol-Ginger-Tablets-Stomach-Nausea%2Fdp%2FB00A5V6BWU%2F&amp;amp;spaceId=1197808996" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ginger Gravol;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon Canada;elmt:;cpos:10;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ginger Gravol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for combatting nausea, and says it "really helped" when she was feeling nauseous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="my-4"&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="5-choose-your-seat-wisely"&gt;5. Choose your seat wisely&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Where you sit on the plane can also be important. Some &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/27/8/taaa212/5976283" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;studies &lt;/a&gt;suggest that window seats might expose passengers to fewer infectious particles, as passengers in the window seats have less contact with others than those seated in middle or aisle seats. Huynh says she also prefers to take a window seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I stick to myself. I try to get a window seat so that I can stay away from other people," she says. "I personally don't love aisle seats, just because I feel like I get bumped by people walking through the cabin ... and that's also extra germs that I don't want."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huynh says she tries to pick a window seat on a plane so that she can stay away from other people. (Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Choosing your seat strategically can also help minimize motion sickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"For motion sickness, I would say stick towards the front of the plane, if you can," says Huynh. "I find the back usually feels a bit more turbulence than the front of the plane, so anywhere from the front to middle is usually really good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="my-4"&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="6-stay-warm"&gt;6. Stay warm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Staying warm on a flight isn't just for comfort. Being cold can also impact how your body fights off infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7482896_Acute_cooling_of_the_feet_and_onset_of_common_cold_symptoms" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at the Common Cold Centre at Cardiff University in the U.K. found that having cold feet may actually lower your immune response. So it may be a good idea to skip the sandals, even if you're travelling somewhere hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I'm someone who gets cold easily, so I always have a sweater," says Huynh. "Sometimes I have a pack of socks in my purse. ... Bringing your own sweater, a scarf or a light blanket that fits in your purse or backpack is never a bad idea."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She adds that it is also possible for the flight crew to adjust the in-cabin temperature: "They can adjust it for the front half [of the plane], the back half. And then, if it's a really big aircraft, certain areas are possible too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="my-4"&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="7-consider-wearing-a-mask"&gt;7. Consider wearing a mask&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even though masks are no longer required when flying, they can still be a good idea to prevent the spread of illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/masks.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, when worn by a person with an infection, masks can reduce the spread of the virus to others and can protect wearers from breathing in infectious particles from people around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I personally never wore a mask before COVID," says Huynh. "I found that a lot of travellers in Eastern regions would wear a mask if they were sick, which I thought was such a polite thing to do. I've had people before COVID ask me on board for masks, because either they're sick or they're near someone that's sick."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, she says she'll mask up in certain situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I would wear a mask if I was sick or want to prevent myself from being sick," she says, noting that you can also use the overhead air vent at your seat to get some added airflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="my-4"&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="8-try-a-plane-workout"&gt;8. Try a plane workout&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sitting on an airplane for hours can lead to stiffness, soreness and swelling in your legs and feet, and in some cases, can put you at risk of developing blood clot-related illnesses, such as deep vein thrombosis. Research shows that moving during long flights can help reduce your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I would say as a general rule of thumb, you want to get up and move at least once every two hours," says Huynh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It's not always possible, but I've seen people do squats in the galley and lunges, and do what they have to do. ... Standing up at your seat and taking a stretch once every two hours, that works too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the U.S. &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.stoptheclot.org/in-flight-fitness/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Blood Clot Alliance;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Blood Clot Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, even seated exercises such as ankle circles, knee lifts and overhead stretches can be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Even just stretching your arms goes a long way too, instead of just sitting cramped in and not moving the whole flight," says Huynh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let us know what you think by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="mailto:yahoo.canada.lifestyle.editors@yahooinc.com" data-ylk="slk:emailing us;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;emailing us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; or threading us &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.threads.com/@yahoocanada" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:@yahoocanada;cpos:16;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;@yahoocanada&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

Perfectly still. Suspiciously still. Too still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Our Golden stops in her tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She locks in, ears up, tail frozen mid-wag like her internal Wi-Fi just disconnected. A low grumble starts, then a bark, then a full-on monologue of “Absolutely not, we are not just walking past that frosty intruder like everything is fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Her human can’t help but laugh as she calmly reassures her that the ice man is, in fact, not a threat to national security. The Golden’s body language disagrees. She edges forward a few steps, stops, and barks, then backs up before inching forward again. It’s like watching someone argue with an inanimate object—and somehow lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meanwhile, Lola—watching from the safety of the couch—is ALL IN. She barked at the screen like she wanted to hop in, tag this Golden out, and finish the round herself.

                Early in the pandemic, a volunteer takes part in a clinical trial to develop a vaccine that will protect against COVID-19. The U.S. government has registered over half a million clinical trials since 2000. The vast majority of the trials don't result in a new drug approval.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Just like the moment a mosquito bites, the shot of dengue virus I received in my arm was so quick and painless that afterward I wasn't even sure it happened at all.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I wrote a story about a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/09/21/1112727841/a-box-of-200-mosquitoes-did-the-vaccinating-in-this-malaria-trial-thats-not-a-jo" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;young woman who was infected with malaria by 200 mosquito bites&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to test a potential vaccine. At the time, it was bewildering to me that someone would  be willingly agree to take on so much risk and put themselves through so much discomfort for only a modest sum of money.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yet many people choose to participate in clinical trials for new drugs every year. In fact, it is required in the United States medical system and throughout the world that drugs be tested on human participants in three phases of clinical trials to evaluate their safety and effectiveness before they can be approved for use.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/about-site/trends-charts" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Over half a million clinical trials have been registered on the US government's ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; since the clinical-trial-tracking site launched in February 2000. And &lt;a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/global-clinical-trials-market" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nearly $100 billion is spent every year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the business of running clinical trials. The vast majority of the trials, and the money that goes into them, don't result in a new drug approval.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So when an ad popped up in my Instagram feed suggesting I could earn up to $3,425 for participating in a 5-month-long dengue study at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Immunization Research (CIR), I was intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I wanted to know more about the business and ethics of human medical experimentation. And I was willing to put myself through a little pain to find out. It turns out that within the industry there are constant debates about the roles of risk, race, paternalism, economics, and exploitation in making clinical trials work. But despite all that, clinical trials still rely on some sense of altruism in healthy participants to function.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Informed and uninformed consent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dengue fever is the most-common mosquito-borne viral illness in the world. The World Health Organization estimates that up to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue#:~:text=Key%20facts,million%20infections%20occurring%20each%20year." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;400 million infections happen each year,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and new research suggests that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2512350122" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;climate change is increasing the burden of dengue&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; around the world (&lt;em&gt;Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.&lt;/em&gt; 2025, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2512350122). Yet it's still considered a neglected tropical disease, in part because &lt;a href="https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/drug-discovery/Small-molecule-fights-dengue-mice/99/i38" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;there's no specific FDA approved treatment for severe dengue&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When paired with other conditions such as malnutrition or HIV, which unfortunately are common in some of the areas where dengue is prevalent, it can be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The trial I applied for was taking place in Baltimore, which isn't exactly a dengue hot spot. In fact, cases of dengue infection in the U.S. are extremely rare, but it's relatively common for Phase 1 and 2 drug trials to take place in the U.S. even when the disease burden is located elsewhere. Often the U.S. has the academic expertise and funding to conduct these trials that lower-income countries do not.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I had volunteered to be injected with dengue virus as part of a Phase 2 clinical trial to test the efficacy of an experimental drug at preventing severe dengue infection. There were two cohorts in the study. One group would receive the drug intravenously or a placebo a day before being given the dengue virus, and the other would receive the drug or placebo a few days after being given the dengue virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Before I could volunteer for anything, the CIR needed my consent — a lot of it. On two separate occasions, I reviewed a dense packet of information detailing the risks I was agreeing to, my rights as a research participant, and a code of conduct before being given an open-book test on the content, on which I needed to score 70% or better to continue.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We always say consenting is really an evolving process, and it needs to be," says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/798/anna-p-durbin" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Anna P. Durbin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, director of the CIR. Durbin is the principal investigator on the dengue trial I was participating in, though I never met her in person during any of the times I was at the facilities. She also oversees several other trials taking place at the CIR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, history is fraught with examples of research being done on people without their consent. In World War II, the Nazis performed horrific medical experimentation on Jews and other people imprisoned in concentration camps. The U.S. has its own history of unethical medical study too. The Tuskegee study, which took place from the 1930s to the 1970s, withheld syphilis diagnosis and treatment from Black Americans and then monitored them over years as their health deteriorated. The Willowbrook experiments, which began in 1956 and lasted for 14 years, purposely infected children with mental disabilities with hepatitis.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But then, in 1978, the U.S. National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research published the &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/read-the-belmont-report/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Belmont Report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This landmark document outlined three core ethical principles of human research: respect for persons, which mandates informed consent and autonomy of research participants; beneficence, a fancy term for the philosophy of "Do no harm"; and justice, which ensures the benefits and risks of human research are distributed fairly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That, in turn, led to regulation in the U.S. requiring that medical research on human participants be evaluated for good ethics by Institutional Review Boards (IRBs).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Durbin, a member of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health IRB, says that evaluating a clinical trial's ethics requires a detailed discussion. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What we're really concerned with is how the volunteers are informed. Are all of the procedures ethical? What are the risks? How are they being mitigated? That sort of thing," she says. If a proposed study doesn't answer those questions sufficiently, then it's back to the drawing board to alter the methodology.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most of the information discussed by an IRB must be communicated to the participants.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have to make sure that you know what's going to happen to you when you're in a study," Durbin says. "Are you being compensated or not? That's important information. What happens to your samples? Can you withdraw or can't you withdraw? Who's going to see your information?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's a lot for participants to understand. And if they don't understand it, they can't ethically consent. That's why I had to take two tests before I could volunteer. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I still think our consent forms are too long, but I think it's also difficult to exactly know what to take out to make sure that people are fully informed," Durbin says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking a calculated risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Thanks to the consent forms, I felt as if I had a good grasp of the study. But I was still nervous.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;I was going to receive &lt;a href="https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/drug-discovery/choose-disease-fighting-molecule/103/web/2025/04" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;experimental monoclonal antibodies — &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;lab-made proteins that mimic the natural antibodies your immune system makes to fight off an infection — or a placebo . But getting the antibodies would come with no guarantee of long-term protection from dengue.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The day of dosing featured a grueling process of getting an IV infusion and repeatedly being pricked for blood draws over 5 hours while my arms bruised. Ultimately, discomfort was all I suffered on this day. Phase 1 clinical trials had all but confirmed the drug in development was safe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The next day, a nurse injected my arm with a genetically modified version of the DENV-3 serotype of the dengue virus designed to give only mild illness rather than full-blown "break-bone fever," as the illness is known colloquially.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I was told that the symptoms of dengue are a lot like flu symptoms, but that dengue also comes with a full-body rash, achy bones and pain behind the eyes. A week after the injection (and after an unfortunately timed weeklong bout of COVID-19), I developed all these symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More concerning to me than the mild illness was that the consent forms also warned of a property of the dengue virus called antibody-dependent enhancement. Viruses with antibody-dependent enhancement are more dangerous the second time someone gets the disease because the virus can take advantage of a person's imperfect antibodies from a previous infection to better infect cells. So if I were to ever get dengue again, I would be at a much greater risk for severe disease. That's a risk I now carry with me for the rest of my life. What exactly made that risk acceptable?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sph.rutgers.edu/directory/nir-eyal" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nir Eyal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a bioethicist at Rutgers School of Public Health, says that studies conducted on people with a medical condition take into consideration the "risk-benefit balance" when determining what is appropriate. Outside of a study setting, "sometimes it's worth taking a very risky substance when it's very beneficial for you; dangerous [chemotherapy] is worth it sometimes if your cancer is bad enough and you have no alternatives," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For clinical trials on healthy people, the calculus is different. Eyal says calculating the appropriate level of risk happens in three stages. The first stage is to "minimize the risks, maximize or promote the benefits as much as you can," he says. For example, the genetically modified serotype of the dengue virus I was given was designed to give as mild a clinically relevant disease state as possible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Not all risks can be designed away though, so the second stage, and the most important one according to Eyal, is to ask: Are the risks to the individual proportionate to the potential benefits for society? &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm not asking, Are the risks for the individual okay in light of the benefits to the individual?" he says. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The person participating in the trials is allowed to incur some risk, without receiving any medical benefit in return, so long as it's for the greater good.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The third stage of determining acceptable risk for a clinical trial is to ask, are the absolute risks to the individual simply too high, no matter how much value the trial may have for society?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Eyal says he doesn't see the need for an upper threshold of risk to an individual in a clinical trial. He believes that as long as an individual is properly informed, that individual should be able to take on as much risk as they are willing, provided there is enough benefit to society. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The first participants of some of the U.S. malaria challenge trials were researchers who wanted to develop the vaccine, and they volunteered," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Eyal's views on the upper limits of risk in clinical trials aren't universally held by the ethicists and researchers who make the decisions to approve clinical trials. Presently, IRBs tend to lean conservative when it comes to acceptable risks to participants — perhaps justifiably so, given the field's history of medical abuse.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That cautiousness has led to questions about the role of paternalism in clinical trial design and implementation. It's a hot topic in discussions about clinical trial ethics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay and paternalism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In compensation for being poked and prodded, looking and feeling like garbage for a few days, and making the 2½-hour round trip into the CIR facilities a total of 17 times over 5 months, I was paid roughly $3,500. That's money I'll have to pay taxes on later. Now, after all is nearly said and done, I feel it was worth my effort. That money is funding a vacation and a few upgrades around the house.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But $3,500 means different things to different people. For folks fortunate enough to have plenty tucked away in savings, it may not be compelling. And for others struggling to pay bills, it could mean keeping a roof over their head or food on the table.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Historically, the review boards that oversee clinical trial development have been hesitant to incentivize participation via large cash awards. This comes from a fear that setting compensation too high will unduly influence those who need the money to participate in something they wouldn't otherwise be willing to do, according to Durbin, though she disagrees and has advocated for higher pay.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Josh Morrison, president and cofounder of &lt;a href="https://www.1daysooner.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;1Day Sooner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that advocates for clinical trial participants, says the logic behind compensation restriction is "wrong and patronizing and unfair to the people who join studies because they need the money."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;1Day Sooner was born out of the COVID-19 pandemic as a coalition of folks who wanted to help by participating in COVID-19 challenge studies. In the post pandemic world, 1Day Sooner now serves as a voice for participants in conversations with those who guide clinical trial development.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Morrison says that attitudes of paternalism and elitism underlie IRB fears over high compensation. But if all the efforts are made to ensure that a study is ethical in the first place, "paying more money to people doesn't affect that." It's only when studies are inherently unethical that high compensation might trick people into participating, Morrison says. And that shouldn't ever happen. Compensation should be based on the time and effort spent participating in the trial and not the risk inherent to a study, because these studies should never be excessively risky in the first place, Morrison says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/socialmed/directory/jill-fisher/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jill Fisher&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a bioethicist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, feels that arguments over patient compensation can sometimes ignore a bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; "There's all this worry that if you offer people money, they will feel compelled to do something they don't really want to do otherwise, but on the other hand, I'm more worried we're going to exploit people if we don't pay them enough,"  Fisher says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Fisher has been studying the ethics and demographics of clinical trial participation in the U.S. for over 20 years. And she says that while there isn't sufficient data to determine how many people are participating in clinical trials each year, we do know who is most likely to participate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's mostly Black or African American participants enrolling in these studies, especially in the Northeast and then the Midwest, and then a lot of Hispanic or Latino participants in the Southwest and the Southeast," she says, adding that those who choose to participate often don't have other reliable income sources or reliable access to affordable health care.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the day of my IV infusion, two other trial participants were at the facilities with me. One was a graduate student at Johns Hopkins who said they wanted to do something more for science. The other participant was there "just to get some bread." Durbin asked me not to interview or provide identifying details of any of the other participants in this trial for the story, and I agreed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I've spoken to hundreds of people who participated in these studies. On one hand, most of them are really grateful that they have an opportunity to earn income in this way," Fisher says. "But at the same time, you could feel grateful for an opportunity but also feel exploited. And I think a lot of them do."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;According to several of the sources I spoke to, many people who participate in one trial end up participating in another. Some rely on clinical trials as one of their primary forms of income, but this is rare. More often, participants feel like there's a good reason for them to be involved in a clinical trial beyond the paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's not either-or. People can both have altruistic motivations and care about the money," Morrison says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Firsthand testimony&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-andrew-hopkins/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jacob Hopkins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, altruism was key in choosing to become part of a trial. Back in 2020, Hopkins became the very first person to receive a COVID-19 challenge as part of a weeks-long inpatient clinical trial taking place in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Since taking this huge step into the world of clinical trials and the advocacy side of things for it as well, it's become a complete sort of new passion of mine," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roopeshchavda/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Roopesh Chavda&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has now participated in two COVID-19 challenge trials, doesn't consider being a part of clinical trials a passion but does think it helps do some good for the world. It "wasn't necessarily about the money," he says. " But I would never do something like this without being paid compensation, because there are risks."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hopkins was unemployed when he participated in his clinical trial, Chavda could work remotely during his facility stay, and I had my employer's blessing to take the time to participate in a trial.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For those who feel like they have to participate in clinical trials out of need, there are people like Durbin, Eyal, Fisher, Morrison, and the staff I had the pleasure of working with who are trying hard to improve the experience of being a trial participant little by little.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I felt welcomed, valued, and respected during my time as a trial participant. And I hope sharing that experience will encourage others to consider volunteering themselves.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story was republished with permission from Chemical &amp;amp; Engineering News.

Some of it you might expect, but one major finding is one researchers have never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"When we pulled up we couldn't believe everything was gone," said Altadena resident Claudine Eng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Hours after evacuating, Eng and her children went back to see if their home was still standing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Fire had engulfed the garages and living quarters next to the main house. The family picked up garden hoses to fight the flames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It was an all-day battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Just all the excitement of wanting to put this fire out. That kind of took over.  We kind of didn't think about our safety," said Eng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Now new research reveals that resident don't have to be that close to the fires for very long to experience health effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We found that visits to the ER for respiratory illness increased by 24% after the wildfire started," said Susan Cheng, M.D., M.P.H., Director of Public Health Research at Cedars-Sinai's Smidt Heart Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;And for 90 days after the fires, researchers tracked a 118% increase in visits for general illness and also found that heart attacks rose 46%. But Cheng said what scientists found next was peculiar and surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Here, we've never seen anything like this before," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Scientists found that abnormal blood test results related to general illness more than doubled in the 90-day period in 2025 as compared with that period in previous years. This is a finding not previously reported after major wildfires, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We could see these were patients who came in with coughs, but their chest x-rays were clear. They came in with dizziness, but there weren't signs of dehydration. They came with chest pain, but they weren't having a heart attack," Cheng said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;What did these abnormal lab results mean, and what was the link to all these different, unexplained symptoms?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The January wildfire exposures seem to have led to some kind of a biochemical metabolic stress on the body that likely affected more than just one organ system," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The medical center is located 10 miles from the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7.com/tag/palisades-fire/"&gt;Palisades Fire&lt;/a&gt; and 20 miles from the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7.com/tag/eaton-fire/"&gt;Eaton Fire&lt;/a&gt;.

						Longtime WCVB and ABC News medical editor Dr. Timothy Johnson revealed Wednesday he is battling prostate cancer. On Wednesday’s "Good Morning America," Johnson, 89, said the diagnosis came after a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test during his annual exam. "In my last Medicare annual exam, I walked in the door and said to my doctor, a friend, 'Let's throw in a PSA just for the heck of it.' And it came back 13.7, which is much higher than it should be," Johnson said. "I was stunned. I was absolutely shocked."Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, excluding skin cancer, and a leading cause of cancer death for men in the U.S., second only to lung cancer. Johnson said his cancer has spread to his lymph nodes, but is optimistic. "I'm quite convinced it will be controlled, maybe even cured. But if I had gotten a PSA much earlier, it would be much more simple. The treatment much easier," he said. No recognized medical societies recommend PSA tests for men older than 70 – something Johnson said could have caught his cancer earlier.  "Presumably, I would have noticed it creeping up year to year, and that would have triggered some tests to see if there was cancer there and if there was cancer that was causing the higher PSA, we would have treated it very simply," he said. “But now, because it's more advanced, we have to do some anti-androgen therapy, anti-testosterone therapy and then probably some radiation."Known affectionately as "America's Doctor," Johnson urged men older than 70 to continue to get their PSA tested. "If you're over 70 but you're healthy, your mind is intact, get a yearly PSA for a while. And if they stay low, maybe every two years, maybe every three years," he said. "But don't wait 14 years like I did."Johnson retired from ABC NEWS in 2010, and retired from WCVB-TV in 2012.

But there were also unexpected differences, including higher disease rates than anticipated in individuals older than 85.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is very important work from a beautiful Norwegian study,” says Nicolas Villain, a neurologist at Sorbonne University in Paris who was not involved in the research. The study, published today in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, shows that blood-based tools can improve epidemiological estimates of neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03394-w" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04133-x/d41586-025-04133-x_51656106.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Blood tests are now approved for Alzheimer’s: how accurate are they?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But exactly how to use these tests remains controversial, warns Jason Karlawish, a geriatrician and co-director of the Penn Memory Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02928-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02928-6" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Blood-based markers&lt;/a&gt; can be helpful for physicians treating people with dementia and for answering research questions, but they aren’t ready to be rolled out widely as health screening tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is the kind of test that, in the wrong hands, could cause a lot of harm,” says Karlawish, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From blood to brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), an international team of researchers turned to the Trøndelag Health (HUNT) study, a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/471020a" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/471020a" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;prospective health research study&lt;/a&gt; that started in 1984 and that has collected health data and biological samples from 250,000 Norwegians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using blood samples from 11,486 individuals in the study aged 58 and above, the team looked at levels of a protein called tau that has been phosphorylated at a specific site. Known as pTau217, this blood marker serves as a proxy for the build-up of amyloid plaque in the brain, a hallmark of AD. HUNT study participants over the age of 70 have undergone cognitive testing, enabling the researchers to compare pTau217 levels with the presence of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 10% of participants over the age of 70 had dementia and AD pathology, showing both cognitive impairment and high pTau217, they report. Another 10% had mild cognitive impairments and high pTau217. And 10% had high pTau217 but no signs of cognitive impairment, which the authors refer to as preclinical AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are broadly in line with expectations, but there were surprises too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 25% of people aged 85–89 had dementia and AD pathology, up from previous estimates of around 7% for men and 13% for women in this age group in Western Europeans&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And the incidence of preclinical AD in younger individuals was 8% in those aged 70–74, down from a previous estimate of around 22%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anders Gustavsson, a member of the team that compiled the earlier estimates, welcomes the latest data. “I'm not surprised that this study gets somewhat different numbers,” says Gustavsson, who is an adviser to the health economics consultancy Quantify Research in Stockholm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03596-2" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04133-x/d41586-025-04133-x_51687774.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Alzheimer’s decline slows with just a few thousand steps a day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discrepancies probably reflect selection bias, says study co-author Anita Lenora Sunde, a physician and dementia researcher at Stavanger University Hospital in Norway. Previous estimates were made by recruiting participants for brain scans, and people with dementia might not have wanted to or been able to participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other factors could also be at play, says Villain. The latest study uses a high pTau217 threshold to define its preclinical AD population, and so excludes people with intermediate levels of the protein and emerging pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you lower the threshold, the prevalence suddenly increases,” says Villain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The value of education&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that people with lower education levels have higher pTau217 levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

For juvenile cKO experiments, mice were injected intraperitoneally once at P3–4 with 100 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of tamoxifen. Mice of both sexes were used and sexes were noted. Sample sizes were chosen on the basis of power analyses (80% power) and literature review. Experimenter was blinded to genotype or manipulation when analysing data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Rats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles Rivers) were used at P1–2 for the preparation of primary cortical astrocyte cultures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Surgical procedures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec17"&gt;Juvenile viral injections&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For adeno-associated virus (AAV) injections at P14–15, P11–12, or 3 months of age, C57Bl6/J mice were used. In brief, mice were administered pre-operative carprofen (5 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) subcutaneously and anaesthetized using isoflurane. Stereotaxic coordinates for the binocular zone were 2.25 mm lateral and 0.5 mm anterior from lambda. Virus was injected at 3 sites at a depth of 500–600 µm from just below the skull surface. The pipette was kept in the brain for 3 min after each injection to allow the virus to diffuse. TdT, CCN1 and CCN1(D125A) viruses were injected for a total titre of ~2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; viral genomes (vg) per ml. For snRNA-seq and western blotting, bilateral injections of both binocular zones were performed. After injection, mice were sutured and placed back with the dam if pre-weaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec18"&gt;Monocular enucleation and monocular deprivation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For ME at P28 or 4 months, mice were anaesthetized using isoflurane. The eye was removed using curved forceps and pressure was applied to stop any bleeding. GelFoam was inserted into the eye socket and 2 box sutures (Henry Schein 5616446) were used to close the eyelid. Lidocaine jelly (2.0%, glydo) and erythromycin (0.5%, Bausch + Lomb) was applied to the eyelid. Mice were monitored daily and administered ibuprofen water (0.15 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) to minimize any swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For MD at P23, P28, or 4 months, mice were anaesthetized using isoflurane. Eyelashes were trimmed down to the eyelid margins and 4 box sutures using nylon sutures (Ethilon 1647 G) were used to close the eyelid. Lidocaine jelly (2.0%, glydo) and erythromycin (0.5%, Bausch + Lomb) was applied to the eyelid. Mice were monitored daily and administered ibuprofen water (0.15 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) to minimize any swelling. Mice were removed from the experiment if the eyelids opened. For suture removal, mice were again placed under isoflurane and sutures were removed. Mice were removed from the experiment if the eye looked damaged or cloudy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec19"&gt;Cranial window implantation and viral injections&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For in vivo imaging of ocular dominance plasticity and neuronal response properties, cranial windows were implanted on ~3-month-old &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt; wild-type or &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt;-cKO mice. Mice were injected with buprenorphine SR (1 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, subcutaneously), Baytril (10 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, intramuscularly) and dexamethasone (2 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, intraperitoneally) prior to surgery for anaesthesia, infection prevention and inflammation prevention. Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane inhalant (3%) and maintained at 1.5–2.5% during the surgery. Mice were mounted on a stereotaxic surgical stage via ear bars and a bite bar. Their body temperature was maintained at 37 °C using a heating pad. The scalp was shaved and the skin was removed and the skull surface was allowed to dry. The skull and scalp margins were covered with a thin layer of Vetbond (Fisher Scientific NC0304169). Avoiding the area above visual cortex, a layer of dental cement (Tetric evoflow A1, Henry Schein 9458634) was applied and a metal head plate was glued to skull. A 3 mm circular piece of skull over the binocular zone (coordinates from lambda: 3 mm lateral, 1.0 mm anterior) was removed with a high speed microdrill with a 0.5 mm burr. Care was taken not to damage the dura. Before window implantation, viral injections of AAV2/1-CAMK1a-gCaMP6f (Addgene #100834-AAV1) were made into the binocular zone. A volume of 150 nl was injected into each of 5 sites at a depth of 300 µm from the pia for a total titre of ~1.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; vg. The pipette was kept in the brain after each injection for 3 min to ensure diffusion of the virus before being retracted. A 4 mm diameter coverslip was placed on the dura and sealed to the edges of the skull using Vetbond. Dental cement was then used to further seal the coverslip. Mice were injected subcutaneously with 10 ml kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; physiological saline and carprofen (5 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;,subcutaneously) and placed on a heating pad to recover. Carprofen was administered daily for three days post-surgery. Mice were maintained with Baytril (8.5 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) in their water to prevent infection for 3 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;Bulk RNA sequencing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data for experiments from P28 (critical period) and P120 (adult) mice were obtained from Farhy-Tselnicker et al.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Farhy-Tselnicker, I. et al.

Alignment to the mm10 genome was performed using STAR aligner (v.2.5.1b). Mapping was performed using the default parameters, and &amp;gt;75% uniquely mapped reads were confirmed with exonic alignment.

Enrichment of gene sets and pathways from the GO, Reactome and KEGG databases was carried out. Selection of DEGs for pathway analysis was performed as described above, but without a log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FC cut-off. Genes were ranked on the basis of descending log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FC in each comparison. A cut-off of adjusted &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 was used to determine significantly enriched pathways and terms. Simplifying GSEA results for visualization was conducted by only selecting pathways that were differentially expressed in at least two comparisons. Furthermore, we selected the top three downregulated and upregulated (negative and positive normalized enrichment score, respectively) Reactome pathways in each comparison (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig6"&gt;1b&lt;/a&gt;).

Fifty thousand single nuclei were purified using FACS using a BD FACS Aria Fusion with a 70-µm nozzle. Single Hoechst-positive nuclei were gated using fluorescence measured in the BV421 channel, and debris was excluded using forward and side scatter area and width parameters (FSC-A versus FSC-W, and SSC-A versus SSC-W). Nuclei were kept on ice for all the steps.

Library preparation was carried out immediately after cDNA quality control. Libraries were generated as per the 10X instructions using the V3.1 HT kit. Quality and concentration were measured using an Agilent Tape Station and a Qubit Fluorimeter. Sequencing was performed at the University of Calfornia San Diego IGM Genomics Center using a NovaSeqX (Illumina) at 300 million reads per sample, or ~52 K average reads per cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec28"&gt;Data preprocessing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sequencing reads were mapped onto the mouse genome (mm10) using CellRanger count v.8.0.1. Median unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts per cell were as follows: tdt_replicate1: 6,428, ccn1_replicate1: 7,626, tdt_replicate2: 2,496, ccn1_replicate2: 2,810. Total genes detected were as follows: tdt_replicate1: 26,053, ccn1_replicate1: 25,318, tdt_replicate2: 24,940, ccn1_replicate2: 24,752.

Biological replicates were aggregated separately as they were sequenced in separate runs (replicate 1 and replicate 2) using CellRanger Aggr v.8.0.1 using normalization default parameters. Subsequent analyses were run in R Studio (R v.4.4.1) using Seurat (v.5.1.0). We discarded nuclei with less than 200 and more than 8,000 detected unique genes, with over 20% of sequencing reads mapped to mitochondrial genes and with over 10,000 detected RNA molecules per nucleus (UMI). Raw counts were normalized and scaled using the SCTransform function from Seurat and the default parameters, and log-normalized using NormalizeData. SCT data (normalized and scaled) were only used for visualization purposes for clustering, whereas normalized counts were used in differential expression analysis and all other analyses and visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To integrate the samples from the two different sequencing runs, the IntegrateLayers function from Seurat was used, with the Harmony integration method run using the SCT assay. Clustering was performed using the integrated data, with 30 principal component dimensions for reduction. UMAP embedding was used to visualize the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec29"&gt;Clustering using MapMyCells&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A count matrix as an AnnData object was extracted and uploaded to the Allen Brain Atlas MapMyCells website. The reference taxonomy was the 10x Whole Mouse Brain (CCN20230722), with Hierarchical mapping as the mapping algorithm.

The Seurat FindMarkers function with Wilcoxon ranked sum tests with Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons were used. A min.pct = 0.01 and a log fold change cut-off of 0.0 was used. log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FC and min.pct cut-offs were adjusted for subsequent data visualization in the extended data figures as described in the legends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec31"&gt;Overrepresentation analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;ORA was carried out using gene lists filtered out for up or downregulated significant DEGs (adjusted &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;0.05).

In brief, AUGUR withholds a subset of labelled cell-type data (‘test’ data) and trains random forest classifiers for each cell type. Predictions are made on the unlabelled test data and accuracy is calculated on the basis of the area under the AUC of the classifier predictions.

For all juvenile experiments, to confirm the presence of CCN1 or CCN1(D125A), an antibody against HA was used. To label oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), rabbit anti-NG2 (1:200, Sigma Aldrich AB5320) and rat anti-HA (1:100, Sigma 11867423001) for juvenile experiments were used.

For tissue from P7 mice, slides were incubated with protease plus for 15 min; for P14–P120, protease 3 or 4 10–20 min. Probes used were: &lt;i&gt;Arc&lt;/i&gt; (Biotechne 316911-C1), &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt; (Biotechne 429001-C1), &lt;i&gt;Tubb3&lt;/i&gt; (Biotechne 423391-C3) and &lt;i&gt;Slc1a3&lt;/i&gt; (Biotechne 430781-C2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For experiments done in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig8"&gt;3k,m&lt;/a&gt;, the RNAScope V1 Multiplex assay was performed (Biotechne 320851). For the experiments done in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig9"&gt;4d–m&lt;/a&gt;, the RNAScope V2 Multiplex assay was run (Biotechne 323100) according to manufacturer instructions. The tissue baking step was eliminated and the hydrogen peroxide step was performed at room temperature for 10 min.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;i&gt;Arc&lt;/i&gt; smFISH, three to six sections (technical replicates) were imaged and averaged per mouse (biological replicate). For &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt; smFISH, two to three sections (technical replicates) were imaged and averaged per mouse (biological replicate).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec45"&gt;Western blot&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein concentrations of the whole visual cortex lysates were quantified using the Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad 5000006) on a plate reader (Tecan Infinite 200 PRO). Samples were diluted at least 40× to ensure accurate protein measurements and BSA was used as a standard. Reducing sample buffer (ThermoFisher 39000) was added to 20 µg of total proteins and samples were denatured at 55 °C for 45 min. Samples were then loaded into a 12-well Bolt 4–12% Bis-Tris gradient gel (ThermoFisher NW04122), using a PageRuler Prestained Protein Ladder (ThermoFisher 26626). Gels were run at 100 V for 1.5 h using a Mini gel tank (ThermoFisher A25977) and Bio-Rad PowerPac using MOPS running buffer (ThermoFisher NP000102). Transfer was done in Mini Trans-Blot Gel tank (Bio-Rad 1703930), using Tris-glycine transfer buffer (ThermoFisher 28363) with 20% methanol onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore Immobilin-FL IPFL00010). Membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1 h using 1% casein in Tris buffered saline (TBS; Bio-Rad 1610782). Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Following primary antibody incubation, membranes were washed 3 times for 10 min in TBS (ChemCruz SC-362186) with 1% Tween (TBS-T). Secondary antibodies were used at 1:10,000 for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed with 3 times for 10 min TBS-T and then placed in TBS until they were imaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For CCN1 overexpression validation, sheep anti-CCN1 (1:650, R&amp;amp;D AF4055) and mouse anti-pan actin (1:5000, Sigma Aldrich A1978) were used. Secondaries were donkey anti- sheep Alexa Fluor 680 (ThermoFisher A21102) and donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 800 (ThermoFisher A32789). CCN1 and actin were probed for in the same blot, with CCN1 imaged in the 700 nm channel and actin in the 800 nm channel. The expected molecular mass of CCN1 is 37 kDa and the expected molecular mass of actin is 42 kDa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec46"&gt;Imaging and analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Membranes were imaged on a Licor Odyssey Imager Clx at a resolution of 84 μm (300 dpi). Automatic exposure was used. Analysis was conducted using ImageStudio and background lane fluorescence was used for normalization. CCN1 band intensities were additionally normalized using the actin loading control within each blot. The CCN1 group was also normalized to the tdT group for each membrane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec47"&gt;Histology imaging and analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec48"&gt;Epifluorescence microscopy&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imaging was performed using an Axio Imager.Z2 fluorescent microscope (Zeiss) with the apotome module (Apotome2) and AxioCam HR3 camera (Zeiss) at 10× or 20× magnification, depending on the experiment. Tile images that contained the entire primary visual cortex (from pial surface to white matter tract) were acquired. Number of tiles were maintained consistent within each experiment. Images were 14 bit. All tiles had 10% overlap. For critical period experiments looking at WFA expression, all sections were confirmed to have viral vector expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;i&gt;Arc&lt;/i&gt; smFISH (Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig2"&gt;2b,e&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig4"&gt;4d&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig9"&gt;4e,l&lt;/a&gt;), images were acquired at a single plane at 10× magnification, and the entire section was tiled. &lt;i&gt;Arc&lt;/i&gt; activation width was measured along layer 4 (ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 59" title="Djurisic, M. et al.

For WFA and parvalbumin staining, images were acquired at 20× with 3 tiles taken of the visual cortex at 10% overlap and a &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-stack width of 10–12 μm. For NG2, CC1 and OLIG2 staining in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;, images were also acquired at 20× with 3 tiles taken of the cortex at 10% overlap and a &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-stack width of 10–12 μm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all cases, when comparing wild type and cKO or different viruses per given experiment, slides were imaged on the same day using the same acquisition settings, most notably camera exposure time was kept the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec49"&gt;Confocal and super-resolution microscopy&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;smFISH images used for layer-specific developmental profile of &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt; expression were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal scanning microscope. Images were acquired at 8-bit depth, 1,024 × 1,024 resolution using a 20× objective with a pixel dwell time of 0.79 µs. The scaling per pixel was 0.31 µm × 0.31 µm and 2 frames were averaged per plane. &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-stacks at 1 µm steps were taken and the visual cortex was tiled at 10% overlap. Number of tiles remained consistent between experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For microglia engulfment analysis, a Zeiss LSM 880 with Airyscan module was used. The images were acquired in super-resolution mode with a Fast Airyscan module using an oil-immersion 63× objective with a numerical aperture of 1.46 at a pixel dwell time of 0.60 µs. The scaling per pixel was 0.041 µm × 0.041 µm. &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-stacks with 0.110 µm steps were acquired using a piezo, typically 150–200 planes per image. For the critical period mice expressing tdTomato, the 563 laser was used to photobleach the tdTomato signal prior to imaging the engulfment. To confirm that critical period mice injected with CCN1–HA, we confirmed viral vector expression with half the sections on each slide that were stained with rabbit anti-HA. The WFA channel (647) was imaged with an excitation beamsplitter of 488/561/633 and an emission filter set of 570–620 bandpass and 645 longpass. The CD68 channel (594) was imaged with an excitation beamsplitter of 488/594 and an emission filter set of 420–480 bandpass and 495–620 bandpass. The IBA1 channel (488) was imaged with an excitation beamsplitter of 488/561/633 and an emission filter set of 420–480 bandpass and 495–550 bandpass. Laser power for acquisition was kept the same across experiments. Images were processed by Airyscan in automatic mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For microglia morphology analysis, the same microscope was used as for the engulfment assay but in normal confocal mode. Images were acquired at 16-bit depth using a 20× objective with a pixel dwell time of 2.05 µs. The scaling per pixel was 0.21 µm × 0.21 µm. &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-stacks at 2 µm steps were taken and the visual cortex was tiled at 15% overlap. Number of tiles remained consistent between experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For analysis of newly differentiated oligodendrocytes (BCAS1-labelled oligodendrocytes) and myelin (MBP levels), a Zeiss LSM 900 was used. Images were acquired at 16-bit depth, 2,392 × 2,456 resolution using a 20× objective with a pixel dwell time of 0.41 µs. The scaling per pixel was 0.124 µm × 0.124 µm. &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-stacks at 1 µm steps were taken and the visual cortex was tiled at 10% overlap. Four times two tiles were acquired (total eight tiles).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec50"&gt;Image analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;All image analysis of the smFISH in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt;-cKO validation in Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig8"&gt;3k&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig9"&gt;4h&lt;/a&gt; was performed in ImageJ using a custom macro developed in the laboratory. The &lt;i&gt;Slc1a3&lt;/i&gt; signal was thresholded and used to segment astrocyte regions of interest (ROI). The &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt; probe signal was also thresholded and the total area within each astrocyte ROI was quantified. Thresholds were kept the same within experiments (for example, images acquired on the same day).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For quantification of the immunohistochemistry validating the viral vectors, the cell counter plug-in in ImageJ was used to count the number of transduced cells. For quantifying astrocyte GFAP level in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig8"&gt;3h,i&lt;/a&gt;, GFAP signal was thresholded equally in each pair of mice (tdT versus CCN1) and total area was quantified and compared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To quantify the PNN around parvalbumin-expressing (PV) cells, a custom ROI detection pipeline was developed in CellProfiler. The PV channel intensity was rescaled in order to use the full intensity range to increase the brightness of the image for ROI selection. Both channels had a gaussian filter with a sigma of 1 applied. In order to reduce image heterogeneity and optimize ROI detection, the lower quartile of pixel intensity values were subtracted from the WFA and PV channels. ROIs were manually curated and added or removed. Finalized WFA and PV ROIs were then overlaid with the original, unprocessed images and the integrated density of WFA or PV per ROI was obtained. To separately quantify only WFA that surrounded PV cells, ROIs were overlaid and excluded if overlap was absent. The overlapping ROIs were overlaid with the original, unprocessed images and the integrated density per ROI was obtained. Values were exported to a csv file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For oligodendrocyte and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), the cell counter plug-in in ImageJ was used to count the number of positive cells labelled by the different markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For analysis of microglia engulfment, images were analysed using pyclesperanto in the Napari viewer (&lt;a href="https://github.com/clEsperanto/napari_pyclesperanto_assistant"&gt;https://github.com/clEsperanto/napari_pyclesperanto_assistant&lt;/a&gt;). In brief, the WFA, IBA1 and CD68 channels were independently segmented. A gaussian filter followed by a gamma correction at 1.5 were applied to the WFA signal prior to thresholding using the Otsu method. The IBA1 and CD68 signals were thresholded using the Otsu method. However, for critical period mice, for the CD68 signal the manual thresholding value was set to 900 instead of using the Otsu method due to differences in the CD68 signal in critical period aged mice. The overlapping regions (WFA + CD68 + IBA1 and CD68 + IBA1) were generated using the segmentations and saved as tiff files. To extract volumes of the segmentations, the tiff files were analysed in ImageJ using the 3D Object Counter plug-in and using the same thresholding for all images (Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig11"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig14"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec51"&gt;Microglia morphological classification&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For microglia morphology analysis, images were processed in a custom ImageJ macro and analysed using a custom CellProfiler pipeline. In ImageJ, the contrast for each image was normalized so that at least 70% of the pixels are saturated, and the image was despeckled to remove noise. The pia and white matter were excluded from analysis to standardize the microglia morphology in each image. Then, in CellProfiler, the EnhanceOrSuppressFeatures module was used to suppress feature sizes of ten to segment soma from processes. The soma was identified as the primary object via the adaptive two-class Otsu thresholding method (threshold smoothing scale: 1, threshold correction factor: 1, size of adaptive window: 100). Soma area was measured using the MeasureObjectSizeShape module. The non-suppressed image underwent a gaussian filter (sigma 1) and thresholded using the global robust background method (averaging method: mean, variance method: standard deviation, no. of deviations: 0.8, threshold smoothing scale: 1, threshold correction factor: 0.9). From the thresholded image, secondary objects (processes) were identified via propagation from the overlaid primary objects (soma) using the adaptive two-class Otsu thresholding method (threshold smoothing scale: 0.3, threshold correction factor: 1, size of adaptive window: 10, regularization factor: 1). Microglia that had processes touching the borders of the image were excluded from analysis to remove artificial decreases in measurements. The MorphologicalSkeleton module was used to generate skeletons within the processes, and the MeasureObjectSkeleton module quantified number of trunks, non-truck branches, and total skeleton length of each microglia. Average branch length was calculated by dividing the total skeleton length by the sum of the number of trunk and non-trunk branches. All measurements were converted to microns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For microglial morphology clustering analysis, Python sci-kit learn was used to scale and perform dimensionality reduction on all the extracted morphology features using principal component analysis (PCA). The number of components was chosen as the minimum number that explained 80% of the variance. Then, k-means clustering was performed and the elbow method was used to minimize the within cluster sum of squares. The number of chosen clusters was four for both critical period and adult mice, which is in line with the literature&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Choi, S. et al.

Animals were deeply anaesthetized by injection with Avertin and decapitated. The brain was removed, hemi-sected, and cut into 300 µm coronal sections using a Leica VT1000s vibratome. The brain dissection was performed in cold, sucrose-based dissection solution consisting of (in mM): 2.5 KCl, 7.0 MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1.25 Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 11 glucose, 234 sucrose, 0.50 CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and 24 NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and equilibrated with carbogen (95% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Slices were then placed in a recovery chamber containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) consisting of (in mM): 126 NaCl, 26 NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 1.25 Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1 MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 25 glucose, and saturated with carbogen. Slices recovered for 30 min at 34 °C and were then maintained at room temperature until recordings were performed for 4–6 h after slicing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec54"&gt;Electrophysiology&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slices were placed in a recording chamber and perfused with a recirculating bath of carbogen-saturated aCSF maintained at 31 °C. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were obtained from neurons in layer 2/3 of the injected binocular zone that were visualized using IR-DIC on a Scientifica microscope. Open pipette resistances were 2–5 MΩ (borosilicate glass pipette; Harvard Apparatus 30-0057). Recordings were performed using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). All recordings were sampled at 10 kHz. For measuring the cell membrane properties, data were filtered at 10 kHz and measurements for analysis were taken 5 min after patching onto the cell. Recordings were discarded if the series resistances were &amp;gt;25 MΩ or changed &amp;gt;25% during the entire recording. For each mouse, 1–5 cells were recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For experiments recording sEPSCs and sIPSCs at P27–28, sEPSCs were recorded in voltage clamp holding the cell at −60 mV and sIPSCs were recorded at +0 mV. Five minutes after breaking into the cell, cell membrane properties were measured as described above at −60 mV. sEPSCs were then recorded for 5 min with a filter of 2 kHz and a gain of 10 to allow the detection of small events and then the cell membrane properties were recorded again as described above. The holding voltage was then set to +0 mV to record sIPSCs for 5 min, filtered at 2 kHz and with a gain of 10. After recording sIPSCs, the holding voltage was set back to −60 mV to measure the membrane properties again. For each cell, sEPSCs or sIPSCs were excluded if series resistances changed &amp;gt;25% before and after recording or if cell seal was inadequate. Thus, for some cells, both sEPSCs and sIPSCs were analysed but for others only sEPSCs or sIPSCs were analysed. A caesium methanesulfonate internal was used (in mM): 100 caesium methanesulfonate, 20 KCl, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP, 10 Na-phosphocreatine, 3 QX 314 Chloride (Tocris 2313). Osmolarity and pH of the internal solutions were adjusted to 290–310 mOsm and pH 7.3–7.4 with double-distilled water and with CsOH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For experiments recording sEPSCs from pyramidal and fast-spiking cells at P33–34, aCSF containing 40 µM bicuculline methochloride (Tocris 0131) was washed in. sEPSCs were recorded at −70 mV for 5 min and were filtered at 2 kHz and acquired at a gain of 10 to allow the detection of small events. Fast-spiking cells were confirmed as fast-spiking with little-to-no spike-frequency adaptation by injecting a 100 ms current step and noting the frequency and AP width in current-clamp mode. Additionally, fast-spiking neurons had a low input resistance (&amp;lt;150 MΩ) and multipolar morphology&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Sancho, L. &amp;amp; Bloodgood, B.

The apparatus consisted of an open field behaviour box with clear walls and bottom. The arena was 40 cm × 40 cm and placed on the edge of a 1-m-tall table with half the box extended out over the table. A black and white checkboard mat was placed on the bench top and dropped down to the floor and extended out to create the ‘cliff’. A lamp was placed directly over the box to provide 30 lux of light but oriented to prevent any reflections on the plexiglass bottom. A camera was placed directly overhead pointed down at the arena and connected to AnyMaze tracking software. Mice were brought to the room 1 h prior to testing for habituation. The mouse’s movements were tracked during the duration of the entire 5 min trial. Measurements were binned by 1 min intervals. The arena was cleaned with Virkon followed by RO water between each mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec57"&gt;In vivo two-photon imaging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec58"&gt;Two-photon calcium imaging&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recordings and habituation were performed during the 12 h light cycle. After recovery from viral injection and cranial window implantation, mice were habituated to handling and head fixation on a linear treadmill (LabMaker) over the course of one week. Imaging was performed during the day cycle of the mouse. We used a custom-built two-photon laser scanning microscope from Neurolabware equipped with a pulsed femtosecond Ti:Sapphire laser (Chameleon Vision II, Coherent) controlled by Scanbox acquisition software. The laser was tuned to 920 nm for imaging gCaMP6f and focused through a 16× water-immersion objective (Nikon, 0.8 numerical aperture). Images were acquired at a frequency of 15.5 Hz at a depth of 150–300 µm below the pial surface for layer 2/3. Images were 512 × 796 pixels (500 × 600 µm). A rotary encoder was used to track the running speed of the mice on the linear treadmill. A camera fitted with a 740 nm longpass filter was used to track pupil diameter during imaging (Mako U-015B). Both the encoder and the pupil camera were triggered at the scanning frame rate. To measure the responses of neurons to presentation of visual stimuli to either eye independently, an opaque eye path was placed in front of the other, non-imaged eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec59"&gt;Binocular zone confirmation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imaged areas that were stereotaxically identified during cranial window implantation (see above) as the binocular zone were confirmed as such by performing retinotopic mapping. A BENQ LCD 27-inch monitor (60 Hz refresh rate) was used for visual stimulus presentation, was placed 20 cm from the eyes, and covered approximately 113° in azimuth and 60° in elevation. Stimuli were designed in PsychoPy 2.22 and custom code was written to enable communication between the stimulus computer and the imaging computer. Stimulus presentation onset was tracked using a photodiode (Thorlabs, FDS1010) that was fed to an Arduino UNO rev. 3 and generated a transistor-transistor logic (TTL) pulse that was sampled by the imaging computer and time-stamped with the imaged frame. To confirm that the imaged area was indeed binocular, small checkerboard stimuli were presented pseudo-randomly at 15 neighbouring positions at a rate of 3 Hz. Stimuli were presented to either eye independently and randomly and regions were considered binocular if the peak responses in both eyes were evoked by stimuli presented in the central, upper visual field (−20° to +20° azimuth relative to the midline)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 33" title="Mrsic-Flogel, T.

The stimuli consisted of 16 directions (from 0° to 337.5°) and 2 spatial frequencies (0.03 and 0.13 cycles per degree) at 80% contrast. They were generated in PsychoPy 2.22. The full stimulus set was presented 5 times in one experiment in pseudo-random sequence. Gratings drifted at 1 Hz for 2 s, followed by a 4 s grey screen. Stimulus presentation onset was tracked using a photodiode and TTL pulses were generated and sampled by the imaging microscope to synchronize stimulation and imaging data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec61"&gt;Analysis&lt;/h4&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;Scanbox.sbx files were converted to tiff format and motion-corrected and segmented using Suite2p in Python (&lt;a href="https://github.com/MouseLand/suite2p"&gt;https://github.com/MouseLand/suite2p&lt;/a&gt;). The files from the contralateral and ipsilateral eye stimulation were aligned together to ensure the same cells were segmented. Files from different days were aligned and segmented separately. Rigid and non-rigid registration were run. After automated cell detection, the registered binary was manually checked and additional ROIs were drawn if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;The ODI of individual neurons was calculated as the ratio between the difference and the sum of the mean Δ&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;stimulus-peak&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt; in response to the ipsilateral or contralateral eye experimentally determined preferred drifting direction: ODI = (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; − &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)/(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;), where &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the contralateral eye response to its preferred direction, and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is the ipsilateral eye response to its preferred direction. An ODI of −1 or +1 indicates ipsilateral or contralateral eye dominance, respectively. The stimulus-triggered response, Δ&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;stimulus-peak&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;, was calculated by subtracting the mean Δ&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt; for the 16 frames prior to stimulus presentation from the mean Δ&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt; 7 to 31 frames (0.5 s to 2 s) after stimulus presentation (averaged 4 frames around the peak). Only neurons that were longitudinally tracked and responsive across imaging sessions were used for ODI calculations. For Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig3"&gt;3m&lt;/a&gt;, we used data only from longitudinally tracked neurons and binned the cells on the basis of their pre-MD ODI. We made 8 bins and calculated the median change in the binned cells’ contralateral eye responses and ipsilateral eye responses.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar13"&gt;Orientation tuning&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;The preferred orientation of a neuron was calculated as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ1" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\mathrm{Orientation}=\arctan (({\Sigma }_{n}{{\rm{O}}}_{n}\times {{\rm{e}}}^{2i{\rm{\pi }}\theta }/180)/2)$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the peak neuronal response to the 18 different orientations (0° to 170° spaced every 18°). &lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt; is the orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Global orientation selectivity was calculated as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ2" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$\mathrm{Circular}\,\mathrm{variance}=1-|({\Sigma }_{n}{{\rm{O}}}_{n}\times {{\rm{e}}}^{2i{\rm{\pi }}\theta }/180)/{\Sigma }_{n}{{\rm{O}}}_{n}|.$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Cardinal proportions were calculated as the proportion of neurons having an orientation preference to 0° or 90°, ± 11.25°.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Binocular matching for binocular neurons was quantified as the absolute difference in preferred orientation of the contralateral and the ipsilateral eyes. &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\Delta {\rm{Orientation}}=|{{\rm{Ori}}}_{{\rm{contra}}}-{{\rm{Ori}}}_{{\rm{ipsi}}}|\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar14"&gt;Spiking correlations&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Using Suite2p, the deconvolved spike train was extracted from each cell. An unconstrained non-negative deconvolution using exponential kernels was used. The kernel decay timescale was set to 1.0 and a gaussian filter with a smoothing constant of 10 was applied to the neuropil subtracted fluorescence trace. The neuropil subtraction coefficient was set to 0.7. The spiking activity of each pair of significantly responsive, longitudinally tracked neurons was calculated by concatenating the spiking activity for all trial-on periods and performing a pairwise Pearson’s correlation. This was done independently for contralateral and ipsilateral eye responses.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;p&gt;For all responsive, longitudinally tracked neurons, the response reliability was calculated by the coefficient of variation (cv = &lt;i&gt;σ&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;) of the neuron across all trials of each unique stimulus condition. &lt;i&gt;σ&lt;/i&gt; is the standard deviation of the neuron’s responses to all trials of a specific stimulus and &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt; is the mean of the trial responses.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar16"&gt;Longitudinal imaging&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To locate the same imaging plane for longitudinal imaging, we used the images acquired on previous days as reference, such as the vascular map of the brain surface acquired with the PCO camera and epifluorescence and the mean motion-corrected two-photon fluorescence images. The angle of the objective was kept the same. Fine adjustment of imaging depth and &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; location was performed using the Scanbox built-in plug-in searchref. In brief, a &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-stack was automatically acquired and projected onto the mean motion-correct image from the prior imaging. The plug-in computes (using fast Fourier transform) the optimal translation of the microscope and moves the scope to best align the images (&lt;a href="https://scanbox.org/2019/07/18/scanbox-searches-for-a-population/"&gt;https://scanbox.org/2019/07/18/scanbox-searches-for-a-population/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
                
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar17"&gt;Longitudinal cell tracking&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;To track cells across multiple imaging sessions across different days, roiMatchPub.m, a MATLAB package written by A. Ranson was used (&lt;a href="https://github.com/ransona/ROIMatchPub"&gt;https://github.com/ransona/ROIMatchPub&lt;/a&gt;). In brief, the package uses a control point-based affine geometric transformation to correct for the plane rotation. The transformation is then applied to the image from the second imaging time point (‘post MD’). The overlap of ROIs between the mask file from the reference image and the transformed mask file from the second imaging time point is calculated. Overlapping ROIs were considered as longitudinally tracked after visual inspection and verification (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig12"&gt;7d,e&lt;/a&gt;). The average percentage of cells that were segmented before MD that were longitudinally tracked and also segmented post MD was 46 ± 6% (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig12"&gt;7f&lt;/a&gt;). For naive mice, the average percentage of cells that were longitudinally tracked from day 1 to day 6 of imaging was 26 ± 3.0% for wild-type mice and 35.9 ± 9.2% for &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt;-cKO mice (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig13"&gt;8j&lt;/a&gt;). The difference in number of neurons that were longitudinally tracked between the two genotypes, combined with a lower number of mice in the wild-type naive condition, could account for the difference in the unresponsive number of neurons for all segmented cells versus longitudinally tracked unresponsive neurons (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig13"&gt;8d,j,k&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;For experiments looking at cell proportions (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig3"&gt;3d–j&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig12"&gt;7g–l&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig13"&gt;8a–h&lt;/a&gt;), we used cells that were longitudinally tracked but not necessarily responsive, as we were also interested in cells that were unresponsive and became responsive after MD or vice versa.

Sampling was performed 10,000 times for the dataset. A sample was taken with replacement at the first level (mice) with the sample size being equal to the number of mice. Then, a sample was taken with replacement at the second level, the neurons imaged. We chose a sample size of 100 which was slightly larger than the maximum number of neurons imaged per mouse. We reported the median across the 10,000 samples and directly calculated a &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;boot&lt;/sub&gt;) that represents the probability that the mean ODI of the pre-MD group is larger than that of the post-MD group. The &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;boot&lt;/sub&gt; was used to determine statistically significant differences for the pre-MD and post-MD samples. For the bootstrapping analysis in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig3"&gt;3m&lt;/a&gt;, inset, we used the bootci function in MATLAB for 1,000 samples for each of the pre-MD ODI bins. We calculated the mean for these 1,000 samples and a 95% confidence interval.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar19"&gt;Locomotion analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Spiking data for each trial were extracted as described above. Locomotion data was obtained from the Scanbox quadrature file. Locomotion was converted to speed during each trial. Correlations between speed and spiking for all trials per responsive, longitudinally tracked cell were calculated using pairwise Spearman correlations to account for any non-normality in the locomotion data.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec62"&gt;Statistical analysis and reproducibility&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most experiments, analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism (v.8.4.3 and v.10), with &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values calculated to four decimal points. For WFA and PV quantifications, two-photon in vivo imaging data, and microglial morphology analyses were run in MATLAB (MathWorks) and Python. Significance was set at &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; = 0.05. Data were tested for normality, and two-tailed parametric or non-parametric tests were run as appropriate. Tests were corrected for multiple comparisons using either the Tukey or Sidak method for two-way ANOVA. For nested ANOVA for the electrophysiology, Tukey’s correction for multiple comparisons was used. For non-parametric multiple comparisons, the Dunn method was applied. Adjusted &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values are shown. For the majority of statistical tests presented, the adjusted &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values corrected for multiple comparisons are shown. For chi-square tests of proportions done in MATLAB, a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used to calculate the corrected &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; threshold (corrected &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; = 0.05/number of comparisons). For chi-square tests in Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig12"&gt;7g&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09770-w#Fig13"&gt;8a–h&lt;/a&gt;, unadjusted &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values are shown, with significance indicated based on Bonferroni-corrected &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;. For Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests of locomotion modulation the unadjusted &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value is shown, with significance indicated based on Bonferroni-corrected &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;. For Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests, the unadjusted &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value is shown, with significance indicated based on Bonferroni-corrected &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;. For microglia morphology, bulk RNA-sequencing and snRNA-seq analyses, R studio was also used.

Each experiment was repeated a minimum of two times. No data were excluded from analyses unless viral injection was off-target or if electrophysiology recordings had series resistances that were &amp;gt;25 MΩ or changed &amp;gt; 25% during the entire recording.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec63"&gt;Data presentation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure legends indicate whether mean and s.e.m. or median and the 95% confidence interval are shown. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values are shown to 2 significant figures, except in the case of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001 or &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.9999.

As people age, their ability to produce T cells wanes, and the ones they have become less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;T-cell ageing helps to explain why vaccines are sometimes less effective in older people than in young adults, and why cancer treatments that unleash the immune system against tumours don’t work as well in older adults, says María Mittelbrunn, an immunologist at the Spanish National Research Council in Madrid. Flagging T-cell immunity is also linked to the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02788-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02788-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; associated with many age-related diseases, including some forms of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00871-6" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04082-5/d41586-025-04082-5_26916752.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How to make an old immune system young again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;“T cells, in particular, are one of the cell types that change the most during ageing,” says Mittelbrunn, who was not involved in the study. “To rejuvenate them could have immense consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was reported in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; on 17 December and earlier this month at the American Society of Hematology annual meeting in Orlando, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Targeting T cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;T cells are produced in the bone marrow and then travel to a tiny gland called the thymus to mature. In the thymus, they learn to recognize and respond to pathogens such as bacteria or viruses. They also learn not to attack the body’s own healthy cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the thymus degrades with age: it begins to shrink and is gradually replaced by fatty tissue. Attempts to reverse this using hormone treatments or other drugs have not worked, says Mirco Friedrich, a haematologist and oncologist at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, and first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, Friedrich and his colleagues decided to take a different approach: rather than directly treating the thymus, they targeted T cells by delivering an experimental therapy to the liver. “Most T cells are in the blood,” Friedrich says. “And the liver receives the body’s whole blood volume.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00566-6" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04082-5/d41586-025-04082-5_50778868.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How quickly are you ageing?

A set of 20 nylon Semmes Weinstein monofilaments was used for testing. In brief, a fibre was gently pushed against the surface of the skin from below. Filaments of increasing stiffness (0.02–2.0 g) were applied perpendicularly to the plantar surface of the hind paw with sufficient force to cause slight bending and held for 2–3 s. A withdrawal response is categorized as an indicator of nociception and is defined as paw withdrawal, paw lifting, paw rotation, sniffing, licking, scratching, shaking or rapid movement, was recorded, and subsequent filament selection followed the up-down paradigm.

Overlap between IBA1 and marker surfaces (≤0.5 μm distance) was used to determine the proportion of microglia that were marker-positive. Similarly, overlap of marker-positive surfaces that were within an IBA1 surface (≤0.5 μm: TREM2, PLIN2, BODIPY, FluroMyelin, SMI32) determined the volume of marker present within microglia. Measurements were normalized to the total volume to IBA1 microglia and measurements were restricted to the spinal cord dorsal white matter unless stated otherwise. For YAP1 analysis, 3D surfaces were generated for all DAPI&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; nuclei, YAP1, &lt;i&gt;Gfap/Slc1a3&lt;/i&gt; mRNA and &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. Astrocyte nucelli were determined by setting the overlap volume of DAPI and &lt;i&gt;Gfap/Slc1a3&lt;/i&gt; to 15. Astrocytes nuclei expressing &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt; were those containing an overlap volume of &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt; greater than 0.16. Finally, the YAP1 expression within the &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt;+ and &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;−&lt;/i&gt; astrocytes was the volume of YAP1 (&amp;lt;0 μm) within these &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt;+ &lt;i&gt;or Ccn1&lt;/i&gt;− astrocyte nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec30"&gt;Spatiotemporal analysis of &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt;+ astrocytes and microglial nodules&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regional quantification of &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt;+ astrocytes and IBA1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglial nodules was performed on 10× image tiles of transverse spinal cord sections using the cell counter plugin (Fiji). Transverse sections were only evaluated if they appeared cytoarchitecturally intact with normal-appearing white and grey matter anatomy. Initially, 8 anatomical reference points were used to align transverse spinal cord images: central canal; top of the dorsal white matter; bottom of the dorsal white matter; left and right lateral white matter; top and bottom of the central grey matter; the left and right sides of the central grey matter; the top of the dorsal horn grey matter on left and right sides, and the bottom of the ventral horns on left and right sides. For injured samples, the side containing the majority of &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt;+ astrocytes or microglial nodules was labelled as left (ipsilesional). Next, &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt;+ astrocytes were quantified as &lt;i&gt;Gfap&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;Slc1a3&lt;/i&gt; containing nuclei that contained at least 3 &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA puncta (RNAscope). Similarly, microglial nodules were quantified as closely associated clusters of microglia containing more than three microglial nuclei&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Safaiyan, S. et al.

At least two sections were quantified per mouse. &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt;+ astrocytes and microglia nodule counts from different tissue sections were aligned to a common coordinate system using a custom python script. First, all reference and cell coordinates were linearly shifted such that the central canal was set at (0,0). The average of each reference point across all sections per spinal region were used to define a template spinal section which was then used to perform non-rigid transformation (ThinPlateSplineShapeTransformer from the OpenCV2 library) of all cell coordinates. For visualization, &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt; astrocyte/microglia counts were spatially binned per section using a 2D histogram (bin area 19.35 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and counts per bin were averaged per mouse and then per condition. The resulting cell count per bin was then plotted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For statistical comparison of time-dependent differences in WDM nodule formation between wild-type and &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt;-cKO mice, we employed a Conway–Maxwell–Poisson (COM–Poisson) generalized linear mixed model with a log link and fixed effects for group and time&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 49" title="Guikema, S.

This model was selected to enable robust assessment of how nodule counts change over time in wild-type and &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt;-cKO mice, and whether these changes differ by genotype. The COM–Poisson distribution accommodates both overdispersion and underdispersion in count data and accounts for the repeated-measures structure of the dataset, wherein multiple tissue sections were analysed per biological replicate at each post-injury time point. The model included fixed effects for group (&lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt;-cKO versus wild type), time (7, 28 and 90 dpi), and a random intercept for each mouse to account for within-subject clustering. The group-by-time interaction was formally tested using a likelihood ratio test comparing nested models with and without the interaction term. Post hoc pairwise comparisons of group (genotype) and time levels were conducted on the basis of model-derived estimated marginal means, with multiple testing adjustment using Tukey’s method. All hypothesis tests were two-sided with a significance level set at 5%. These statistical analyses were performed using R software (v.4.4.1).

In brief, fresh frozen spinal cord tissue was homogenized and haemagglutinin (HA) immunoprecipitation was carried out to purify of astrocyte ribosome-associated mRNA. Astrocyte RNA integrity was analysed using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent) with the RNA Pico chip, with RNA integrity number (RIN)  ≥  8 for all samples. RNA concentration was determined using the RiboGreen RNA Assay kit (Life Technologies). cDNA was generated from 10 ng of RNA using the Universal plus mRNA-seq Kit (Nugen). The workflow consisted of poly(A) RNA selection, RNA fragmentation and double-stranded cDNA synthesis using a mixture of random and oligo(dT) priming, followed by end repair to generate blunt ends, adaptor ligation, strand selection and PCR amplification to produce the final library. Multiplexed sequencing was performed using the NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina) on a NovaSeq S2 flow cell to produce 50 bp paired-end reads. Data quality was assessed using Illumina SAV and demultiplexing was performed using Illumina Bcl2fastq2 v.2.17. Sequences were aligned to the mouse mm10 genome using STAR aligner (v.2.4.0j). Average percent of uniquely mapped reads was 79 (±8.7)%. Read counts were determined using HT-seq (v.0.6.0). At least 4, and in most cases 6 samples were evaluated per experimental condition. Genes not expressed in minimum of 10 samples (5 counts or more) or average fragments per kilobase per million mapped fragments (FPKM) below 0.75 were filtered out from further analysis. Differential expression analysis (DEA) was conducted using the Bioconductor EdgeR package (v.3.6). DEGs were determined using FDR at 5%. To identify co-regulated astrocyte-enriched genes across time after injury, a gene-gene correlation matrix was constructed using genes that were significantly enriched in astrocytes with a logFC &amp;gt;1 and FDR &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.05 at any time point. Astrocyte-enriched gene expression was identified by comparing astrocyte HA immunoprecipitation-derived ribosome-associated mRNA to whole-tissue mRNA (HA immunoprecipitation input-derived mRNA). Astrocyte versus whole-tissue DEA identified 1249 astrocyte-enriched DEGs, which were used as input for a spearman correlation using log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FC changes values from iSCI versus healthy DEA and kmeans clustered into 11 gene modules. Genes in each module were used as input into gene ontology (GO) using Enrichr (GO_Biological Process_2018 database).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LRA gene expression data were compared to multiple other spinal cord astrocyte transcriptomics data sets from SCI and other non-traumatic CNS insults and disorders: BFAs&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 17" title="O’Shea, T.

A composite list of DEGs (log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fold change versus healthy) across all datasets was compiled (9,558 DEGs) and used for all downstream analyses. Principal component analysis was performed as a descriptive visualization of global relationships across datasets, in conjunction with gene-level analyses of DEG overlaps, directionality, and functional groups. Together, these complementary approaches allowed us to assess both overall transcriptomic relationships and specific gene-level distinctions. For comparison between LRAs and BFAs, LRA 3 and 7 dpi were compared to BFA 2 and 5 dpi, respectively. DEG information was available for 14 and 28 dpi in both datasets. These data were used to tabulate the proportion of LRA DEGs that were either also significantly upregulated, downregulated, oppositely regulated, or not regulated in BFAs at each time point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec34"&gt;Nuclei isolation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;iSCI mice were perfused with ice-cold PBS with heparin at 3, 7 or 28 dpi, spinal cords dissected out and 3 mm of spinal cord rostral (T9–T11) and caudal (L1–L3) to the lesion epicentre were then rapidly removed, snap-frozen in dry ice and stored at −80 °C. An anatomically equivalent region of spinal cord (T11–L1) was isolated from age- and genotype-matched healthy controls.

Samples were loaded to capture 10,000 nuclei per sample. During library preparation, the initial cDNA amplification was run for 13 cycles, which was found to be optimal for 10,000 nuclei. Following library preparation, quantitative PCR was run to quantify library concentration and samples were pooled to equivalent concentrations. Initially, a shallow sequencing run of the pooled libraries at ~20% sequencing saturation, the results of which informed library re-pooling in order to normalize nuclei number within the libraries to obtain ~40,000 reads per cell. Sequencing was performed by NovaSeq (Illumina) at 2 × 150 base pair reads at 150 pM (average reads per sample: mean: 2.9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; ± 1.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec36"&gt;snRNA-seq data analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Output FASTQ files for each sample were aligned with CellRanger v.6.0.2 using the mm10-2020-A reference genome for each sample.

Visium slides were pre-chilled in a cryostat (Leica) for 30 min at the time of sectioning. Two 10-μm sections were taken from lesion-remote rostral (T9–T11) and caudal (L1–L3) blocks, equivalent to samples analysed by snRNA-seq. Samples were processed using the Visium Spatial Gene Expression Reagent Kit (10X Genomics) per the manufacturer’s established protocol. cDNA libraries were pooled in a NovaSeq6000 SP v.1.0 flowcell and paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 sequencer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec38"&gt;Spatial transcriptomics analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spots overlaying tissue sections were manually annotated in the Loupe (10X Genomics) and processed by spaceranger-v.1.3.0 and aligned against the mm10 reference genome mm10-2020-A. Haematoxylin and eosin staining of transverse spinal cord sections was used to manually annotate lateral white, ventral white, dorsal white, central grey, dorsal horn and ventral horn. Additionally, gene expression of inflammation and gliosis-associated genes was used to distinguish lesion ipsilateral and contralateral sides. Quality control thresholding resulted in 14,566 spots across 16 biological replicates (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 4 mice per group; 2 sections per rostral and caudal block). Data were normalized to 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; counts and log-transformed before running principal component analysis and UMAP projection. To accommodate for morphological variation, a non-rigid transformation was applied (ThinPlateSplineShapeTransformer from the OpenCV2 library) using manually placed neuroanatomical reference points, in a manner equivalent to aligned average density plot construction for &lt;i&gt;Ccn1&lt;/i&gt;+ astrocyte and WDM nodules counts. Tissue alignment was validated by examination of known spatially restricted gene expression (for example, &lt;i&gt;Mbp&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Syp&lt;/i&gt;). Cell2location was used to spatially integrate snRNA-seq subclusters and spatial transcriptomics data&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 60" title="Kleshchevnikov, V. et al.

The top 30 highest expressed genes from each dataset, mitochondrial genes, and genes expressed in &amp;lt;5% of cells or spots and with mean &amp;lt;1.12 were filtered out to generate snRNA-seq input. Cell2location was run with the following parameters: (batch_key= “Date library prep”, continuous_covariates = “total_counts”, categorical_covariates = “User”, N_cells_per_location=12, detection_alpha=200) and trained for 40,000 epochs. The cell2location matrix was used as input for NMF to identify spatially co-occurring cell types. NMF from sklearn was run with the following parameters: (n_components=8, alpha=0.9,max_iter=1000, shuffle=True, init = “nndsvda”,l1_ratio=0.9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec39"&gt;Microglial isolation (lipidomic and culture)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were perfused with ice-cold PBS with heparin and the brain and spinal cord were freshly dissected following. For iSCI mice, 1 mm rostral and caudal to the lesion epicentre was removed and discarded, and the injured lateral side of the spinal cord (rostral and caudal to the lesion) was collected for microglial isolation. Dissected tissue was minced with a sterile razor blade and then dissociated using the Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (P) (Miltenyi Biotech) and the GentelMACS dissociator with heaters per the manufacturer’s instructions. Following dissociation, samples were filtered through a 70-μm strainer, and myelin was depleted using Myelin removal beads II (Miltenyi Biotech) and the AutoMACS separator. Finally, microglia were isolated by incubating samples with CD11b microbeads (Milteyni) and isolating with the AutoMACS per the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell number was then determined before proceeding to downstream applications (lipidomics and culture).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec40"&gt;Microglial bulk RNA-seq and analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 50 μl spot drop containing 50,000 microglia cells was seeded into the desired wells of a 24-well plate. Cells were cultured for 7 days, with a full media change given on day 1 followed by half media change on day 4. On day 7, cells were either left untreated or treated with CCN1 (Peprotech: 120-25) at 50 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or vehicle (BSA) for 24 h. Each condition was carried out in triplicate for each experiment. Cells were then removed using a cell scraper, replicates pooled, and then processed for RNA isolation using RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen, 74034). Microglia RNA samples were prepared for analysis by RNA-seq. RNA integrity was analysed using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent) with the RNA Pico chip, with RIN  ≥  9.6 for all samples. RNA concentration was determined using the RiboGreen RNA Assay. Multiplexed paired-end sequencing was performed using the NovaSeq X Plus sequencer (Illumina). Data quality was assessed using Illumina SAV and demultiplexing was performed using Illumina Bcl2fastq2. Sequences were aligned to the mouse mm39 genome using STAR aligner (v.2.7.11b). DEA was conducted using EdgeR with a FDA of 5%. DEGs were defined with a log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-transformed fold change threshold of 0.25 and adjusted &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.05 (CCN1 stimulation versus vehicle).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec41"&gt;Microglia lipid efflux and lipid droplet content evaluation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary microglia isolated from male and female mice 8–12 weeks of age were seeded at 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cells per well in a flat-bottom 96-well plate coated with poly-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;-lysine (0.01%, Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were grown in microglia media (10% fetal bovine serum, 1× penicillin-streptomycin, 10 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; carrier-free (CF) recombinant mouse GM-CSF, 10 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; CF recombinant mouse M-CSF, 10 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; CF recombinant human TGFβ1, in DMEM/F-12 Ham) for 4 days at 37 °C, 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with full media change after 24 h. Microglia cholesterol efflux was assessed using a Fluorometric Cholesterol Efflux Assay Kit (Abcam; ab196985) following the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, on day 4 microglia were loaded with fluorescent cholesterol for one hour, then placed into equilibration media containing CCN1 (50 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in 0.1%BSA) or vehicle (0.1% BSA) for 16 h. Following incubation, cells were washed with phenol red-free DMEM/F-12 Ham and incubated with cholesterol acceptor solution (2% (2-Hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin) for 6 h. Plates were then centrifuged for 2 min at 1,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; and the cell supernatant was collected for fluorometric analysis of cholesterol content. Meanwhile, adherent cells were lysed and processed for fluorometric cholesterol content within the cell. Fluorometric measurements were performed using Varioskan LUX (ThermoFisher) (excitation/emission, 485/523 nm). Per cent cholesterol efflux was then calculated for each sample by dividing relative fluorescence unit (RFU) of the supernatant by the total cholesterol content (RFU of supernatant plus cell lysate). The effect of treatment was then calculated by subtracting the percent cholesterol efflux of the negative control (no cholesterol acceptor) from the percent cholesterol efflux of treatment (CCN1 or vehicle), followed by normalization with the percent cholesterol efflux of vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For microglial lipid storage analysis, primary microglia were seeded at 500,000 cells per well in 6-well plates and cultured for 7 days, with a full media change on day 1 and a half media change on day 4. On day 7, cells were treated with purified recombinant CCN1 (50 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; Peprotech) or vehicle control (BSA) for 22 h. To assess the involvement of SDC4, cells were pre-treated with either SDC4 function-blocking antibodies (Rat Anti-Mouse SDC4 Clone KY/8.2, BD Pharmingen, 550350) or serotype-matched control antibodies (Rat IgG2a kappa Isotype Control, eBioscience, 14-4321-82) (25 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) for 1 h. Media containing antibodies was then washed out and replaced with media containing CCN1. After 22 h, culture media was removed and cells were labelled with LipidTOX Deep Red Neutral Lipid stain (Thermo Scientific, H34477; 1:500 in PBS) for 30 min. Cells were washed with PBS-EDTA, gently dissociated by pipetting, and collected by centrifugation (300&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;, 10 min, 4 °C). Cell pellets were resuspended in 500 µl of flow cytometry buffer (PBS + 5% FBS), stained with DAPI, and analysed on a SONY ID7000 Spectrum Cell Analyzer at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Flow Cytometry Core. FlowJo software was used for downstream analysis.

In brief, the pellets were thawed at 4 °C for 10 min, after which, cold methanol, and HPLC-grade chloroform were added in a ratio of 2:1. The samples were vortexed for 10 s, resulting in a one-phase solution which was then incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. A biphasic solution was then obtained by adding ultrapure water and chloroform in a 1:1 ratio. Next, the samples were centrifuged at 16,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min, giving rise to 3 phases in each tube. The bottom phase in the tube is the organic phase that contains lipids. Next, the solvents from the organic phase were evaporated using SpeedVac vacuum concentrator for 1 h resulting in dried lipid extracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec43"&gt;Unbiased Lipidomics using MRM profiling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dried lipid extracts from microglial cells were reconstituted in 200 µl of a 50:50 methanol:chloroform solution containing 10 mM ammonium formate. Prior to analysis, lipid extracts were further diluted in acetonitrile: methanol 70:30, with 10 mM ammonium formate. The quality control sample was the injection solvent containing 0.02 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of the quantitative mass spectrometry internal standard EquiSPLASH (Avanti Polar Lipids, 330731), which was monitored over time to ensure the instrument’s appropriate operation. All MRM profiling experiments were conducted on an Agilent 6495C triple quadrupole mass spectrometer outfitted with an Agilent 1290 Infinity II LC system and G7167B autosampler. A volume of 8 μl of diluted lipid extract was introduced into the Agilent Jet Stream (AJS) ion source of the mass spectrometer by flow injection for each MRM method.

Microglia lipidomics data are available online at &lt;a href="https://github.com/chopralab/Lesion-remote_astrocytes_govern_microglia-mediated_white_matter_repair"&gt;https://github.com/chopralab/Lesion-remote_astrocytes_govern_microglia-mediated_white_matter_repair&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equ2" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$${\rm{C}}{{\rm{V}}}^{2}({y}_{{ls}})=1/{\mu }_{{ls}}+{\varPhi }_{l}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec45"&gt;CCN1 co-immunoprecipitation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify candidate CCN1 receptors on microglia, a CCN1-directed bait-and-prey approach was used. Co-immunoprecipitation was performed using the Pierce Crosslink Magnetic IP/Co-IP Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 88805) following the manufacturer’s protocol with minor modifications. In brief, 25 µl of protein A/G magnetic beads were resuspended, washed on a magnetic stand, and incubated with 5 µg of anti-DDK for 2 h at 4 °C for conjugation. Beads were incubated with 5 µg IgG isotype control antibodies for negative control. Bead–antibody conjugates were then washed twice with 500 µl of wash buffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEK-293T cells expressing Mouse CCN1 with a DDK–MYC molecular tag (Origene MR221828) were lysed in buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors, followed by centrifugation at 12,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min to remove debris. The cleared lysate was incubated with bead–antibody conjugates overnight at 4 °C on a rotator to allow CCN1 binding. The following day, the beads were washed three times with 500 µl of wash buffer before incubation with microglial lysates. Next, primary microglia were cultured for 7 days then lysed by sonication in sample buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40 (v/v), 0.5% CHAPS (w/v), protease and phosphatase inhibitors, pH 7.4). The whole-cell lysate was then incubated with bead–antibody–CCN1 complexes overnight at 4 °C on a rotator. Bead–antibody–CCN1 complexes were then washed three times with wash buffer and sent to the Cedars-Sinai Proteomics and Metabolomics Core for on-bead digestion and proteomic analysis by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec46"&gt;Sample preparation for proteomics&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samples were lysed in 6 M urea, 1 M ammonium bicarbonate, 5% SDS lysis buffer and sonicated for 10 min at 70% power using a QSonica Q800 sonicator. Samples were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min and protein concentration measured by BCA. Samples were digested by an automated SP3 protocol adapted to a Beckman i7 workstation. Bead aliquoting, reduction, alkylation, digestion, and elution were all performed on-deck with a 96-well plate format. In brief, 50 μg of protein in 40 μl of the previously mentioned lysis buffer was reduced with the addition of 10 μl of 200 mM dithiothreitol and incubated 30 min at 37 °C with shaking at 300 rpm, then alkylated with 10 μl of 400 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature for 15 min in the dark. The volume was brought to 70 μl with Tris-HCl pH 8, then 5 μl of bead suspension (10:1 mass ratio of beads to protein), 1:1 mixture of hydrophilic/hydrophobic beads (Cytiva) was aliquoted into the samples using the span-8 pipetting head with constant agitation of the bead reservoir between transfers. Samples were brought to 50% acetonitrile (ACN) and incubated for 18 min, and then the solvent was removed on-magnet, and samples were rinsed with 2× 80% ethanol then 2× ACN with 200 μl volumes each. After the solvent was completely removed, the samples were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 and 10 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with trypsin at a 1:20 ratio. Samples were bath sonicated for 5 min then incubated 18 h at 37 °C and 1,200 rpm overnight. After digestion, the samples were then removed from beads and brought to 0.1% formic acid and 2% DMSO for injection into the instrument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec47"&gt;LC–MS/MS analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 500 ng of peptides from digested samples were analysed on a Thermo Orbitrap Astral coupled to a NeoVanquish LC. To assess carryover, a blank injection was included after every three injections. Samples were separated using 24 min gradient. The compositions for solvent A and B were 0.1% formic acid in water and 80% ACN with 0.1% formic acid, respectively. The gradient used was as follows: 1.2 μl min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; flow, 0 min 4% B, 2 min 9% B, 13 min 25% B, 17 min 35% B. NeoVanquish LC was operated in direct injection mode, using a 150 μm internal diameter × 15 cm, 1.5 μm PepSep C18 (Bruker) column coupled to a nano source (Thermo EasySpray) on the Orbitrap Astral MS platform (ThermoFisher). All sample runs were acquired in data independent acquisition (DIA) mode from 380 to 980 Da with 240k Orbitrap resolution and 5 ms maximum injection time for MS1. All DIA scans were set to a 7 ms maximum injection time with varying window schemes between 2 and 5 Th depending on gradient length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec48"&gt;Proteomic data analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mass spectrometry raw data files were searched against UniProt mouse reviewed protein sequence entries (accessed April 2023) using DIA-NN (v.1.8.1) (PMID: 31768060) in library-free mode with default parameters. On the basis of recent comparisons with library-based approaches, DIA-NN in library-free mode has been found to produce results that are comparable or better than those of experimental library-based searches while being freely available and was hence chosen for the analysis of all data. (PMID: 36609502). The output protein group matrix from DIA-NN was used to perform downstream analysis using MetaboAnalyst 6.0 (PMID: 38587201). Pairwise comparisons between CCN1 co-immunoprecipitation and negative control antibody co-immunoprecipitation were performed using uncorrected two-sided t-tests, with a significance threshold of −log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;) &amp;gt; 1.3 (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05).

Cortices were dissociated using Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (P) (Miltenyi Biotech) and the GentleMACS dissociator with heaters per the manufacturer’s instructions. Following dissociation, samples were filtered through a 70-μm strainer, and myelin was depleted using 120 μl of Myelin removal beads II (Miltenyi Biotech) in 1,000 μl of MACS Buffer (0.5% BSA, 2 mM EDTA in PBS) using LS columns (modified from PMID: 26919701). The myelin-depleted sample was then treated with Debris Removal Solution (Miltenyi Biotech) per the manufacturer’s instructions to remove any further cellular debris. Finally, astrocytes were isolated using ACSA-2 beads with LS columns per the manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotech). Astrocytes were resuspended in AstroMACS media (Miltenyi Biotech) and plated at 100,000 cells per well on laminin and poly-&lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-lysine coated coverslips and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. A half media change was performed every two days per the manufacturer instructions. On day 8 astrocyte conditioned media was collected, centrifuged (300&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;, 10 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant concentrated using 10 kDa Amcon Ultra Spin Columns (4,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;, 30 min, 4 °C). Concentrated astrocyte conditioned media samples were stored at −80 °C until analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec50"&gt;Western blot&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spinal cords were isolated from healthy and 3 dpi adult mice (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 4, male and female) to evaluate CCN1 protein levels. Lesion-remote spinal cord tissue rostral and caudal to the SCI lesion and equivalent regions from the healthy core were homogenized by Dounce homogenizer using ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific 89900) with cOmplete, Mini, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, 04693159001). Homogenates were centrifuged at 17,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was estimated by Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kits and Reagents, (Thermo Scientific 23225). Total protein from astrocyte conditioned media was precipitated with acetone (−20 °C for 2 h) and centrifuged. The precipitated proteins were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and subsequently dissolved in RIPA buffer. Finally, samples were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer, heated, and resolved via SDS–PAGE for subsequent western blotting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each case, equal amounts of protein were resolved by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Tgx FastCast Acrylamide Kit, 10%, 1610173, Bio-Rad laboratories) with Precision Plus Protein Blue-Stained Protein Standards, 10–250 kDa (Bio-Rad, 1610373) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane Trans-Blot Transfer Kit, (Bio-Rad, 1704272). To block non-specific binding, membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST, pH 7.4), supplemented with 5% dried skimmed milk. Following blocking, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C under gentle shaking with CYR61 (E5W3H) Rabbit monoclonal primary antibodies (1:1,000; Cell Signaling, 39382S). After 24 h of incubation, membranes were washed with TBST and subsequently incubated with peroxidase (HRP) Anti-rabbit IgG goat secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling, 7074P) for 1 h at room temperature. Specific protein bands were visualized using Clarity Max Western ECL Substrate, (1705062, Bio-Rad laboratories). Membranes were stripped with Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer, (Thermo Scientific, 21059), and reprobed for β-actin (13E5) rabbit monoclonal antibody (1:1,000; Cell Signaling, 4970S0). For quantitative analysis, protein band density was measured using ImageJ, with target signal normalization performed using the corresponding β-actin loading control. In the case of astrocyte conditioned media blots, protein loading was determined by Ponceau &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt; staining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec51"&gt;Human multiple sclerosis and SCI spinal cord tissue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) spinal cord tissues from individuals with multiple sclerosis and neurologically healthy controls were prepared from autopsy-derived tissues collected by the rapid autopsy protocol approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board. Transverse spinal cord sections (7 μm) were prepared and the demyelinated lesions were identified by loss of proteolipid protein immunoreactivity. FFPE spinal cord tissues from individuals with SCI and associated clinical and neuropathological information were obtained from the International Spinal Cord Injury Biobank. The Clinical Research Ethics Board of the University of Columbia (Vancouver, Canada) granted permission for post-mortem spinal cord acquisition and for sharing biospecimens. Spinal cord biospecimens were collected from consented participants or their next of kin and provided as FFPE tissue sections at a thickness of 5 μm. SCI tissue sections evaluated herein derive from lesion-remote regions of the injured cord that exhibit white matter damage and/or Wallerian degeneration as determined by an experienced International Spinal Cord Injury Biobank neuropathologist on the basis of combined LFB with H&amp;amp;E staining, and results from 7 T magnetic resonance imaging of these spinal cord tissue blocks prior to sectioning.

Use of the human samples for this study was approved by the corresponding institutional review boards of either the University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus Dresden (ethical vote BO-EK-57022020, ratified on 10 March 2020) or the Leipzig University Hospital (ethical vote: registration number 322/17-ek, date 10 June 2020 ratified 30 November 2021 and registration number 450/21-ek, date 21 November 2021 ratified on 4 October 2024). Five samples (F-PHH1–F-PHH5) were obtained from cryopreserved hepatocytes from Lonza Pharma&amp;amp;Biotech-Bioscience Solutions. Resected liver specimens were obtained from patients undergoing partial hepatectomy for benign or malignant conditions (for example, colorectal liver metastases, hepatocellular carcinoma or benign focal lesions).

Subsequently, the perfusion solution was switched to solution B (containing 100 mM HEPES, 4.8 mM CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 1 g l&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; collagenase P, in HBSS) and perfused at 37 °C for 5–15 min, also at a rate of 15 ml per 20 s. The digestion process was halted by adding cold William’s E medium supplemented with 1% HEPES, 1% GlutaMAX and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. PHHs were detached from the tissue by shaking using forceps and combing the cells out of the tissue. Afterwards, they were filtered through a 100-µm nylon cell strainer.

Incubation was carried out for 30–60 min at 37 °C on a shaker set at 120 rpm. The digestion was halted by adding cold DMEM supplemented with 1% HEPES, 1% GlutaMAX, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% FBS.

Matrigel was removed and organoids were dissociated to single cells using prewarmed 1× TrypLE (Gibco) for 7–12 min at 37 °C. nRFP-labelled portal fibroblast cultures (passage 5–12) grown in DMEM&lt;sup&gt;+++&lt;/sup&gt; with 20% FBS (Merck/Sigma, F7524) were washed with PBS and dissociated to single cells by incubation with 1× TrypLE for 6 min at 37 °C. Both single-cell suspensions were spun at 200&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min, resuspended in DM medium as described above but without A8301, and then manually counted with a haemocytometer to determine cell concentration. Cultured h-HepOrgs from EM2 medium were split and transferred to EM1 medium for 2 days and then to DM medium for 3 days. Hepatocyte organoids were then collected and washed using cold AdDMEM/F12 supplemented with 1% HEPES, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% GlutaMAX and incubated for 10 min on ice using cold cell recovery solution (Corning, 354253) to remove the ECM. h-HepOrgs were then resuspended using DM without A8301 and placed into a low-attachment six-well plate; differentiated organoids (with bubbly morphology) were selected and hand-picked under a stereomicroscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To define an approach for human periportal liver assembloid formation, several iterations were performed. First, we sought to identify a medium that would support assembloid formation, that is, the culture of all three cell types: hepatocytes, cholangiocytes/ductal cells and portal mesenchyme without overgrowth of any of them, we tested several media and found that a minor adaptation of the DM medium used for h-HepOrgs differentiation without A8301 (assembloid medium) supported culture of the three cell types while preventing their overgrowth. To determine the optimal quantities of the three cell types required for periportal assembloid formation, we first investigated the proportions of portal fibroblasts and ductal cells in healthy human periportal liver tissue. We observed that the ratio varies from donor to donor from 1:1 to 4:1 ductal cells per fibroblast. Therefore, we tested this range of ratios in vitro by varying the proportions of mesenchyme and ductal cells that were mixed with a single h-HepOrg (~200-µm diameter). In short, in 96-well low-attachment U-bottom plates (Corning), we assembled (as described below) 1 h-HepOrg with 25 portal fibroblasts and 25, 50, 100 or 200 cholangiocytes, or with 100 cholangiocytes and 50 or 100 portal fibroblasts. We selected the proportion of 25 portal fibroblasts per 100 cholangiocytes/ductal cells. In AggreWell plates (AggreWell 800, Stem Cell Technologies), we scaled up proportionally, taking into account that the AggreWell 800 plate has 300 microwells in each well and used 7,500 portal fibroblasts, 30,000 cholangiocytes and 100 h-HepOrgs (proportion of 1 h-HepOrg to 75 portal fibroblasts and 300 cholangiocytes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For non-healthy/non-physiological ratios, we used 500 portal fibroblasts, 100 cholangiocytes and 1 h-HepOrg for 96-well low-attachment U-bottom plates, and 15,0000 portal fibroblasts, 30,000 cholangiocytes and 50 h-HepOrgs for AggreWell plates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For assembly in MW96, we mixed fibroblasts and cholangiocytes in 96-well low-adhesion U-bottom plates using 150 μl DM (without A8301) with 2.4 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; methylcellulose (MeC; Sigma, M6385) and spun at 50&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min. Individual h-HepOrgs were then added to the well and the mixture was incubated for 18–24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. For assembly in AggreWell plates, plates were first pretreated as recommended by the manufacturer. Then, ductal and mesenchymal cells together with h-HepOrgs were mixed in 1.5 ml DM (without A8301) with 2.4 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; methylcellulose, spun down for 5 min at 50&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; and incubated for 18–24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. After 18–24 h in suspension in the 96-well/AggreWell plate, the cell suspension was collected with a 1-ml pipette and transferred to a low-attachment 6-well plate. The structures were manually picked under a stereomicroscope and seeded in 25 μl Matrigel dome in prewarmed 48-well plates. The Matrigel was allowed to solidify for 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the wells were overlayed with an additional 300 μl of DM (without A8301). The medium was changed every 3–4 days. Under these conditions, 70% of the initial cholangiocytes formed a lumen. Raw data were incorporated into the quantification of periportal-like spatial organization in assembloids (source data for Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09884-1#Fig12"&gt;7e&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Immunostaining of organoids and assembloids&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For immunofluorescence staining, organoids and assembloids were first extracted from Matrigel with ice-cold Cell Recovery solution and then fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 4 °C.

For storage, liver pieces were kept in PBS at 4 °C. For sectioning, livers were embedded in moulds with 4% low-melting agarose (Bio-Rad, 1613111) in PBS and cut into 50- or 100-μm-thick sections on a vibratome (Leica, VT1200S). For deep tissue imaging, if antigen retrieval was required, tissue sections were placed in Eppendorf tubes with prewarmed 1× citrate buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, C9999), pH 6, at 80 °C for 30 min in a shaking heating block and then washed three times with PBS.

Laser lines 405, 488, 561 and 640 were used for excitation of fluorophores, and GaAsP-PMT detectors were used for detection. High-resolution Airyscan images were acquired using this system for imaging polarity in detail for the tissue sections with a voxel size of 0.0823 × 0.0823 × 0.3 μm.

To improve the resolution, image denoising was performed with deconvolution using HuygensPro. Raw image stacks were imported into the software, and a point spread function (PSF) was either estimated based on the imaging conditions (numerical aperture, wavelength and refractive index) or obtained from PSF calibration images. The HuygensPro classic maximum likelihood estimation (CMLE) algorithm was applied for deconvolution, with an iteration stop criterion based on optimal signal-to-noise ratio and minimal change in successive iterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Image analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantification of the percentage of YAP-positive and YAP-negative nuclei was performed using Arivis 4D Pro software (version 4.2.0).

The total number of nuclei and the number of YAP-positive nuclei were quantified, and, subsequently, the number of YAP-negative nuclei was calculated by subtracting the number of YAP-positive nuclei from the total number of nuclei.

We refer to individual bile canaliculus networks as ‘network’. We determined the connectivity of the network by analysing the total number of branching points (number of triple junctions) per structure. We determined the length of the network per structure by analysing the total length of all branches in the structure. To compare structures in different conditions, we plotted these values as dot plots in which each dot was one structure. In the case of tissue, each dot was one field of view. The features extracted from Fiji were exported as .csv files and plotted using Prism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For assembloids, to visualize the structure from different angles, immunofluorescence images were visualized in 3D using MotionTracking (&lt;a href="http://motiontracking.mpi-cbg.de"&gt;http://motiontracking.mpi-cbg.de&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 43" title="Morales-Navarrete, H. et al.

For this, Gaussian blurring was applied to the channels of interest and then visualized in 3D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For quantification of cholangiocytes and portal fibroblasts in assembloids, Arivis 4D software (Zeiss) was used. For the analysis, nuclei were segmented based on diameter, probability threshold and split sensitivity to align with the expected morphology in the fluorescence images. When segmentation was incomplete due to weak fluorescence signals, missing nuclei were manually added. This approach was used to determine the number of nuclei per cell and the number of cells per organoid. All segmentation results were manually reviewed and corrected as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;Isolation of mRNA and RT–qPCR analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA was extracted from organoid cultures or freshly isolated tissue using the RNeasy Mini RNA Extraction Kit (Qiagen) with DNase treatment and reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). All targets were amplified (40 cycles) using gene-specific primers (Key Resource Table) and PowerUp SYBR Green master mix (ThermoFisher) or iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and run on a qPCR instrument (Thermo Fisher QuantStudio 7 Pro or GeneAmp PCR System 9700; Applied Biosystems respectively).

The following day, cells were exposed to 0.2 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; colcemid (Gibco) for 60 min at 37 °C to arrest them in metaphase. Organoids were dissociated into single cells using TrypLE Express (Gibco). After centrifugation and removal of the supernatant, cells were subjected to hypotonic treatment with a solution of 0.075 M KCl for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by fixation in a 3:1 methanol to acetic acid solution. The preparation was washed three times with the fixative before slide preparation. Chromosomes were stained with Giemsa (Merck) diluted in Gurr buffer (pH 6.8; Gibco).

In brief, for the positive control of 2D hepatocytes, fresh isolated PHHs were plated onto collagen (1.8 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;; RatCol collagen, Advanced Biomatrix)-coated 24-well plates at 500,000 or 250,000 cells per well in William’s E medium (PAN Biotech) supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin and 100 nM dexamethasone for 3 h for attachment. For the monolayer culture (1d-PHH monolayer control), the cells were cultured on William’s E medium supplemented with 1% HEPES + 1% GlutaMAX + 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 100 nM dexamethasone for 18 h (or 24 h, for albumin assays) and then processed for the functional assays. For sandwich cultures, fresh isolated PHHs were plated onto collagen as above and overlayed with a second collagen layer (1.2 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;; RatCol collagen, Advanced Biomatrix) and cultured for 7 days in William’s E medium supplemented with CM4000 cell maintenance supplement (ThermoFisher Scientific).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine albumin secretion, supernatant from 24 h was collected and the amount of albumin was determined using a human-specific albumin ELISA kit (Assay Pro) following the manufacturer’s instructions on an ELISA plate reader (Tecan Spark 20M). To measure cytochrome P450 activity, on the day of the experiment cholangiocyte and hepatocyte organoids in EM2 or DM were removed from Matrigel using Cell Recovery solution (Corning). Organoids, 2D hepatocyte monolayers or 2D sandwich cultures were then all cultured in William’s E medium supplemented with 1% HEPES + 1% GlutaMAX + 1% penicillin/streptomycin supplemented with luciferin-H substrate (100 µM) or luciferin-IPA (3 µM) for 6 h. Cytochrome activity was measured using the P450-Glo Assay Kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions on a plate reader (PerkinElmer Envision). Results were normalized to total viable cell counts per well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Urea synthesis assay&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine urea secretion, cell culture supernatants were collected from 48-well plate after 12 h of culture. The concentration of secreted urea was measured by Urea Assay Kit (Abnova) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Measurement of gluconeogenesis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gluconeogenesis was assessed using a Glucose-Glo Assay (Promega). Organoids/assembloids were first washed twice with PBS to remove residual glucose and then incubated for 24 h in glucose-free medium (Gibco) to deplete intracellular glucose stores. Subsequently, the organoids were stimulated for 24 h in gluconeogenesis-inducing medium (glucose-free medium supplemented with 10 mM lactate; Sigma-Aldrich, L7022) to promote hepatic glucose production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After incubation, 25 µl of supernatant from each well was transferred to a 96-well assay plate and mixed with an equal volume of glucose detection reagent. Following incubation for 60 min at 37 °C, luminescence was measured using a luminometer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;Cell counting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;h-HepOrgs were dissociated into single cells using 10× TrypLE (Gibco) after 10 and 15 days of culture in specified media. Cell counts were determined using a Countess II FL automated cell counter (ThermoFisher Scientific).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec26"&gt;Quantification of xenobiotic metabolism by mass spectrometry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;h-HepOrgs were cultured in DM as previously described. Assembloids were maintained under the same conditions for 6 days. Freshly isolated PHHs were cultured in a monolayer for 24 h, also as described above. Following culture, all cells were washed twice with PBS. The medium was then replaced with 100 μl of William’s E medium supplemented with 1% HEPES, 1% GlutaMAX, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and verapamil (Merck) at a final concentration of 4 µM. Cells were incubated for 6 h, after which the supernatant was collected and analysed by mass spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organoids and assembloids were dissociated into single cells using 10× TrypLE and manually counted using a haemocytometer. The resulting cells were washed twice with PBS and stored at –20 °C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolites were separately extracted from the supernatant and from the cells by isopropanol:methanol:chloroform mixture (4:2:1, v/v/v) containing 7.5 mM ammonium formate (termed MS mix). A supernatant aliquot of 100 μl was diluted 20-fold (v/v) with MS mix, vortexed, centrifuged for 7 min at 13&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; and the pellet was discarded. Cells suspended in 100 μl PBS were first lysed using ~25 stainless steel beads of 0.5 mm in size (Next Advance, USA, 152034) in the Qiagen Ratsch Tissue Lyser at 30 Hz for 8 min and metabolites were extracted as above. Each sample was prepared in three biological replicates and analysed by mass spectrometry immediately after extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on a Q Exactive hybrid quadrupole Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific) in positive ion mode by direct infusion of total extracts. Prior analyses, the internal standard verapamil-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C3 hydrochloride (Merck) was dissolved in methanol and spiked into samples to a final concentration of 200 nM. Aliquots of 40 μl of each sample were then placed on twin.tech PCR Plate 96 (Eppendorf, 0030128.648) and infused into the mass spectrometer via TriVersa NanoMate robotic ion source (Advion Interchim Scientific) using nanoflow chips with a nozzle diameter of 4.1 μm. The ion source was controlled using Chipsoft 8.1.0 software. Spraying voltage and gas back pressure were set to 1.25 kV and 0.95 psi, respectively. The ion transfer capillary temperature was set to 200 °C and the S-lens RF level was set to 50%. A target mass resolution (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;) of 200 was set to 140,000 (full width at half maximum, FWHM) for both Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FT MS) and FT MS/MS spectra. To acquire FT MS spectra, the automated gain control (AGC) was set to 3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, the maximum injection time was set to 500 ms, the acquired mass range &lt;i&gt;m/z&lt;/i&gt; was 50–700, the lock masses &lt;i&gt;m/z&lt;/i&gt; 445.12003 and &lt;i&gt;m/z&lt;/i&gt; 338.34174. The acquisition cycle consisted of recording FT MS&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; spectra for 1.2 min followed by two FT MS/MS&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; spectra for 1.8 min from the precursors with &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; 455.291 (for verapamil [M + H]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; 441.275 (for norverapamil [M + H]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;); precursor &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; isolation width was 3 Th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spectra were averaged in Xcalibur Qual Browser v.3.0 (ThermoFisher Scientific) over a 30-s time range corresponding to stable spray; peaks of metabolites and standard extracted with 5 ppm mass accuracy. The absolute amount of norverapamil was calculated from its molecular ion intensity normalized to the intensity of the standard. For calibration, aliquots of William’s E medium containing verapamil (Merck, V-002-1ML) with the concentration ranging from 2 μM to 8 nM were diluted 20-fold with MS mix, spiked with the internal standard and analysed as described above. The determined abundance of norverapamil in supernatant and in cellular pellets was summed up, normalized to 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; cells and its production rate was expressed in pmol/h.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec27"&gt;Xenotransplantation in &lt;i&gt;Fah&lt;/i&gt;

Mice were housed and maintained under specific-pathogen-free conditions in accordance with the principles of laboratory animal care and the guide set by the HYU Industry-University Cooperation Foundation. All animal experiments were conducted under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Hanyang University (2024-0148B). Experimental groups were not predetermined based on the sex of the mice, and all animals were randomly assigned to experimental procedures. Male mice accounted for approximately 25% of the total cohort. FRG mice 8–16 weeks old were used for all experiments. For their maintenance, mice were administered ad libitum NTBC (2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione) in their drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice aged 8–16 weeks of both sexes were kept on NTBC in drinking water until 3 days before the experiment, when NTBC was withdrawn. h-HepOrgs expanded in EM2 and differentiated in DM were dissociated into single cells and prepared for injection. For transplantation experiments, commercially available frozen PHHs were used (F-PHH2; Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09884-1#MOESM3"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;). Organoids cultured under EM2 medium as well as isolated hepatocytes (PHHs) from the same donors were used as controls. Following dissociation, 500,000 dissociated organoid cells or 800,000 PHHs were resuspended in 100 μl AdDMEM/F-12 medium and injected into the spleen. The non-injected negative-control group received 100 μl PBS instead of cells. Mice were cycled in and out of NTBC treatment for 3 days every time their body weight dropped below 80% of the initial weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec28"&gt;IPA&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We performed IPA (Qiagen) to identify potential candidate signalling pathways. For this, we first generated three DEG lists as DEGs between liver cancer organoids and liver healthy (list 1) or cancer (list 2) tissue (Supplementary Data &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09884-1#MOESM7"&gt;1_S1&lt;/a&gt;) and DEG list between partial hepatectomy and healthy tissue (list 3). Gene lists were generated as follows: lists 1 and 2: gene expression matrices from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-derived organoids, HCC liver tissue and liver tissue from healthy donors were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE84073 (ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 35" title="Broutier, L. et al.

In brief, the significance of the association between the dataset and canonical pathways was determined using a right-tailed Fisher’s exact test, followed by Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple testing. For analyses in which log fold changes were available, an activity &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; score was computed to predict the activation or inhibition likelihood of specific pathways base. Upstream regulator analysis used a computational algorithm to identify upstream regulators potentially responsible for the observed gene expression changes. From the IPA canonical pathway analysis, pathways were filtered based on an adjusted &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value of &amp;lt;0.05 and the presence of the keyword ‘signalling’ in the pathway name (Supplementary Data &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09884-1#MOESM7"&gt;1_S2&lt;/a&gt;).

Samples were then directly subjected to the workflow for strand-specific RNA-seq library preparation (Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep, NEB). For ligation, NEB Next Adapter for Illumina of the NEB Next Multiplex Oligos for Illumina Kit was used. After ligation, adapters were depleted by XP bead purification (BeckmanCoulter) adding the bead solution in a ratio of 0.9:1 to the samples. Unique dual indexing was done during the following PCR enrichment (12 cycles) using amplification primers carrying the same sequence for i7 and i5 index (i5: AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACNNNNNNNNACATCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT; i7: CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATNNNNNNNNGTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT). After two more XP bead purification steps (0.9:1), libraries were quantified using the Fragment Analyzer (Agilent).

Subsequently, the combined dataset underwent normalization, followed by log transformation and detection of the top 4,000 most highly variable genes. We performed PCA and integrated the dataset using Harmony, specifying concatenation of the paper and donor as batch variables, with a maximum of 20 iterations and a theta value of 1.5. Selected genes were visualized in a dot plot (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09884-1#Fig4"&gt;4h&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pseudobulk analyses were then conducted using the decoupleR package to summarize gene expression by cell type. This involved generating a pseudobulk dataset in which raw counts were summed by sample and cell type, ensuring a minimum of 30 cells per group. Following pseudobulk aggregation, the data were normalized and log transformed, with the top most highly variable genes identified on the basis of mean expression and dispersion. Additionally, the ‘paper’ variable was regressed out to mitigate batch effects. Next, PCA was performed on the pseudobulk data, using 50 principal components for subsequent analyses. Hierarchical clustering was executed using the Pearson correlation metric, and Pearson correlation matrices were plotted, as shown in Figs. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09884-1#Fig4"&gt;4g&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09884-1#Fig5"&gt;5f&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marker genes for the three major cell types were computed separately for our organoid data and the merged public data using scanpy’s rank_genes_groups function. For each dataset, the top 300 marker genes for each cell type were selected.

All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Broad Institute (protocol ID 0017-09-14-2). Animal maintenance complied with all relevant ethical regulations and were consistent with local, state and federal regulations as applicable, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec11"&gt;Plasmid construction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;G-blocks encoding the human α-globin 5′ untranslated region (UTR) and 3′ FI element were synthesized de novo by IDT. In vitro transcription vectors were cloned by inserting UTRs into a pET45 vector via Gibson assembly using Gibson Assembly Master Mix (E2611L, NEB) and transformation into chemically competent Stbl3 cells. A hard-coded A30LA70 polyA tail was added by PCR and ligation using the KLD enzyme mix (New England Biolabs). Subsequent coding sequences were inserted by digestion with NcoI and XhoI and Gibson assembly. Plasmid sequences were verified via next-generation sequencing, long-read sequencing (Primordium Labs) and PCR to verify the length of polyA tails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec12"&gt;In vitro transcription and LiCl purification of mRNA&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plasmids were linearized, and a T7-driven in vitro transcription reaction (Life Technologies) was performed to generate mRNA with 101 nucleotide long polyA tails. The 5′ UTR and the 3′ FI elements contained sequences from the human α-globin gene. Capping of mRNA was performed in concert with transcription through addition of a trinucleotide cap1 analogue CleanCap, and m1Ψ-5′-triphosphate (TriLink) was incorporated into the reaction instead of uridine-5′-triphosphate (UTP; Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09873-4#MOESM1"&gt;1a&lt;/a&gt;). LiCl-based purification of mRNA was performed, mRNAs were then checked on an agarose gel and by a TapeStation RNA ScreenTape Analysis (Agilent; Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09873-4#MOESM1"&gt;1b,c&lt;/a&gt;) before aliquoting at 1 µg µl&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and storing at −80 °C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec13"&gt;DFI LNP production&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We engineered a formulation of mRNA-encoded DFI within biodegradable lipopolyplexes, along with control formulations (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09873-4#Fig1"&gt;1e&lt;/a&gt;). To do this, we formulated LNPs by combining SM-102 as ionizable lipid, 1,2-distearoyl-&lt;i&gt;sn&lt;/i&gt;-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), cholesterol and 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 (DMG-PEG-2000) in a molar ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5. These were formulated into LNPs along with mRNA using microfluidic mixing using a NanoAssemblr Ignite nanoparticle formulation system (Cytiva). In brief, an ethanol phase containing the above formulated lipidoid, phospholipid, cholesterol and DMG-PEG master mix was mixed with an aqueous phase (10 mM citrate buffer, pH 3) containing mRNA at a flow rate ratio of 1:3 and at a lipidoid:RNA weight ratio of 10:1. Upon formulation, mRNA–LNPs were diluted in sterile NaCl and the buffer was exchanged by concentrating with a 30-kDa spin filter (UFC9030, MilliporeSigma) to replace residual ethanol. NaCl-diluted mRNA–LNPs were stored at 4 °C until use. For all subsequent experiments, we utilized these SM-102 mRNA–LNPs encapsulating m1Ψ-5′-triphosphate-modified and m7GpppNm-capped DFI, Luc or &lt;i&gt;GFP&lt;/i&gt; mRNA, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec14"&gt;LNP characterization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hydrodynamic size, polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential (ZP) of LNPs were measured using a DynaPro NanoStar II (Wyatt). The mRNA encapsulation efficiency of LNPs were determined using a modified Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA assay (Invitrogen) and found to be more than 85% on average (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09873-4#MOESM1"&gt;1d&lt;/a&gt;). LNP endotoxin levels were consistently found to be less than 1 endotoxin unit per ml. The average hydrodynamic diameter was approximately 75 nm with a polydispersity index of 0.02–0.03 (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09873-4#MOESM1"&gt;1e&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec15"&gt;Cell culture and transfection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless otherwise stated, mammalian cells were maintained in T75 flasks (156499, Thermo Fisher) at 37 °C with 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in either DMEM-GlutaMAX (10569044, Thermo Fisher) or RPMI-GlutaMAX (61870127, Thermo Fisher). All media were supplemented with 10% FBS (97068-085, VWR) and 1× penicillin–streptomycin (15140122, Thermo Fisher). For growth of primary T cells, media were also supplemented with 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (21985023, Thermo Fisher). Images of transfected cells were acquired on a Leica DMI8 Confocal Microscope running Leica Application Suite X (1.4.3), equipped with a Lecia Stellaris 5 camera using an HC PL APO CS2 ×20/0.75 DRY objective and a pinhole setting of 1 Airy Unit. Images were processed using Fiji (&lt;a href="https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads"&gt;https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Flow cytometry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells were prepared and stained according to the staining protocol of each experiment outlined below, pelleted at 500&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 5 min and resuspended in 200 µl of flow cytometry buffer (PBS supplemented with 2% EDTA (15575020, Life Technologies) and 5% FBS (97068-085, VWR)). Samples were run on Beckman Coulter Cytoflex LX flow cytometers and analysis was performed using the FlowJo v10 software.

Before viability dye and surface antibody staining, cells were incubated with appropriately titrated tetramer combinations. Unless stated otherwise, tetramer staining was performed in PBS for 20 min on ice, followed by washing and addition of antibody cocktails and/or fixation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For OVA vaccination experiments, SIINFEKL–H-2K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;–PE and SIINFEKL–H-2K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;–APC tetramers were used at 1:100 dilution and AAHAEINEA–I-A&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;–PE and AAHAEINEA–I-A&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;–APC tetramers were used at 1:20 dilution. For central tolerance experiments in Act-mOVA mice, the same SIINFEKL–H-2K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; tetramers (1:100 dilution) were used in combination with AAHAEINEA–I-A&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;–PE and AAHAEINEA–I-A&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;–APC tetramers (1:20 dilution). Non-vaccinated wild-type T cells (negative) and OT-I and OT-II T cells (positive) were included as staining controls for MHC class I and class II tetramers, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For autoimmunity experiments in NOD mice, KYNKANAFL–H-2K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;–PE and KYNKANAFL–H-2K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;–APC tetramers were used at 1:50 dilution, with NY8.3 T cells serving as positive controls for staining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) experiments in C57BL/6J mice, GWYRSPFSRVVH–I-A&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;–PE and GWYRSPFSRVVH–I-A&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;–APC tetramers were used at 1:25 dilution.

For all other exploratory experiments, no sample size calculations were performed. For all experiments, allocation of mice into experimental groups was randomized after stratifying for age and sex. Separate investigators performed treatment and data collection. Data-collecting investigators, for example, for tumour size measurements, were blinded to the treatment groups. Data-analysing investigators were not blinded to the treatment groups, as they involved internal controls, with the exception of pathologists for toxicity studies, who were blinded for the analyses.

Mice were injected through retro-orbital injection with Luc mRNA–LNPs at a dose of 5 μg mRNA per mouse, and bioluminescence imaging was performed on an IVIS imaging system (PerkinElmer). At 6 h post-injection, mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and intraperitoneally injected with &lt;span class="u-small-caps"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;-luciferin potassium salt (150 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (body weight)). Mice or dissected organs were imaged 10 min post-injection using auto-exposure settings. The luminescent activity was quantified using Aura 4.0 imaging software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec21"&gt;Quantification of in vivo DLL1 levels in the liver&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess DLL1 protein induction following DFI, mice were intravenously injected with either 5 µg DFI mRNA–LNPs in 100 µl NaCl. The mice were then anaesthetized with isoflurane and rapidly decapitated. Liver tissue samples were harvested from the mediolateral lobe and placed in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound. Then, the liver tissue in O.C.T. was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Liver DLL1 levels were measured using immunofluorescence. In brief, liver tissue was cryo-sectioned at 15 µm thickness, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 100 mmol l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; glycine diluted in PBS for 10 min. Samples were blocked with blocking buffer (10% normal donkey serum (017-000-121, Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBS–0.1% Tween-20) and stained with anti-DLL1 antibody (ab10554, Abcam; 1:800 dilution in blocking buffer) at 4 °C overnight. Samples were then washed with PBS–0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 × 10 min, stained with AF546-labelled secondary antibody (A10040, Invitrogen; 1:500 dilution in blocking buffer) at room temperature for 1 h and washed with PBS–0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 × 10 min. Samples were then stained with DAPI and AF488-phalloidin (A12379, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol to visualize the plasma membrane of hepatocytes. Liver DLL1 levels were quantified by taking the immunofluorescence signal intensity normalized to DAPI intensity at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after injection (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3 mice per condition and time point). Uninjected littermates served as baseline controls (0 h). Tissue concentrations were expressed as fold change relative to baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec22"&gt;Quantification of in vivo IL-7 and FLT3-L levels&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess cytokine induction following DFI or recombinant protein administration, mice were intravenously injected with either 5 µg DFI mRNA–LNPs in 100 µl NaCl or 10 µg recombinant mouse IL-7 (217-17, PeproTech) or 10 µg recombinant mouse FLT3-L (250-31L, PeproTech) in NaCl containing 0.1% BSA. Blood samples were collected by terminal cardiac puncture using EDTA-coated syringes and transferred to BD Microtainer tubes (365974, BD). Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 2,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min at room temperature and snap frozen for later analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liver tissue samples were harvested from the mediolateral lobe, weighed for normalization and snap frozen. Frozen tissue fragments were homogenized on ice in 200 µl PBS containing protease inhibitor cocktail (P8340-1ML, Sigma) using a pre-chilled glass douncer with 15 strokes. Homogenates were clarified by centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C), and supernatants were stored at −80 °C. IL-7 and FLT3-L levels in both the serum and liver were quantified using ELISA kits (mouse IL-7, EMIL7, Invitrogen; mouse FLT3-L, EMFLT3L, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm with 570-nm background subtraction, and cytokine concentrations were calculated using logistic regression fitted to the standard curve. Samples were processed in technical triplicates, and the mean value was used for biological replicates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serum and liver cytokine levels were measured at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after injection (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3 mice per condition and time point). Uninjected littermates served as baseline controls (0 h). Tissue concentrations were normalized to organ weight and expressed as fold change relative to baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess age-dependent changes in thymic cytokine levels, thymus lobes were isolated from untreated C57BL/6J mice across a range of ages, including 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3 per age group). Thymic tissue was weighed, snap frozen and processed identically to liver samples. FLT3-L concentrations were determined by ELISA, normalized to thymus weight and used to calculate total cytokine abundance across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Subcutaneous immunization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adult (6 weeks) and aged (72 weeks) mice were immunized with 1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; full-length OVA protein emulsified in complete Freund’s adjuvant (EK-0301, Hooke Laboratories), followed by one booster dose of 1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; protein emulsified in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA; EK-0311, Hooke Laboratories). Mice were injected with antigen emulsified in complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) subcutaneously at two sites on the chest, injecting 0.1 ml at each site (total of 0.2 per mouse). The needle was kept inserted in the subcutaneous space for 10–15 s after each injection to avoid leakage of the emulsion. A booster injection of antigen emulsified in IFA was administered 14 days after immunization with antigen–CFA emulsion.

Samples were tested on the Milliplex MAP mouse cytokine/chemokine magnetic bead panel (MCYTOMAG-70K-PMX, Millipore) according to the kit protocol as qualified. Data were collected by xPONENT 4.3 (Luminex) and data analysis was completed using BELYSA 1.1.0 software. The data collected by the instrument software are expressed as median fluorescence intensity (MFI). MFI values for each analyte were collected per each individual sample well. Analyte standards, quality controls and sample MFI values were adjusted for background. Calibrator data were fit to either a five-parameter logistic or four parameter logistic model depending on best fit to produce accurate standard curves for each analyte. Quality control and sample data were interpolated from the standard curves and then adjusted according to the dilution factor to provide calculated final concentrations of each analyte present in the sample. Samples demonstrating haemolysis were excluded from the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec38"&gt;Histopathological assessment of liver tissue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the hepatic safety of LNP administration, liver tissue was harvested from female C57BL/6J mice. Twelve mice (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 4 per group) comprising adult untreated controls, aged mice treated for 28 days with Luc–LNPs and aged mice treated for 28 days with DFI–LNPs were intracardially perfused under terminal anaesthesia with ice-cold 1× PBS, followed by 4% PFA. Livers were dissected, post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C and submitted to IDEXX BioAnalytics for blinded histopathological assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon receipt, liver tissues were trimmed, paraffin embedded, sectioned and mounted onto glass slides. Sections were routinely stained with haematoxylin and eosin to assess general histology and hepatocellular integrity. Serial sections were stained with Masson’s Trichrome to visualize connective tissue and assess the presence of fibrosis. Microscopic evaluation was performed by board-certified veterinary pathologists blinded to treatment groups. Histopathological changes were graded for severity using a standardized semi-quantitative scale: 0 for no significant findings, 1 for minimal, 2 for mild, 3 for moderate, and 4 for severe. Evaluation criteria adhered to the International Harmonization of Nomenclature and Diagnostic Criteria standards (&lt;a href="https://www.toxpath.org/inhand.asp"&gt;https://www.toxpath.org/inhand.asp&lt;/a&gt;). Numerical lesion scores were used to quantify both prevalence and severity of histological changes within and across experimental groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec39"&gt;Dissociated scRNA-seq and data preprocessing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart blood was obtained through cardiac puncture in mice following cervical dislocation and stored in 0.5% EDTA for subsequent processing. Red blood cells were lysed using 1 ml ACK lysis buffer (Thermo). Freshly isolated immune cells post-lysis of red blood cells were blocked with rat anti-mouse CD16/32 (0.5 μg per well, eBioscience). Subsequently, respective antibodies in PBS were added in a total volume of 50 μl and stained for 30 min. eFluor 780 fixable viability dye (eBioscience) was used per the manufacturer’s protocol to exclude dead cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For scRNA-seq, cells were divided into eight aliquots per animal sample and pre-incubated for 10 min with titrated amounts of TotalSeq hashtag antibodies (C0301-C0308, BioLegend). Cells were sorted on a BD Aria Fusion cell sorter using a 100-μM nozzle and four-way purity mode. From peripheral blood, viable T cells (live, CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) were sorted in 20 μl 0.04% BSA in PBS and kept on ice until processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single-cell capture, reverse transcription and library preparation were conducted on the Chromium platform (10X Genomics) with the single-cell 5′ reagent v2 kit (10X Genomics) following the manufacturer’s protocol, using 40,000 cells as input per channel. Each pool of cells underwent library quality testing, and library concentration was assessed. The final library for each pool was subjected to paired-end sequencing (26 bp and 92 bp) on one Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S2 lane. Raw sequencing data were processed and aligned to the mouse genome (GRCm39 — mm39) using the CellRanger pipeline (10X Genomics, v7.1.0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec40"&gt;scRNA-seq analysis of circulating T cells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seurat datasets were generated for blood T cells at each time point. Singlets were identified per the published Seurat vignette (&lt;a href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/hashing_vignette.html"&gt;https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/hashing_vignette.html&lt;/a&gt;) and used for downstream analyses. In addition, only cells with more than 500 and less than 4,000 unique features were detected, and less than 5% of mitochondrial counts were considered for further analysis. Blood datasets for each age group underwent merging and integration using the harmony package, following the guidelines in the published vignette (&lt;a href="https://portals.broadinstitute.org/harmony/SeuratV3.html"&gt;https://portals.broadinstitute.org/harmony/SeuratV3.html&lt;/a&gt;). The integration process involved the application of the following arguments: NormalizeData(), FindVariableFeatures(selection.method = “vst”, nfeatures = 2000),ScaleData(), RunPCA(), RunHarmony(“orig.ident”, plot_convergence = TRUE, dims.use = 1:20), RunUMAP(reduction = “harmony”, dims = 1:20), FindNeighbors(reduction = “harmony”, dims = 1:20), FindClusters(resolution = 0.5). After removing cells failing quality control, integration was reiterated with the same settings, and final transcriptional clusters for downstream analyses were identified using the FindClusters function (resolution = 0.7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annotation of mouse peripheral blood datasets was carried out manually, based on the final transcriptional clustering post-quality control and integration, using canonical marker genes and differential gene expression analyses through the FindAllMarkers function in Seurat. For subsequent visualization subsets for CD8 T cells (clusters: CD8_T activated, CD8_T cytotox, CD8_T effector-like, CD8_T exhausted, CD8_T IFN-responsive, CD8_T memory-like and CD8_T naive-like; 56,967 cells) and CD4 T cells (clusters: CD4_T activated, CD4_T IFN-responsive, CD4_T memory-like/naive, CD4_T naive and Treg; 39,716 cells) were built and a new UMAP embedding based on the harmony components was calculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statistical significance of changes in cell-type abundance over time in the single-cell data was assessed using Pearson correlation through the cor.test(…, method= “pearson”) function. For visualization, log&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fold changes of cell-type proportions at each time point relative to the 4-week time point were computed and graphically represented. Cell types exhibiting a significant correlation with increasing age (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) were colour annotated. Density UMAP visualization was performed using the ggplot2 stat_density_2d() function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec41"&gt;scRNA-seq and V(D)J-seq analyses of B16-OVA TILs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;B16-OVA were explanted at day +12 post-injection so that tumour sizes remained comparable between treatment groups. Tumour tissues were minced and enzymatically digested in RPMI supplemented with Liberase (5401119001, Roche) for 30 min at 37 °C with gentle agitation. Following digestion, tissues were filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer and centrifuged. The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in a 40% Percoll–PBS solution and layered on top of a 80% Percoll–PBS solution in 50 ml followed by centrifugation at 1,260&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 20 min at room temperature with the acceleration at the lowest setting and no break. The middle interface layer containing TILs was isolated and stained with a fixable viability dye (eFluor780) respective fluorophore-labelled antibodies, as well as an oligo-conjugated and PE-labelled H-2Kb SIINFEKL dextramer (JD02163DXG PE 25, Immudex). Cells were sorted on a Sony MA900 cell sorter using a 100-μM nozzle. Viable T cells (live, CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) were sorted in 20 μl 0.04% BSA in PBS and kept on ice until processing.

                &lt;p&gt;The journey to finding an effective treatment for Alzheimer’s disease seems to have hit another dead end. The latest casualty: medications designed to tackle the viral illness herpes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Columbia University published the disappointing results of their randomized trial this week. Cognition in people with diagnosed herpes and early Alzheimer’s did not improve with antiviral treatment compared to a placebo—in fact, the treatment group actually fared worse. Though the findings don’t necessarily rule out a genuine link between some viral infections and Alzheimer’s, the use of these drugs for treating dementia shouldn’t be encouraged, according to outside experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For persons with symptoms of cognitive impairment, there is no, repeat no, role for antiviral therapy,” David Knopman, a clinical neurologist at the Mayo Clinic not affiliated with the study, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The viral hypothesis&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia, &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/ef8f48f9-ad36-48ea-87f9-b74034635c1e/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf"&gt;affecting&lt;/a&gt; over 7 million Americans today.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The disorder is characterized by having high levels of two misfolded proteins in the brain: amyloid beta and tau. But researchers are still unsure about the exact role these proteins play in driving the disease or what triggers the chain of destruction that eventually consumes the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In recent years, some research has suggested that certain viruses and other germs might be one potential cause of Alzheimer’s, or at least an important contributor to the disease—the so-called viral hypothesis of Alzheimer’s. Some studies have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/yet-more-evidence-that-viruses-may-cause-alzheimers-dis-1827511539"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that herpesvirus infections can trigger the build-up of amyloid beta plaques in mice with human-like brain cells, for instance, or that people who die from Alzheimer’s are &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/herpesviruses-linked-to-alzheimers-disease-in-new-brain-1827020949"&gt;more likely&lt;/a&gt; to have herpesviruses in their brains than people without the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;These studies have only provided indirect evidence of a viral connection so far. But if such viruses can cause Alzheimer’s, then it might be possible to prevent or slow its progression by treating a person’s underlying infection. And that’s what these researchers set out to test.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A study failure&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The randomized, controlled trial involved 120 participants diagnosed with probable Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment likely to develop into Alzheimer’s. They also tested positive for antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 1 or 2. HSV-1 is the primary cause of cold sores, while HSV-2 most often causes genital herpes, but either type can cause the other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For 18 months, the participants were randomized to take a daily placebo or valacyclovir (better known by the brand name Valtrex), a standard treatment used to manage HSV and other kinds of herpesvirus infections.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the study’s end, the treatment group saw a significantly worse progression of cognitive decline compared to the placebo. Based on imaging tests, the treatment also didn’t improve people’s brain markers or their overall neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Valacyclovir was not efficacious with cognitive worsening for the primary outcome,” the researchers wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.21738?guestAccessKey=2b0c16c4-ad92-4700-ad9b-ae3dea904157&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=121725"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in JAMA.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The future of a viral link&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As damning as these results are, they don’t completely sink the idea that viruses can contribute to at least some cases of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It often takes time before the damaging brain changes seen in Alzheimer’s become apparent. And by the time someone is experiencing Alzheimer’s symptoms, it might simply be too late to slow the disease’s progression by treating infections that knocked the first domino down, so to speak, many years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Indeed, this might be true for other drivers of Alzheimer’s. Scientists are now &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/can-a-drug-prevent-alzheimers-disease-decades-before-it-happens-2000559730"&gt;testing&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, whether anti-amyloid drugs can prevent or slow the illness in people genetically destined to have Alzheimer’s decades before they should become sick.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While a similar approach isn’t safe to test out with the viral hypothesis, we already have a reliable method for preventing some viral illnesses: vaccines. And &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/shingles-vaccine-doesnt-just-lower-dementia-risk-it-could-also-help-treat-it-2000695823"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/unique-study-is-latest-to-show-shingles-vaccine-can-prevent-dementia-2000583567"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/shingles-might-be-bad-for-your-brain-2000486473"&gt;lately&lt;/a&gt; have found evidence that vaccinating people against shingles, caused by the reactivation of another herpesvirus (the varicella-zoster virus), can lower their risk of later being diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Might there be a role at the population level for vaccination? Maybe?,” said Knopman, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study in JAMA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be clear, more research is needed to confirm a causative link between shingles and Alzheimer’s, as well as the potential protective role of vaccination. But it might represent the hopeful silver lining to this otherwise glum news.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM (VINnews) An unusual medical emergency occurred in Jerusalem during the Hanukkah holiday, when a young man in his early 20s suffered a life-threatening allergic reaction shortly after eating a doughnut. The young man, who has a severe milk allergy, was unaware that the food he had consumed contained dairy ingredients, and within a short time began developing serious symptoms of an acute allergic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong class="whatsapp-promotion-mobile"&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident took place in the early afternoon. Passersby who noticed the young man’s rapidly worsening condition, realized it was a serious medical emergency and immediately called emergency services. Within minutes, medical teams from United Hatzalah arrived at the scene and quickly identified the condition as anaphylaxis caused by exposure to milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volunteers began life-saving treatment on site, and after clarifying his medical background, decided to administer adrenaline via an EpiPen injector. Dr. Natan Unger, a volunteer physician with United Hatzalah, described the incident:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I injected the young man with adrenaline after it became clear that he is allergic to milk. In addition, he was treated with oxygen and medications until his condition stabilized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the rapid intervention and professional treatment, the young man’s condition improved. He was urgently evacuated to the hospital for further examinations and medical observation, fully conscious and in stable condition.&lt;/p&gt;

Visits for respiratory illnesses increased 24%. And unusual blood test results increased 118%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings were reported in &lt;a class="link" href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.10.079" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a new study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  published Wednesday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The study, part of &lt;a class="link" href="https://lafirehealth.org/data/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a research project &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;documenting the fires’ long-term health effects, joins several recent papers documenting the disasters’ physical toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While other U.S. wildfires have consumed more acres or cost more lives, the Palisades and Eaton fires were uniquely dangerous to human health because they burned an unusual mix of materials: the trees, brush and organic material of a typical wildfire, along with a toxic stew of cars, batteries, plastics, electronics and other man-made materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no precedent for a situation that exposed this many people to this kind of smoke, the paper’s authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Los Angeles has seen wildfires before, it will see wildfires again, but the Eaton fire and the Palisades fire were unique, both in their size, their scale and the sheer volume of material that burned,” said Dr. Joseph Ebinger, a Cedars-Sinai cardiologist and the paper’s first author. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team did not find a significant increase in the overall number of visits to the medical center’s emergency room between Jan. 7, the day the fires began, and April 7. The department recorded fewer in-person visits for mental health emergencies and chronic conditions during that time compared to the same time period in earlier years, said Dr. Susan Cheng, director of public health research at Cedars-Sinai and the study’s senior author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in visits for acute cardiovascular problems and other serious sudden illnesses made up the difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study team also looked at results from blood tests drawn from patients visiting the ER for serious physical symptoms without immediate explanation — dizziness without dehydration, for example, or chest pains not caused by heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their blood tests returned unusual results at a rate more than double that seen in previous years. These atypical numbers cut across the spectrum of the blood panel, Cheng said. “It could be electrolyte disorder, change in protein levels, change in markers of kidney or liver function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of unusual test results held steady through the three-month period, leading the team to conclude that exposure to the fires’ smoke “has led to some kind of biochemical metabolic stress in the body that likely affected not just one but many organ systems,” Cheng said. “That’s what led to a range of different types of symptoms affecting different people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joan Casey, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Washington who was not part of the Cedars-Sinai team, noted that the study found health effects lasting over a longer period than similar studies have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three months “is a substantial length of time to observe elevated visits, as most studies focused on acute care utilization following wildfire smoke exposure find increased visit counts over about a weeklong period,” Casey said. Her &lt;a class="link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2842059" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;own research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found a 27% increase in outpatient respiratory visits among Kaiser Permanente Southern California members living within 12.4 miles of the burn zones in the week following the fires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The L.A. fires were such a severe event, including not only smoke, but also evacuation and substantial stress in the population, that effects may have lingered longer,” Casey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-one people are known to have died as a direct result of injuries sustained in the fires. But researchers believe that when taking into account deaths from health conditions worsened by the smoke, the true toll is significantly higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class="link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2837351#" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;research letter published earlier this year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. calculated that there were &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-06/deaths-from-eaton-and-palisades-fires-could-top-400"&gt;&lt;u&gt;440 excess deaths&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in L.A. County between Jan. 5 and Feb. 1. That paper looked at deaths caused by a variety of factors, from exposure to air pollution to disrupted healthcare as a result of closures and evacuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, a team from Stanford University &lt;a class="link" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.5c01089" target="_blank"&gt;published itsprojection&lt;/a&gt; that exposure to the fires’ smoke, specifically, led to 14 deaths otherwise unaccounted for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wildfire is a major source of fine particulate pollution, bits measuring 2.5 microns or less in diameter that are small enough to cross the barriers that separate blood from the brain and the lungs’ outer branches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with other sources, wildfire smoke contains a higher proportion of ultrafine particles miniscule enough to penetrate the brain after inhalation, Casey told The Times &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2025-08-07/climate-change-physical-costs"&gt;&lt;u&gt;earlier this year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The smoke has been linked to a range of health problems, including dementia, cancer and cardiovascular failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last decade, increasing numbers of wildfires in Western states have released &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06522-6" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;enough fine particulate pollution&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-06-17/2020-california-wildfires-offset-decades-of-air-quality-gains"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reverse years’ worth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of improvements under the Clean Air Act and other antipollution measures. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxORFNkUE5zaE8xa1lwMGl0eV94aElSM1ZTV0dkZUZKc216UEkxRzd1eTZieDJmd0VxdWEtODVYaTJhMVlkRFJOV18xV2JveGF6V3l4QlhLanNaOThuUlZ2X3E5UThPZVd2RVFaTWtyemp5UFpFQmVRV0xjZFFsTFV1bERqczhMaDhlTk9Vbi0wQ3NlNDZ2S2FlUHVSenl3amFGX0ZpTGx5bWJvbkRaakE</guid></item><item><title>在重大政策转变中，美国疾控中心终止了所有新生儿都应接种乙型肝炎疫苗的指导-路透社</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-cdc-accepts-advisers-recommendations-hepatitis-b-vaccine-major-policy-shift-2025-12-16/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 14:55:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi5AFBVV95cUxPZlpkdnJqUmFrUHdseGU3aDR1emVLeU1KdWo1dWJZWVhTOWc2b3g3bXFrSzRKSllOVXp2ZVJPNHIzRjNnSWJ4TkIwalZ4OEdOeUpEc0FFcElYeFFRMkV4ZzZoZE0xeWZJWDVmeVAtZDN1UElyRzkzV1BFYzgwUFJDWW45WC1TeTZsQnlYRlJkcG1mT2hvcktLSWtHYno2VjZHM2dLLVk2N18zR2stbTNXX2RUbjQ3XzhBV3o1U0N5a1hPZDF6Y056WG1pQ0p2OEw4ZlN1T0lkRkxEdEF2c21sc1d6QUo</guid></item><item><title>麻疹的价格：每次有人感染麻疹至少要花$ 16,200。- MarketWatch</title><link>https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-price-of-the-measles-it-costs-at-least-16-200-every-time-someone-gets-them-2666bbd1</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MarketWatch</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 14:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxQSFBwRGdxSWtscDYteUZ5V0FocmxqWnRCM0tPcTg5OWVEZmxzcFZMaGxCVDgwLXhlSTFfbE9FTFRod3otQURPS1JzRVJFQS1aN1VyZ3ltZ2RBZjZIWUNSLXBNMzVTdTlTRUpVRm13enJBVllhc3d6bWVjekpYMV9mbXlwVEtjUFB0bzA3QXp3emhTeUh2NXcyTjgzV3liZGdwczhQSlFwRjBkc2hEMVM5VHp2TjZ3SXI5NzBRY3Vn</guid></item><item><title>他吃了一个汉堡，几小时后就死了。医生发现了一个令人震惊的事业- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251217082457.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Researchers at the University of Virginia School of Medicine have confirmed the first known death caused by the condition commonly referred to as the meat allergy, which is transmitted by ticks.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case involved a 47 year old man from New Jersey who was previously healthy and died suddenly about four hours after eating beef. For months, the cause of his death remained unclear. That changed when Thomas Platts Mills, MD, PhD, a UVA Health physician and internationally recognized allergy specialist, took a closer look. Platts Mills originally identified the condition years ago and continues to lead research into how it affects patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Lone Star Tick Bites Trigger Alpha Gal Allergy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allergy develops after a bite from the Lone Star tick. These bites can cause the immune system to become sensitive to alpha gal, a sugar naturally found in meat from mammals. Once sensitized, people may experience allergic symptoms after eating foods such as beef, pork, or lamb. Common reactions include skin rashes, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long suspected that severe cases could escalate into life threatening anaphylaxis. Until now, however, no fatal cases had been officially confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The important information for the public is: First, that severe abdominal pain occurring 3 to 5 hours after eating beef, pork or lamb should be investigated as a possible episode of anaphylaxis; and, second, that tick bites that itch for more than a week or larvae of ticks often called 'chiggers' can induce or increase sensitization to mammalian-derived meat," said Platts Mills, former chief of UVA Health's Division of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology. "On the other hand, most individuals who have mild to moderate episodes of hives can control symptoms with an appropriate diet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Happened Before the Man's Death&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man, whose name was not made public, had gone camping with his wife and children during the summer of 2024. One evening, the family ate a late steak dinner at 10 p.m. Around 2 a.m., the man woke up with intense stomach pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Although he felt better by morning, he later told his son that the episode had felt life threatening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two weeks later, still unaware that he had developed the meat allergy, he attended a barbeque and ate a hamburger. He began feeling unwell shortly after 7 p.m. At 7:37 p.m., his son found him collapsed in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autopsy Raises More Questions Than Answers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An autopsy did not reveal a clear explanation for his death. The official cause was listed as "sudden unexplained death."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His wife was not satisfied with that conclusion and asked another physician to review the findings. That doctor contacted Platts Mills and his team to explore whether alpha gal sensitivity could be involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood Tests Reveal Severe Allergic Reaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platts Mills obtained blood samples that had been collected after the man's death. Testing showed that he had indeed been sensitized to alpha gal. The results also pointed to an extreme immune response consistent with fatal anaphylaxis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked about recent tick exposure, the man's wife said he had not noticed any tick bites in the past year. However, she recalled that he had suffered 12 or 13 itchy bites around his ankles earlier in the summer, which they believed were caused by chiggers. Platts Mills recognized that many bites thought to be from chiggers in the eastern United States are actually from Lone Star tick larvae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factors That May Have Worsened the Reaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platts Mills and his colleagues believe several conditions may have intensified the man's allergic response. These include drinking a beer with the hamburger, exposure to ragweed pollen, and physical exercise earlier that day. Family members also noted that he rarely ate red meat, which may have influenced how his immune system reacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing Tick Populations Increase Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the case, Platts Mills is urging doctors to stay alert for patients who may have developed this allergy or who face higher exposure risk. He pointed out that deer populations are rapidly increasing in many states, creating ideal conditions for the Lone Star tick to spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is important that both doctors and patients who live in an area of the country where Lone Star ticks are common should be aware of the risk of sensitization," Platts Mills said. "More specifically, if they have unexpected episodes of severe abdominal pain occurring several hours after eating mammalian meat, they should be investigated for possible sensitization to the oligosaccharide alpha-gal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case Findings Published in Medical Journal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the case have been published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice&lt;/em&gt;. The article is open access, meaning it is available to read for free. The authors include Platts Mills, Lisa J. Workman, Nathan E. Richards, Jeffrey M. Wilson, and Erin M. McFeely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team obtained consent from the man's widow before releasing the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;One of the best visualizations ever produced of the spectrum of light from our glorious Sun reveals some mysterious holes in its array of colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the thousands of dark &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_lines"&gt;Fraunhofer lines&lt;/a&gt; in the solar rainbow have been traced to different elements in the Sun's atmosphere absorbing the light at that particular wavelength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even with decades of high-resolution solar &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_spectroscopy"&gt;spectroscopy&lt;/a&gt;, there are some spectral lines whose origins have never been clearly identified. That's not for lack of trying – but our Sun is a wilful and tricksome beast whose &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-finally-solve-70-year-mystery-of-suns-impossible-heat"&gt;secrets are surprisingly difficult to uncover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/something-is-up-with-the-sun-and-it-could-mean-our-models-are-wrong"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Sun Is Being Weird. It Could Be Because We're Looking at It All Wrong&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although our Sun appears to blaze in white light, the particulars of its full spectrum are a lot more complex. The below image shows the full solar spectrum, compiled from &lt;a href="https://noirlab.edu/public/images/noao-sun/"&gt;observations obtained&lt;/a&gt; at the US National Solar Observatory on Kitt Peak in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_184787" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-184787" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/solar-spectrum.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-184787" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/solar-spectrum.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/solar-spectrum-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-184787" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The high-resolution spectrum of the Sun recorded in 1984. (&lt;a href="https://noirlab.edu/public/images/noao-sun/"&gt;N.A. Sharp/KPNO/NOIRLab/NSO/NSF/AURA&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several remarkable things about the spectrum. One you may notice immediately is that the light is brightest at yellow-green wavelengths, even though the Sun's rays appear completely colorless in the sky (please &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/please-don-t-stare-at-the-sun-even-if-pete-evans-says-it-s-good-for-you"&gt;don't go out and look at it without eye protection&lt;/a&gt;, though).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another obvious feature is the presence of dark patches. These are the Fraunhofer lines, named after German physicist &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_von_Fraunhofer"&gt;Josef von Fraunhofer&lt;/a&gt;, who documented them in 1814. We've known about them for over 200 years, and their mechanism is pretty well understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're absorption lines, and similar features can be seen on every star and galaxy for which spectra can be obtained. They are caused by the absorption of photons at that wavelength by atoms and molecules in the solar atmosphere. Different elements &lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/science-overview/science-explainers/spectroscopy-101-types-of-spectra-and-spectroscopy/"&gt;absorb&lt;/a&gt; different wavelengths of light; a specific &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weve-just-found-an-exoplanet-thats-as-stinky-as-uranus"&gt;pattern of absorption lines&lt;/a&gt; can serve as the fingerprint of that element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a very clever way of finding out what elements are present in a star or galaxy or even planetary atmosphere, but it's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hidden-source-of-mysterious-glow-in-the-early-universe-finally-revealed"&gt;rather more difficult&lt;/a&gt; than it sounds, especially if multiple fingerprints are visible and overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, most of the Fraunhofer lines have been identified, and that's how we know the Sun – predominantly hydrogen and helium, like all stars – also has a bunch of stuff like &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202140445"&gt;oxygen, sodium, calcium&lt;/a&gt;, and even trace amounts of &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is no idle curiosity, either. When the Universe was born, it consisted almost entirely of hydrogen and a bit of helium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/half-the-universes-matter-was-missing-astronomers-just-found-it"&gt;actually still the case&lt;/a&gt;, but to a slightly lesser extent, because once the stars were born, they started smashing together atoms in their cores to make heavier elements. Then, when those stars died, they not only scattered those heavier elements out into space, but their violent explosions &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ghost-particles-could-boost-gold-production-in-neutron-star-collisions"&gt;created heavier elements still&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequent generations of stars incorporated those materials into their own formation. The number and array of elements heavier than helium in a star are tools by which scientists can &lt;a href="https://www.eso.org/public/blog/how-old-are-the-stars/"&gt;calculate&lt;/a&gt; that star's age. Nifty stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the Sun is the closest star we have access to, it's the star for which we have the most detailed spectral data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this wealth of data, hundreds of observed absorption features remain unmatched to the chemistry that created them, or inconsistent with synthetic spectra – a set of absorption features generated by modeling a synthetic Sun based on its temperature, gravity, atmospheric structure, and other characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons for this, neatly documented &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201629817"&gt;in a 2017 paper&lt;/a&gt; investigating a specific set of missing lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possibly the biggest contributor to the puzzle is that the &lt;a href="https://vald.astro.uu.se/"&gt;current databases&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/lines_form.html"&gt;atomic and molecular lines&lt;/a&gt;, although large, are far from complete. Determining the spectral fingerprint of a specific atom or molecule often requires testing and verification, and some groups, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1140/epjd/s10053-024-00891-x"&gt;such as the iron group&lt;/a&gt;, are particularly complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Sun itself is also a large part of the problem, with a dynamic and variable atmosphere dominated by &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1004.3438"&gt;convection&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201525874"&gt;wildly changing magnetic fields&lt;/a&gt; that can interfere with the appearance of absorption features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201629817"&gt;set of mystery lines&lt;/a&gt; in the solar spectrum at wavelengths that don't match the synthetic spectra, and can't be attributed to any known atomic or molecular absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, honestly, it is pretty cool that, even after centuries of study, the closest star to Earth has some knotty mysteries we have yet to untangle – mysteries that, on a superficial level at least, look more solvable than they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that we're getting closer to finding answers every day. Better &lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/muse/"&gt;instruments&lt;/a&gt;, growing databases of spectral lines, and improved atmospheric models of the Sun all &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac2905"&gt;contribute to this progress&lt;/a&gt;. And every mismatch between the real and synthetic spectra is a clue that tells us how we might improve our models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we'll probably never finish studying our Sun. That's a marvelous thing too.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;Getting older is a privilege denied to many, but let's be honest about something. There's a massive difference between simply aging and aging well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see it all the time when I visit my parents and their friends. Some folks in their 70s are still climbing mountains and starting new businesses, while others the same age struggle with basic daily tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What separates these two groups? It's not just genetics or luck. After watching my own parents navigate their 60s and 70s, and spending countless hours with older adults through my volunteer work, I've noticed that those who maintain certain abilities well into their later years share something special. They possess a combination of physical capability, mental sharpness, and emotional resilience that truly makes them exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're over 65 and can still manage these 10 things without assistance, you're not just doing well. You're absolutely thriving in ways that many people half your age can't claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Managing your finances independently&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you still balance your checkbook, manage online banking, and make sound financial decisions without relying on others? This might sound basic, but financial literacy and independence become increasingly challenging as we age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent years as a financial analyst before becoming a writer, and I've seen how complex financial management can become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between changing technology, evolving scams, and the sheer volume of decisions required, maintaining financial independence requires sharp cognitive skills and adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to track expenses, understand investment statements, and spot potential fraud shows that your analytical thinking and decision-making abilities remain intact. Many people start handing over financial responsibilities to their children by this age, but if you're still confidently managing your money, you're demonstrating exceptional mental acuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Learning new technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when smartphones seemed impossibly complicated? Now think about the people over 65 who not only use them but actually embrace new apps, video calling, and social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're someone who can set up a new device, troubleshoot basic tech issues, and adapt to software updates without calling for help every time, you're in rare company. Research shows that continued learning, especially in unfamiliar areas like technology, helps maintain cognitive flexibility and may even delay age-related mental decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Driving safely at night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Night driving becomes increasingly difficult with age due to natural changes in vision and reaction times. If you're still comfortable and safe behind the wheel after dark, your visual processing and reflexes are functioning at a remarkably high level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't just about seeing clearly. It's about processing multiple streams of information simultaneously, making split-second decisions, and maintaining the confidence to navigate challenging conditions. Many people voluntarily give up night driving long before 65.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Maintaining a regular exercise routine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered trail running at 28 as a way to handle work stress, and now I log 20-30 miles weekly. But here's what amazes me: I regularly get passed on trails by runners in their 70s who move with more grace and endurance than people decades younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're over 65 and still maintaining a consistent exercise routine, whether it's swimming, hiking, yoga, or strength training, you're preserving not just physical health but also discipline and mental fortitude. The ability to push through discomfort and maintain motivation for physical activity becomes increasingly precious with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Cooking elaborate meals from scratch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooking involves so much more than following a recipe. It requires planning, multitasking, fine motor skills, and sensory awareness. Can you still prepare a holiday dinner for the family, trying new recipes and managing multiple dishes simultaneously?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This capability demonstrates intact executive functioning, creativity, and physical stamina. Standing for extended periods, chopping vegetables with precision, and coordinating timing for multiple dishes are complex tasks that many people begin to find overwhelming as they age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Traveling solo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solo travel at any age requires courage, but after 65, it demands exceptional self-reliance. Navigating airports, managing bookings, adapting to unexpected changes, and exploring new places independently showcase remarkable cognitive and physical resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're still comfortable setting off on adventures alone, trusting your judgment and ability to handle whatever comes your way, you possess a level of confidence and capability that many people lose long before reaching your age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Maintaining and nurturing friendships&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social connections often dwindle with age, but if you're actively maintaining friendships, making new friends, and nurturing these relationships without depending entirely on family for social interaction, you're demonstrating exceptional emotional intelligence and social skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This involves remembering important dates, initiating contact, planning gatherings, and being emotionally available for others. These seemingly simple acts require significant cognitive and emotional energy that many people find increasingly difficult to sustain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. Reading complex books and retaining information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you still dive into a dense novel or non-fiction book, follow intricate plots or arguments, and discuss them intelligently afterward? This level of sustained concentration and comprehension is increasingly rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading comprehension at this level requires working memory, focus, and the ability to connect new information with existing knowledge. If you're still eagerly tackling challenging books and retaining what you read, your cognitive reserves are remarkably well-preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. Managing home maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it's changing light bulbs, basic repairs, gardening, or organizing spaces, maintaining your living environment independently requires physical capability, problem-solving skills, and the confidence to tackle challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I helped my parents downsize, I was struck by how many of their peers had already surrendered these tasks to others. If you're still handling home maintenance yourself, you're demonstrating physical agility, spatial awareness, and the mental sharpness to troubleshoot problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. Advocating for yourself in medical settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare becomes increasingly complex with age. Can you still research your conditions, ask informed questions, challenge recommendations when necessary, and make confident decisions about your care?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requires processing complex medical information, remembering details across multiple appointments, and maintaining the assertiveness to ensure your voice is heard. Many people become passive in medical settings as they age, but if you're still your own best advocate, you possess exceptional cognitive function and self-confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you checked off most or all of these abilities, you truly are exceptional. These aren't just random skills; they represent the full spectrum of human capability: physical, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning at the highest level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's your secret? Maybe it's staying curious, remaining physically active, maintaining social connections, or simply refusing to accept limitations as inevitable. Whatever it is, keep doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you're younger and reading this, take note. The habits and attitudes you develop now lay the foundation for how you'll age. Every time you learn something new, push yourself physically, or maintain important relationships, you're investing in your future self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age might be just a number, but the ability to live fully and independently at any age? That's priceless.&lt;/p&gt;
