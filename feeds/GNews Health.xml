			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A discovery by researchers from the Baylor College of Medicine in the US could lead to treatments that clear the troublesome &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta"&gt;aggregations of protein&lt;/a&gt; thought to play a key role in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using mice bred to have a condition similar to the neurodegenerative disorder, the team found &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;that elevated levels of a protein called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOX9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sox9&lt;/a&gt; triggered specialized brain cells &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;to go into clean-up overdrive, 'vacuuming' up plaques with increased efficiency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In behavioral and memory tests, the treated mice also performed better, suggesting that the intervention can help protect the brain and reverse cognitive decline – a process that typically occurs in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="183244" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease as neurons are damaged and destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-one-critical-thing-you-can-do-to-keep-alzheimers-symptoms-at-bay"&gt;There's One Critical Thing You Can Do to Keep Alzheimer's Symptoms at Bay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the benefits of Sox9 &lt;span&gt;stemmed from increased expression of a receptor called MEGF10, exclusively expressed in the membranes of brain maintenance cells &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-cells-we-thought-were-just-fillers-might-actually-be-the-key-to-our-body-clocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;called astrocytes&lt;/a&gt;, which are deployed to remove&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-of-our-biggest-hopes-for-alzheimers-treatment-doesnt-seem-to-work"&gt;amyloid-beta plaques&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Astrocytes perform diverse tasks that are essential for normal brain function, including facilitating brain communications and memory storage," &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/news/brain-stars-hold-the-power-to-preserve-cognitive-function-in-model-of-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Dong-Joo Choi, previously at the Baylor College of Medicine and now at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the brain ages, astrocytes show profound functional alterations. However, the role these alterations play in aging and neurodegeneration is not yet understood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183247" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/BrainScans.jpg" alt="Mouse brain scan" class="wp-image-183247 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/BrainScans.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/BrainScans-600x251.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183247" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Boosting the production of Sox9 (right) reduced plaques (in red) in mouse brains.

The Sox9 protein has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.36129"&gt;previously been found&lt;/a&gt; elevated in Alzheimer's brains, which may indicate the brain's attempt to ramp up waste removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tried an opposite experiment, too, genetically engineering mice to remove Sox9. In these animals, the astrocytes showed signs of reduced health, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-may-now-know-why-alzheimers-erases-memories-of-our-loved-ones"&gt;memory recall worsened&lt;/a&gt;, and more amyloid-beta clumps stacked up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An important point of our experimental design is that we worked with mouse models of Alzheimer's disease that had already developed cognitive impairment, such as memory deficits, and had amyloid plaques in the brain," &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/news/brain-stars-hold-the-power-to-preserve-cognitive-function-in-model-of-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Choi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe these models are more relevant to what we see in many patients with Alzheimer's disease symptoms than other models in which these types of experiments are conducted before the plaques form."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are now tackling the challenge of Alzheimer's disease from numerous different angles, including treatments that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/supplement-for-high-blood-pressure-clears-signs-of-alzheimers-in-mice"&gt;target amyloid-beta plaques&lt;/a&gt;. However, not all of these &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-of-our-biggest-hopes-for-alzheimers-treatment-doesnt-seem-to-work"&gt;treatments work&lt;/a&gt;, emphasizing the complexity of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-new-compound-reverses-alzheimers-symptoms-in-rats"&gt;clear out amyloid-beta clumps&lt;/a&gt; or stop them from forming, but we're still not sure if these protein aggregations are causing Alzheimer's or just a result of the disease. All of these factors need to be weighed up by researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, each new study gets us closer to understanding how this disease progresses – and how, eventually, it might be stopped. Although these latest tests were carried out in mice rather than humans, there's good reason to believe scientists may have discovered a crucial new route to tackling the manifestations of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most current treatments focus on neurons or try to prevent the formation of amyloid plaques," &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/news/brain-stars-hold-the-power-to-preserve-cognitive-function-in-model-of-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Benjamin Deneen. "This study suggests that enhancing astrocytes' natural ability to clean up could be just as important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-02115-w"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration intends to get tougher on vaccine approvals, as top officials raised concerns about the risk of COVID vaccines for children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Speaking on Fox News Saturday morning, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization/martin-makary" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;FDA Commissioner Marty Makary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said the agency would no longer "rubber-stamp new products that don't work," claiming it made a "mockery of science."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Makary's comments came the day after FDA's top vaccine regulator, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization/vinay-prasad" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Vinay Prasad&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, told his team the agency would change its annual flu vaccine framework, update vaccine labels to be "honest," and make other changes to how it reviews vaccines, according to contents of an internal email reviewed by NPR and &lt;a href="https://x.com/AliRogin/status/1994567973030535301?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported on first&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;em&gt;PBS News Hour&lt;/em&gt; correspondent and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/29/fda-vaccine-approval-child-covid-deaths/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;later by&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Prasad wrote that the FDA would also no longer authorize vaccines for pregnant women without stricter requirements. And for pneumonia vaccines, manufacturers will have to prove they reduce disease rather than show they generate antibodies. He also raised questions about giving multiple vaccines at the same time, which is standard practice.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The changes could make it much more difficult and expensive for vaccines to get approved, further limiting the availability of vaccines, which are considered among the safest and most effective tools for protecting people against infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While all vaccines carry some risks, most public health experts argue the current process for vetting vaccines before marketing has long assured that the benefits of vaccines outweigh their risks. Studies required after vaccines are approved and surveillance systems, including the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/report-problem-center-biologics-evaluation-research/vaccine-adverse-events" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (VAERS), also flag potential safety issues once vaccines are in use.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;FDA says an analysis links COVID shots to some deaths&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Makary said on Fox News that 10 children had died from the COVID shot during the Biden administration, but did not offer specifics about how the FDA came to that conclusion. &lt;a href="https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Millions of children&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have received the vaccine.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Officials with the Department of Health and Human Services and Food and Drug Administration didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on the COVID analysis and changes to vaccine review standards.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to the FDA email from Prasad, he told the agency's biostatistics and pharmacovigilance team to analyze 96 reported deaths from 2021 to 2024, and they determined 10 children died "after and because of" the COVID vaccine. But Prasad said the true number was likely higher.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Offit, who &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;directs the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, said in a text message that Prasad has not shared the evidence that these vaccines killed 10 children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Because he doesn't provide any evidence, he is asking us to trust him on an important issue," Office said. "All this will do is scare people unnecessarily. At the very least, he should provide all the evidence he has so that experts in the field can review it and decide whether he has enough data to prove his point."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Jesse Goodman, &lt;a href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014TNITAA4/jesse-l-goodman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a professor at Georgetown University&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who held Prasad's job at FDA from 2003 until 2009, said in an email that the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which oversees vaccine approval, has been "recognized globally as a gold standard regulator." Goodman defended "immunologic endpoints like antibody levels" for the accelerated approval of pneumonia and influenza vaccines. He said science supports their use and they are confirmed with studies after approval: "These approaches have helped provide children and adults with timely access to safe and effective vaccines, saving many lives."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://directory.sph.umn.edu/bio/sph-a-z/michael-osterholm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Michael Osterholm&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, reviewed the email from Prasad and challenged his statement that "COVID-19 was never highly lethal for children." Osterholm also questioned the FDA's latest analysis of adverse event reports attributing the 10 deaths to COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Prasad's email is filled with factual mistakes and misrepresents both the severity of COVID in children (1597 deaths in 2020-2022) and how the US responded to the first signals of possible vaccine-associated pediatric deaths in May 2021," Osterholm wrote in an email to NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"While Prasad's email notes 10 such deaths, these cases have never been presented for review by the medical and public health communities or published in the medical literature," Osterholm continued. "Given the record of this Administration to misrepresent scientific data regarding vaccines, until these cases have been reviewed by an expert third party, like the National Academy of Science[s], we can not accept the fact they are vaccine-associated deaths."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Surveillance system collects vaccines reports&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The FDA makes public data from the VAERS surveillance system co-sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccine-adverse-events/vaccine-adverse-event-reporting-system-vaers-database-information" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;FDA cautions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, "it is important to note that for any reported event, no cause and effect relationship has been established." In his email, Prasad wrote that "with case reports, causality is typically assessed on a subjective scale. In this scale ranging from certain to unlikely -- certain, possible/likely, and probable are broadly considered as related to the product."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Makary said on Fox News that when the COVID shot was first rolled out, it was "amazing" for people at high risk of coming down with severe disease, but things have changed. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Back in 2020, we saw a reduction in the severity of illness and lives saved, but now recommending that a 6-year-old girl get another 70 million COVID shots – one each year for the rest of her life – is not based on science. And so we're not going to just rubber stamp approvals without seeing some scientific evidence."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The claim is the latest move by Trump administration health officials questioning the safety and effectiveness of vaccines and how the government has regulated them. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long questioned vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The FDA &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5515503/fda-covid-vaccines-restricted" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;restricted eligibility&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the updated COVID vaccines in August after announcing the agency planned to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/20/nx-s1-5405013/fda-covid-vaccine-limits" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;require more evidence &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;about the shots' safety and effectiveness going forward.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;CDC committee will meet to review vaccine policies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The FDA email on vaccine policy comes just before the CDC convenes a crucial &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;two-day meeting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of that agency's influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Dec. 4-5. The committee is in the process of conducting a major review of how children are inoculated against dangerous infectious diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, polio and hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many public health experts are concerned the committee will upend the childhood vaccination schedule. It could move to delay the timing of some inoculations, space out vaccinations and call for the reformulation of some vaccines. Taken together, the moves could result in fewer children getting protected and the resurgence of once-vanquished diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Asked about Makary and Prasad's claims that the COVID vaccine caused deaths among 10 children, Moderna, whose COVID vaccine is approved for children as young as 6 months old, pointed to a &lt;a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/statement-on-the-safety-of-spikevax" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement it made in September&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company says that multiple published, peer-reviewed studies from a variety of sources show its shot is safe and that it is "not aware of any deaths in the last year or pertinent new information from prior years."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Moderna says it monitors its vaccine's safety along with regulators in more than 90 countries. "With more than one billion doses distributed globally, these systems — including in national health systems across Europe, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the U.S. — have not reported any new or undisclosed safety concerns in children or in pregnant women."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pfizer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some chronic cannabis users, a case of the munchies is the least of their problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, ERs have seen a surge in regular tokers showing up with sudden, stomach-churning attacks that leave them doubled over in pain. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The worst part? Many sufferers experience these episodes three or four times a year, often leaving both patients and providers scratching their heads.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Chronic cannabis users are increasingly facing a temporarily debilitating health concern. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Seventyfour – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is CHS?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The culprit is cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), a gut-wrenching disorder that triggers relentless nausea, abdominal pain and severe vomiting that can strike four or five times an hour, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21665-cannabis-hyperemesis-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms usually appear within 24 hours of cannabis use and can last for days. The episodes are so brutal that ER staff have coined a term for them: “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6690288/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;scromiting&lt;/a&gt;” — a chilling mashup of screaming and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tough to treat&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite its growing prevalence, many doctors are still unfamiliar with the syndrome, which was only recently defined, making it hard to distinguish from medical issues like food poisoning or the stomach flu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A person often will have multiple [emergency department] visits until it is correctly recognized, costing thousands of dollars each time,” &lt;a href="https://adai.uw.edu/staff_members/bia-carlini/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Beatriz Carlini&lt;/a&gt;, a research associate professor at the University of Washington (UW) School of Medicine who studies adverse health effects of cannabis use, said in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251126095029.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome patients often present with the combination of screaming and loud vomiting, which has led to the term “scromiting.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Monkey Business – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But even after a diagnosis, CHS can be difficult to treat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are currently no FDA-approved therapies, and standard anti-nausea medications often don’t work, according to &lt;a href="https://em.uw.edu/people/faculty/christopher-buresh" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Chris Buresh&lt;/a&gt;, an emergency medicine specialist with UW Medicine and Seattle Children’s Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That sometimes forces clinicians to try second- and third-line options, including &lt;a href="https://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(20)30666-1/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Haldol&lt;/a&gt;, a medication more commonly used for psychotic episodes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some patients find limited relief by rubbing &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7718060/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;capsaicin cream&lt;/a&gt; on their stomachs, which creates a warming sensation that can temporarily ease discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Hot baths and showers also often help curb symptoms, with many patients driven to bathe for hours each day to soothe their pain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s something that can clinch the diagnosis for me, when someone says they’re better with a hot shower,” Buresh said. “Patients describe going through all the hot water in their house.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Recovery challenges&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even after symptoms subside, long-term recovery can be tricky. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because the syndrome strikes intermittently, some cannabis users assume a recent episode was unrelated and continue using — only to become severely ill again, according to UW. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those who accept the diagnosis and try to quit, addiction often makes abstinence a major challenge, prolonging the cycle of illness. Carlini said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stopping cannabis use is currently the only way to fully cure the condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;From teens to long-time users&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists don’t know the exact cause of CHS, but the leading theory is that long-term overstimulation of receptors in the endocannabinoid system may disrupt the body’s natural control of nausea and vomiting, per the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;CHS can be tough to spot, often blending in with far more common gastrointestinal illnesses. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Mdv Edwards – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why it affects some cannabis users but not others remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know if it’s related to the greater general availability of cannabis or the higher THC potency of some products or something else,” Buresh said.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It seems like there’s a threshold when people can become vulnerable to this condition, and that threshold is different for everyone,” he added. “Even using in small amounts can make these people start throwing up.” &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://emed.smhs.gwu.edu/news/painful-syndrome-sending-cannabis-users-er-are-you-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study published earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at George Washington University surveyed 1,052 people with CHS in an effort to better understand risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They found that starting cannabis use earlier in life was linked to a higher likelihood of future ER visits for hyperemesis symptoms. Daily use and prolonged consumption were also common, with 44% reporting regular use for more than five years before the syndrome appeared. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But CHS isn’t just an adult problem. &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2836403" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that emergency department visits among adolescents in the US have jumped more than 10-fold from 2016 to 2023.  &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Notably, while overall rates were higher in states with legal recreational cannabis, the fastest year-over-year increases in the number of adolescent CHS cases at hospitals occurred in states where casual cannabis use is still illegal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Gaining attention&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 1, the World Health Organization formally recognized cannabis hyperemesis syndrome, adding an official diagnosis code to its manual. The CDC has also incorporated the new code into US diagnostic systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts say the update offers several benefits, including giving researchers a clearer picture of how often CHS occurs. Having the code appear in a patient’s medical record also helps providers spot repeat episodes during future visits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A new code for cannabis hyperemesis syndrome will supply important hard evidence on cannabis-adverse events, which physicians tell us is a growing problem,” Carlini said. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Vinay Prasad, the director of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccine division, sent a memo to staff that linked children's deaths to the COVID-19 vaccine, but did not provide data to back the claim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memo said that a review "found that at least 10 children have died after and because of receiving COVID-19 vaccination," according to multiple sources familiar with the email. The memo was first reported by the New York Times.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad suggested that the deaths were related to myocarditis, or the inflammation of the heart muscle. Prasad did not share any data used in the review, including the children's ages, whether they had existing health conditions, or how the FDA determined there was a link between their death and the vaccine. The findings were not published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myocarditis has been linked to the COVID-19 vaccine, but &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2110475" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;studies have largely confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that the risk of the condition is significantly higher after a coronavirus infection, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccines-myocarditis-heart-damage-infection-children/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;pediatric cardiologists told CBS News in 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The prognosis following myocarditis due to the vaccine is also better than from infection, &lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/full/10.1016/j.jacc.2022.09.049" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt;.

Now, most people receive each dose of the vaccine about a year apart. If someone receives the primary series before age 5, the risk virtually disappears. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-covid-vaccine-mrna-heart-side-effects-warning-label/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;carry warnings about the risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of myocarditis or pericarditis, a condition where the membrane surrounding the heart becomes inflamed. The warnings were expanded in April 2025 to apply to males aged 16 to 25. The rate of myocarditis and pericarditis was around 8 cases per million doses for children and adults under 65 years old after use of that season's vaccines, the FDA said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 vaccines, developed during the first Trump administration, have become a target of the second. Top FDA officials selected by the administration under Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-vaccine-safety-aluminum-ingredients/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; overrode career staff to limit the approvals of COVID-19 shots from Novavax and Moderna, according to records released by the FDA. A &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention/" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; official said in June that she was &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-official-overseeing-covid-19-vaccine-recommendations-resigns/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;resigning from her role&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; overseeing updates to the agency's COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, following &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines-cdc-children-pregnant-women/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;an order&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from Kennedy that forced an update to the agency's guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kids-flu-covid-shots-fall-2025-vaccine-guidance-shifts/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Changing COVID-19 vaccination guidance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has caused confusion for many. The CDC's vaccine advisory committee, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-acip-recap-measles-mmrv-covid-vaccines/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;voted in September&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to change recommendations for the shot. All members of the committee have been picked by Kennedy, himself a vaccine skeptic. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-names/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Several of the panel members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have criticized the COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updated CDC guidance recommends people make individual, informed decisions about COVID-19 vaccination, but did not specifically recommend the shots. The &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-shot-recommendations-american-academy-of-pediatrics-cdc/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said it was "strongly recommending" shots for children between 6 months and 2 years old, while the &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/ID-topics/infectious-disease/covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Infectious Diseases Society of America&lt;/a&gt; recommended the vaccine for everyone six months and older. State governments have also banded together, forming the &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Immunization/IMM-1481.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;West Coast Health Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2025/announce-northeast-public-health-collaborative.page" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Northeast Public Health Collaborative&lt;/a&gt;, to issue recommendations that differ from the CDC guidance. &lt;/p&gt;

In it, Prasad claims that agency staff determined that “no fewer than 10” of 96 child deaths reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, between 2021 and 2024 were “related” to Covid vaccination. He said the true numbers could be higher, accusing the agency of ignoring the safety concerns for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f73a77" class="body-graf"&gt;The memo, sent Friday, did not include the children’s ages or medical histories, timelines or documentation for the deaths he references and does not identify the manufacturer of the vaccine. The FDA’s findings have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-c40629" class="body-heading"&gt;Experts push back&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-707cd0" class="body-graf"&gt;Experts who reviewed the memo say it is misusing information from VAERS, an unverified reporting system that allows anyone, including doctors, patients and caregivers, to submit entries  about adverse events they believe are linked to vaccines. The system’s &lt;a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;own website&lt;/a&gt; warns that submissions can contain inaccurate, incomplete or biased information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-925f0d" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is sort of science by press release,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, calling the memo “irresponsible” and “dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3a5066" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is a profound revelation,” Prasad wrote in the memo. “For the first time, the U.S. FDA will acknowledge that COVID-19 vaccines have killed American children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e946e8" class="body-graf"&gt;Prasad suggests that the child deaths were tied to myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, but doesn’t include evidence to support the claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1c1d2b" class="body-graf"&gt;The FDA directed all media inquiries to the Department of Health and Human Services. An HHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-be31a9" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA’s former vaccine chief who was ousted by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. earlier this year, said the agency is misusing the database and the claims are right out of what he calls the “anti-vaccine playbook.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b49966" class="body-graf"&gt;The FDA uses the database to look for early “signals” — patterns that might suggest a possible safety issue, Marks told NBC News. It was one of the tools the agency used to identify a rare blood clotting condition linked to Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s Covid vaccine, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c4551e" class="body-graf"&gt;The mRNA Covid vaccines, from Pfizer and Moderna, have also been linked to a small but increased risk of myocarditis in young men. Most cases &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/myocarditis-covid-vaccine-teens-study-rcna60118" target="_blank"&gt;have been found to be mild&lt;/a&gt; and resolve within a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e18af0" class="body-graf"&gt;Marks said the FDA is not reviewing new safety reports but instead re-examining older ones and appears to be classifying some of them as vaccine-related. He added that Covid infection is also associated with myocarditis — and is often more severe than cases seen after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4519ab" class="body-graf"&gt;“This memo conveys a very troubling mixture of misrepresentation and lies,” Marks said. “The climate within the agency is incredibly toxic right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-a55299" class="body-heading"&gt;Proposed changes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7c12e2" class="body-graf"&gt;The memo uses highly ideological language, repeatedly characterizing Covid vaccine requirements for schools and employers as “coercive,” calling past agency decisions “dishonest,” and arguing that vaccine regulation “may have harmed more children than we saved.” At one point, Prasad instructs staff who disagree with his conclusions to resign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fee3fd" class="body-graf"&gt;He outlined a series of proposed changes to how the FDA evaluates vaccines. He said the agency would revisit how annual flu shots are evaluated, calling the current process an “evidence-based catastrophe of low quality evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-21292b" class="body-graf"&gt;He also said pneumonia vaccine makers “will have to show their products reduce pneumonia (at least in the post-market setting), and not merely generate antibody titers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-293c74" class="body-graf"&gt;He also claimed the Biden administration dismissed early safety concerns, and criticized former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky for what he described as “dishonest and manipulative” public comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3cb084" class="body-graf"&gt;The memo comes ahead of a two-day CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting next week, when officials are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-11-14-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;scheduled to discuss the childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt; and the hepatitis B shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4ebbee" class="body-graf"&gt;Earlier this year, the FDA and CDC limited who is eligible to get a Covid vaccine this fall and winter, focusing on people 65 and older and those with medical conditions that put them at increased risk of severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fd593d" class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy, an anti-vaccine activist, has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085"&gt;downplayed the benefits of vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and has singled out vaccines made with mRNA as particularly dangerous, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-vaccine-kids-pregnant-women-cdc-recommendation-rfk-jr-rcna207312"&gt;calling the mRNA Covid vaccine&lt;/a&gt; “the deadliest vaccine ever made.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2f462f" class="body-graf"&gt;In September, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/04/health/video/the-lead-marty-makary-health-rfk-jr-hhs-congress-hearing-jake-tapper"&gt;FDA Commissioner Marty Makary told CNN&lt;/a&gt; that the agency was looking into the deaths of healthy children from the Covid shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6146b4" class="body-graf"&gt;Extensive research has found that the Covid vaccines are safe for children and protect against severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a4053b" class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9871947/" target="_blank"&gt;2023 analysis in JAMA Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; reviewed 17 studies covering more than 10 million children ages 5 to 11 who got Pfizer’s or Moderna’s Covid vaccines.

His research focuses on how the brain’s neural circuits assemble themselves before sensory experience shapes them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists have known for years that brain activity in adults is not just random noise – it follows structured sequences when animals move, remember, or rest quietly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classic &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; in rodents showed that hippocampal cells can “preplay” paths an animal will walk, suggesting activity patterns exist before experiences arrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those repeating chains are called neuronal firing sequences (&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/time-cells-in-the-brain-are-key-to-complex-learning/"&gt;NFS&lt;/a&gt;), which are ordered bursts of nerve cell spikes over very short periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are thought to be units the brain uses to send information from one place to another and to stitch events in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have argued over whether these sequences appear only after months of sensory input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharf and his collaborators set out to test if any are present before a brain has had the chance to sense the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-growing-mini-brains"&gt;Growing mini brains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tackle that question, the group turned to organoids that can mimic parts of the human cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41420-023-01523-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;

from Sharf and colleagues showed that brain organoids form circuits where neurons connect, synchronize, and react to drugs that shift activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those findings suggested that these models are not just static tissue samples but active networks that can learn and change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1934590919303376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that cortical organoids gradually develop complex oscillatory waves that resemble patterns seen in preterm infant brain recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with the new work, these results strengthen the idea that organoid networks follow internally guided programs as they mature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments, the team grew organoids from human stem cells and placed slices of tissue onto &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-computer-interface-bci-reads-your-innermost-thoughts-and-translates-them-into-text/"&gt;microelectrode arrays&lt;/a&gt;, which are flat chips with many recording sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those arrays let the researchers separate signals from hundreds of neurons at once and follow how each cell fired over minutes of spontaneous activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-brain-circuit-sequences"&gt;Early brain circuit sequences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they looked at these recordings, the scientists saw that bursts of activity swept through organoids in ordered steps, rather than as random flashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each burst followed a specific schedule, with some neurons firing early and others firing late, forming sequences that match a built in wiring plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within those patterns, the analysis revealed a fraction of cells that fired on every burst in a fixed order, creating backbone for the sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many other cells participated sometimes or at varying times, adding flexibility around that backbone so the network could explore combinations without losing its rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing of these sequences resembled patterns measured in adult cortex, where spontaneous events outline the range of sensory responses a circuit can produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These cells are clearly interacting with each other and forming circuits that self-assemble before we can experience anything from the outside world,” said Sharf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That isolation from outside input means the ordered firing reflects sequence rules encoded in the brain circuit network itself not carved by experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea fits with a view in developmental neuroscience that some circuits start with scaffolds which later get tuned by senses and by learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-lab-to-newborn-mice"&gt;From lab to newborn mice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see if patterns arise in brain tissue, the researchers recorded from slices of the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mice-capable-empathy/"&gt;somatosensory cortex&lt;/a&gt; in mice, which is tissue that processes touch signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mice were at an age when most senses besides smell are still developing, so their cortices had received only limited outside input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those slices, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/our-decisions-are-shaped-by-optimistic-and-pessimistic-neurons/"&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; fired in recurring bursts that unfolded in the same order, with a backbone of cells leading the wave and others joining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That parallel between organoids and living tissue strengthens the case that the underlying sequence rules are built into the way these circuits grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In flat cultures of cortical neurons, the cells produced bursts of activity but lacked the ordered sequences that appeared in organoids and slices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That contrast suggests that having a three-dimensional layout with diverse cell types is important for letting backbone sequences form and persist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar timing motifs in lab grown human tissue and early mouse cortex argue that sequence-based organization is a general feature of mammalian brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It supports the idea that evolution has shaped the brain’s neural circuits so they can assemble maps of time, even before an individual encounters the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implications-of-preconfigured-brains"&gt;Implications of preconfigured brains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these mini-brains develop from patient or healthy stem cells, researchers can compare how sequences unfold in organoids from people with different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a disorder changes when backbone cells fire, or how cells join a sequence, those changes could expose assembly problems before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organoid-based models let scientists probe disorders, including microcephaly and epilepsy, giving access to stages of brain growth that cannot be studied directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding precise measurements of early-firing sequences to that toolkit could help explain why some conditions disturb perception, movement, or cognition from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These recording platforms can track how sequences change after a drug or gene edit, letting researchers search for treatments that restore normal timing patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That approach could be especially valuable for disorders where current medicines blunt symptoms, but don’t correct the underlying wiring problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the organoid recordings, neonatal mouse slices, and flat culture comparisons point to a brain that starts life with preconfigured firing rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding those rules could clarify how infants rapidly learn, and could open paths to treating disorders while the brain is still assembling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02111-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

While lifestyle, sleep and stress remain central pillars of healthy ageing, certain supplements can give the body what modern diets often lack. Dr Jenna Macciochi, a UK-based immunologist, recently shared in an Instagram post that a targeted supplement routine can strengthen immune resilience and support healthier, slower ageing. Her nine-part regimen focuses on boosting energy, improving gut balance and calming inflammation, all of which become increasingly important as people move through 40s and 50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9 supplements that can slow ageing and boost energy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;CoQ10: The energy catalyst&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;CoQ10 plays a central role in mitochondrial function, which powers every cell in the body. Levels naturally decline with age, reducing energy and increasing oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why it helps: It supports heart health, reduces fatigue and improves cellular energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; How to take it: Most adults use 100–200 mg daily, preferably in a softgel with oil for better absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; How to include it: Take it with a meal containing healthy fats such as avocado, nuts or olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Omega-3 and 7: Healthy fats for healthy cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation, support brain function and improve heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-7 helps maintain skin and mucosal barrier health — something that weakens with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why it helps: These oils improve cell membrane flexibility, boost immune signalling and support overall metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; How to take it: Fish oil, algae oil for vegetarians, or supplements combining omega-3 and omega-7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; How to include it: Complement supplements with fatty fish like salmon or with flaxseed, chia and walnuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin D and K: The essential duo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D supports immunity, mood, muscle strength and bone density. Vitamin K2 ensures that calcium absorbed through vitamin D is deposited in the bones, not soft tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why it helps: Prevents bone loss, supports immune balance and improves inflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; How to take it: Look for vitamin D3 paired with K2 (MK-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; How to include it: Spend regular time in sunlight, eat fortified foods and take a daily D3 + K2 capsule or spray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Creatine and taurine: Power and recovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine boosts strength, muscle mass and cognitive performance by helping replenish ATP, the body’s quick energy source. Taurine hydrates cells, stabilises mitochondria and supports recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why it helps: Great for preserving muscle as you age and improving mental clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; How to take it: Creatine monohydrate (3–5 g daily) and taurine (500–1000 mg).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; How to include it: Mix creatine into water, smoothies or coffee; taurine works best taken in capsules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Magnesium: The all-round regulator&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium supports over 300 biochemical reactions, including muscle relaxation, sleep, nerve function and energy production. Many adults are unknowingly deficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why it helps: Improves sleep, reduces stress, eases muscle cramps and supports heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; How to take it: Magnesium glycinate for sleep and stress, citrate for digestion and malate for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; How to include it: Add leafy greens, pumpkin seeds, almonds and whole grains to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Targeted gut support&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ageing weakens the gut barrier and reduces microbial diversity, affecting immunity and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why it helps: A stronger gut means better nutrient absorption, stable mood and reduced inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; How to take it: Look for prebiotics, postbiotics or specific gut-support formulas focused on barrier integrity rather than generic probiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; How to include it: Eat fermented foods like yoghurt, kefir, sauerkraut and fibre-rich vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Spermidine: A longevity molecule&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spermidine triggers autophagy, the body’s natural process of clearing damaged cells and regenerating new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why it helps: Supports cellular repair, brain health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; How to take it: Typically in supplement capsules derived from wheat germ or plant extracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; How to include it: Food sources include wheat germ, mushrooms, soybeans and aged cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Quercetin: Anti-inflammatory support&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quercetin is a plant antioxidant that reduces inflammation, supports blood vessels and aids immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why it helps: Helps reduce oxidative stress, supports metabolic health and may improve allergy symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; How to take it: Usually taken as a capsule (250–500 mg). Works even better when paired with vitamin C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="95"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; How to include it: Add onions, apples, berries and capers to your meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="97"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fisetin: Clearing old cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="99"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fisetin helps remove senescent cells, which accumulate with age and contribute to chronic inflammation and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="101"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Why it helps: Supports healthier ageing, better recovery and improved metabolic function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="104"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; How to take it: Often available in 100–200 mg capsules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="106"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; How to include it: Naturally found in strawberries, apples, persimmons and cucumbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="108"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr Macciochi reminds us, supplements are not magic fixes, but they can help fill the gaps created by modern living and the natural shifts that come with age. Paired with good sleep, movement and balanced eating, these nine additions can support a more resilient immune system and a steadier, stronger body through your 40s and 50s. For many people, it’s about giving the body the quiet, consistent support it needs to age well from the inside out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="112"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

I went through a long, arduous menopause, more than 10 years of pure hell. The killers weren’t the chills, night sweats or insomnia, though inadequate sleep does make you a little wonky. It was the major depression that almost did me in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RSQOVWSOIJAJJFRF7IXFZEBLVM"&gt;I finally consulted a physician who was a specialist in bioidentical hormone replacement. She did very thorough testing and balanced my female hormone levels. She also added a tiny dose of testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Y4BFG4IW7BAEJJK7YD2Q7ZM77Y"&gt;The results were nothing short of miraculous. I came out of the fog of depression almost overnight. That was after a decade of suffering. I had energy to exercise and dance again. And I could sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KQVMONYA4JFPZFHJTS6VW2ZXDQ"&gt;Balancing out my hormones plus adding a dash of testosterone may have saved my sanity, if not my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="COYEVY5WDFFIBBKZN7CIK2374U"&gt;A. Thank you for sharing such a compelling story. The Food and Drug Administration recently announced that it would be removing the black box safety warnings on hormone therapy. FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary agrees with you. He has pointed out that many women experience debilitating symptoms during menopause, including severe depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="B2DOKOIGV5B3HFI6BIZW46PIYA"&gt;The current discussion of hormone replacement therapy rarely mentions testosterone, although women also make this “male” hormone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KDGNOPTE7VECTPBRJZNNMUOFAQ"&gt;A study in the British Journal of Psychiatry (June 16, 2025) found that hormone therapy, including testosterone, helped ease depression in menopausal women. A comprehensive review of the medical literature in the journal Cureus (Aug. 28, 2024) also concluded that testosterone can be helpful, especially for easing vaginal dryness and improving sexual desire and satisfaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM" data-fusion-component="FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM" data-fusion-component="FGETUJH3HVFI7MSM2JXJU3CXBM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SOVMSS6W6JEQ3JQSZVRX5423TQ"&gt;Q. I am on rosuvastatin to lower my cholesterol. Of the several side effects I am experiencing, constipation is the showstopper. I take magnesium and a stool softener plus laxatives just to poop every two to three days. Do you have any suggestions to help control constipation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="O7L4J26XUVASTPMXMJQ5SXRB3M"&gt;A. Constipation can be a side effect of many medications, including statins like rosuvastatin (Crestor). A different cholesterol-lowering drug might be less likely to cause this complication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="I77ARYTTT5DBHJZQIKS6TBRNSQ"&gt;You might also want to consider taking the soluble fiber psyllium (Metamucil).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November is Alzheimer’s Awareness Month&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Contributed Photo&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;JOHNSTON COUNTY – For Johnston County Registrar of Deeds Craig Olive and his blended family, Alzheimer’s disease is personal. He and his kin have seen the disease ravage parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts and uncles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Olive lost his mother, Pearl Thompson Brown Olive, to Alzheimer’s in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“She helped raise 15 children altogether — stepchildren and her own,” he recalls in an interview from his office in the Johnston County Courthouse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Pearl was more than his mom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“At age 45, she went back to school and got her nursing degree at what was then Johnston Technical College,” Olive says. “She then worked 16 years as a nurse at WakeMed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve got a scholarship in her name at the college,” a proud Olive adds. “And they even named a room after her.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in her early 70s, Alzheimer’s began robbing him of the mother and woman he knew. She did and said inexplicable things, Olive says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“She put utensils in the trashcan,” he recalls. “She walked out into the median of Highway 70. She’d say she had to go pick my brother up from work, something she hadn’t had to do in years.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His mother had been a regular at what was then the Clayton Senior Center, now the Clayton Center for Active Aging. “But we had to stop that,” Olive says, explaining that his mother became too much for staff to handle. “Mama was wandering around, even going into the men’s bathroom by mistake.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Olive became his mother’s caregiver, but he had help. “My mother was going to an adult day care program over here at First Baptist Church and then at Divine Destiny, another adult day care,” he says. “That was a big help for me.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But then his mother suffered a brain bleed in a fall, and Olive had to keep her at home. “She was never like she had been before,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After his mother’s fall, Olive turned to in-home care for help, and he sang the praises of those caregivers, including Martha Godwin. “She’s like family,” he says all these years later. “She was a jewel, and Camille Hunter too.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those who can afford it, Olive recommends in-home care. “I have nothing against nursing homes,” he says. “I just wish they had more staff members.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For caregivers, Olive recommends self-care. “You need to allow time for yourself,” he says, “because it can take a toll. You’re under stress, worrying all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Caregivers can find themselves sacrificing things that gave them joy, adds Olive, who most recently found himself caring for a brother who died earlier this year of kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I love the beach, and I haven’t been to the beach in four years because of being a caregiver,” he says. “You need to get away from the whole situation and give yourself time to do things,” Olive says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And by all means, take advantage of the resources available, he says. “It’s a long, lonely, hard road,” Olive says of Alzheimer’s caregiving.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For help and advice, he turned to his mother’s doctors, Community &amp;amp; Senior Services of Johnston County, the state’s Division of Aging, the Johnston County Department of Social Services and the N.C. Alzheimer’s Association.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It made the journey a lot easier,” Olive says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A daughter’s story&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Early on, Melanie Nunn and her siblings thought their mother, Brenda Ann Brown Dixon, was suffering from hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://jocoreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Brenda-Ann-Brown-cp.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-200138" srcset="https://jocoreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Brenda-Ann-Brown-cp.jpg 580w, https://jocoreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Brenda-Ann-Brown-cp-244x300.jpg 244w, https://jocoreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Brenda-Ann-Brown-cp-122x150.jpg 122w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Craig Olive’s sister, Brenda Ann Brown Dixon. Contributed Photo&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Conversations over the telephone became different and shorter than usual,” recalls Nunn, niece of Johnston County Registrar of Deeds Craig Olive. “We even pursued getting her hearing aids, but they didn’t help.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the family was also aware that a far worse diagnosis was possible. “We knew fairly early that mom had the possibility of developing dementia as I talked her into getting an APO-E blood test,” Nunn says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The test determines a person’s genetic risk for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Her result came back as a 3/4,” Nunn says. “This meant mom was most likely going to develop dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And her mom’s doctor confirmed an early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m thankful for the blood test and knowing early that mom had a high probability of developing dementia,” Nunn says. “This allowed us to prepare as much as we could and to really cherish our time together while she still had some clarity of mind.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because the diagnosis was early, her mom was able to remain at home, where Nunn’s dad was her main caregiver.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Since I lived close by, I gave dad breaks a few times a week for a few hours,” Nunn says. “I would wash and style mom’s hair and make sure she got a good bath and her hygiene was taken care of.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her mom found it hard to decide which outfit to wear each day. “So we went through her closet and paired outfits — tops with pants were hung together — and narrowed her choices to five,” Nunn says. “This helped her and my dad immensely.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her father needed more help than he admitted. “He didn’t want us to worry,” Nunn says. “Mom had always done the laundry, cooking, house cleaning, etc. He really tried, but meals became pickups from restaurants.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the disease progressed, her mother changed. “Mom started having bathroom accidents and asking repetitive questions,” Nunn says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her personality changed too. “She was initially an introvert but became more of an extrovert who spoke her mind in love,” says Nunn, who also changed. “I became a fierce protector and advocate for my mom.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And when her father died in 2020, Nunn became her mother’s chief caregiver. “Mom came to live with my family and I for 16 months, until she needed more care than I could give her,” she says. “I wasn’t able to care for her full time, care for two kids at home, homeschool them and be a full-time wife.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Putting her mom in a skilled nursing home was hard but necessary, Nunn says. “I experienced so much guilt but knew that placing her in a facility where she would have access to therapy would be helpful,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a real sense, the daughter became the mother in terms of care. “But the respect I had for her as my mom never dwindled,” Nunn says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“During her time with dementia, the Lord taught me so much through her,” she adds. “Mom handled the declines that came with dementia with such grace.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the woman and mother she knew slipped away. “I truly missed opportunities to have meaningful conversations with my mom,” Nunn says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As she cared for her mom amid her decline, Nunn found comfort in daily walks — “a great way to relieve stress,” she says — and in her faith. “I talked to God and read the Bible daily,” Nunn says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I knew I needed his strength and I couldn’t be all that mom needed me to be without him.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nunn also took part in online grief counseling. “I started this after my dad passed away and I began caring for mom,” she says. “I had godly friends from my church who prayed for me, listened to me and helped me care for mom to give me a break.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nunn is grateful too for the support she received from her husband and children. “My husband treated and loved my mom like his own,” she says. “He also took over household chores so I could spend time with mom. He was my eyes and kept me accountable to eat well, continue to exercise and seek out help when I needed it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Caring for someone with Alzheimer’s is a labor of love, Nunn says. “It’s hard and emotional, but so worth it,” she says. “Cherish every day.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nunn has this advice for caregivers of dementia sufferers. “Make life as normal as possible for them because change is hard for someone with dementia,” she says. “Hug them and express your love to them. They can still hear and feel.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the nursing home, Nunn decorated her mom’s room much like her room back home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I took her to get her nails done, kept her dressed in the best clothes — if you look good, you feel good — took her out to get ice cream, pushed her in her wheel chair outside every day to get her into the sunshine and took her to church almost every week,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At church, her mother was much like her old self, Nunn says. “Taking my mom to church gave me back my mom for a few hours each week,” she says. “She could enter the church confused, but when the worship music started and the preacher preached, it was like the Holy Spirit made the confusion dissipate and mom was present. It was so cool to watch.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For anyone starting the caregiver journey, Nunn has plenty of advice. “Ask for help early on,” she says. “Take pictures with your loved one as much as possible, record their voice in videos, have your loved one write letters to their children, grandchildren, friends before they are unable to express themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though dementia eventually claimed her mother’s memory, Nunn says she never forgot her husband, Don Dixon, and her Savior, Jesus Christ. “She talked about dad frequently and told others about her love for Jesus,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that’s how she hopes people will remember her mom. “She loved Jesus and trusted him completely, even in this diagnosis,” Nunn says. “And she loved her family.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Meghan Jenkins had her hands full with her toddler, Malachi. He was energetic and inquisitive, eager to explore the world around him. He loved anything to do with the Miami Dolphins and played constantly with dinosaurs and monster trucks. He was settling in at day care while Jenkins returned to work after taking a year off. Life was busy, but happy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2021, Jenkins noticed Malachi was tired and lethargic. He also had a lingering cough. One day, he threw up. When Jenkins changed his diaper, she found black stool. Immediately concerned, she and Malachi went straight to the emergency room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things moved quickly then, Jenkins said. Malachi was "connected to all these cords." Someone said he might need a blood transfusion. Hours passed with no answers. Jenkins grew more scared by the minute. Finally, Malachi was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, where doctors performed a bone marrow biopsy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a doctor sat Jenkins down for the diagnosis: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia. She was told her little boy's life expectancy could be just two and a half to three more years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In that moment, you question God. You ask him 'Why did this happen?'" Jenkins said. "I was so lost. This was my only child. I was young still, going through life, trying to figure things out. And then I had a big hit." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

  &lt;h2&gt;What is acute lymphoblastic leukemia? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, is a rare cancer that starts in the bone marrow, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/acute-lymphocytic-leukemia/about/what-is-all.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the American Cancer Society's website&lt;/a&gt;. Only about 6,100 new cases of ALL are diagnosed a year, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/acute-lymphocytic-leukemia/about/key-statistics.html#:~:text=About%206%2C100%20new%20cases%20of,males%20and%20680%20in%20females)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;, with children under the age of 5 having the highest risk of developing the disease. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALL is a fast-growing cancer that results in the body producing immature white blood cells. Malachi's white blood cell count was more than 10 times higher than it should be. The white blood cells were crowding out healthy cells, weakening his immune system and making it impossible for his body to fight off infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALL can quickly spread throughout the body and affect the lymph nodes, liver, spleen and other organs, as well as the central nervous system. Because the cancer grows so quickly, immediate treatment is key. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malachi was already "quite sick" when he was diagnosed, said Dr. Julio Barredo, the director of pediatric cancer programs at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. She started Malachi on chemotherapy immediately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first month of treatment, Malachi was hospitalized. The first weeks of chemotherapy are intense, so staying in the hospital is often safer, said pediatric hematologist Dr. Aditi Dhir. Malachi had side effects including nausea and fatigue. He regressed in his potty training. Jenkins needed to wear gloves to hold him because of his compromised immune system. The toddler milestones she'd expected to celebrate were nowhere to be seen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There were days I didn't even think I was going to go on, but I had to," Jenkins said. "It was stressful. It was depressing, constantly being in there." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Still, the chemotherapy was clearly helping Malachi, Dhir said. She recalled seeing him run around the PICU within a week of starting treatment. Barredo said that Malachi handled the chemotherapy "as well as anybody could have handled it given the circumstances." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the first month, Malachi continued chemotherapy at home. He took eight medications a day, Jenkins said, and spent several days a week in the hospital. Next came the "maintenance" phase, Barredo said. During this time, Malachi remained on oral medication and only needed to go to the hospital every few weeks, Dhir explained. The maintenance phase lasted for two years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, in August 2023, "the storm blew over," Jenkins said. Malachi was able to ring the bell that signified the completion of cancer treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"You can't tell he ever had leukemia" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Malachi is a "very loving" 7-year-old who excels in school, takes gifted classes and regularly appears on the honor roll, Jenkins said. He still cheers for the Dolphins and plays with dinosaurs and trucks. He's become a big reader and loves to share fun facts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, he is in remission. With acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the highest risk of relapse is within the first year of completing therapy, Barredo said. Malachi passed that milestone with flying colors. There's "some risk" of relapse in the second year, Barredo said, but Malachi and Jenkins marked that in August without incident. After two years, it "is quite unusual" for an ALL patient to relapse, Barredo said. Malachi has outperformed his initial prognosis, and the success of his treatment means "his life expectancy is like that of any other kid his age." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"You look at him, you can't tell he ever had leukemia," Barredo said. "For all practical purposes, he is pretty much cured at this point in time. ... He'll be able to do whatever he wants to do." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malachi's immune system remains compromised, Jenkins said, but she hopes to build it up so can have a normal childhood going forward. The family is looking forward to "finally blossoming" after the years of treatment and trauma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This whole process was very hard. It's still hard. I have moments sometimes where I'm in shock, like I don't believe we went through this or this even happened," Jenkins said. "But there is a brighter situation. Every situation doesn't have this outcome. But there are brighter outcomes. There are happier days than just being in the hospital and being sad." &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;"How often do you poop?" might sound like a very personal question, but your answer could reveal quite a lot about your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in July 2024 investigated how often 1,425 people went number two, and compared those stats to their demographic, genetic, and health data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The healthiest participants reported pooping once or twice a day – a 'Goldilocks zone' of bowel movement frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pooping too often or too rarely were both associated with different underlying health issues, the team led by researchers at the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/something-in-your-poop-may-predict-an-imminent-death?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Something in Your Poop May Predict an Imminent Death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study shows how bowel movement frequency can influence all body systems, and how aberrant bowel movement frequency may be an important risk factor in the development of chronic diseases," &lt;a href="https://isbscience.org/news/health/timing-is-everything-isb-study-finds-link-between-bowel-movement-frequency-and-overall-health/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; ISB microbiologist Sean Gibbons, the corresponding author of the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These insights could inform strategies for managing bowel movement frequency, even in healthy populations, to optimize health and wellness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study investigated the bathroom habits of people who were "generally healthy" – that is, with no history of kidney or gut issues like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-7-common-daily-habits-could-be-damaging-your-kidneys"&gt;kidney disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-have-sussed-out-a-driving-mechanism-behind-irritable-bowel-syndrome"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/blood-tests-can-reveal-crohns-disease-8-years-before-diagnosis"&gt;Crohn's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants self-reported how often they dropped the kids off at the pool, and the researchers organized them into four categories: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-constipation-could-be-having-a-serious-impact-on-your-heart"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt; for those reporting one or two bowel movements per week; low-normal for three to six movements per week; high-normal for one to three movements per day; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/severe-diarrhea-cases-surging-across-uk-and-scientists-dont-know-why"&gt;diarrhea&lt;/a&gt; for four or more watery stools per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also analyzed patients' blood metabolites and chemistry, their genetics, and the gut microbes present in their stool samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_132891" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132891" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-642x578.jpg" alt="A graphic depicting the studied variables" class="size-medium wp-image-132891" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-642x578.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-461x415.jpg 461w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-600x540.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1.jpg 765w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132891" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Participants provided samples of blood plasma and stool, in addition to filling out extensive diet, health, and lifestyle questionnaires.

But even accounting for these factors, people with constipation or diarrhea showed clear links to underlying health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria usually found in the upper gastrointestinal tract were more common in stool samples from participants with diarrhea.

Those who gained the most strength showed changes in the makeup of their gut bacteria in just eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These kinds of changes might help some people move out of the constipation or diarrhea categories and into a healthier bowel-movement range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those in the Goldilocks zone of pooping reported eating more fiber, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/first-of-its-kind-study-lists-health-benefits-of-drinking-more-water-each-day"&gt;drinking more water&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pooping-before-you-exercise-has-an-incredible-effect-on-performance"&gt;exercising more often&lt;/a&gt;.

She didn’t notice any symptoms. She also didn’t match the standard profile for head and neck cancer, which is twice as common among men and often diagnosed in people over age 50. Pascale, now 50, was diagnosed at 43 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TZZMUJYVIRDGBHYVQ2DPCXNJS4"&gt;Head and neck cancer impacts thousands of people each year in the United States. In 2025, an estimated 72,680 people in the U.S. will receive a diagnosis of cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx, the major types of head and neck cancer, according to the &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6NN5BC2X25G2XP5HSSIYKHGOWQ"&gt;Alcohol and tobacco use are two of the most important risk factors for head and neck cancers. However, a large portion of new head and neck diagnoses are being driven by cancer-causing types of human papillomavirus, or HPV, according to an &lt;a href="https://www.facs.org/for-medical-professionals/news-publications/news-and-articles/bulletin/2025/october-2025-volume-110-issue-9/rising-incidence-of-head-and-neck-cancer-drives-treatment-advances/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.facs.org/for-medical-professionals/news-publications/news-and-articles/bulletin/2025/october-2025-volume-110-issue-9/rising-incidence-of-head-and-neck-cancer-drives-treatment-advances/"&gt;Oct. 30 article&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Bulletin of the American College of Surgeons&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="K7M5HZXI2BFNJA7HJ75DNN3DFI"&gt;Pascale was diagnosed with a type of HPV-related head and neck cancer. Within months of her diagnosis, Pascale underwent three surgeries to remove the cancerous mass in her neck, cut out parts of her tonsils and the back of her tongue, and take out her lymph nodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CVVS4M3E5JDKBEDKMKGI2L5IUQ"&gt;“The surgeries were really painful, especially the second one. My sister is strong, but that one was bad,” said Maria Durante, Pascale’s sister. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XAJ2LVIS6FBTJPWYUBS3U6DNZU"&gt;The surgeries were brutal, but they seemed effective at removing the cancer. Then, one day in 2021, Pascale began to have difficulty swallowing. It felt like food getting stuck in her throat. A CT scan revealed a mass around her esophagus. This time, Pascale said, she underwent chemotherapy and radiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RJXTB2F6ERF5HAAUWVFVXYG2UE"&gt;Two years later, she learned the cancer had metastasized to the lungs. More chemotherapy followed, but it was less effective at shrinking her tumors. Then, at the start of 2024, Pascale developed an allergic reaction to her chemotherapy treatment. She felt defeated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7XDH3OUFDNGC3LSMT2YDTP3XBU"&gt;“I didn’t have any hope because all of the traditional treatments, they were not working for me,” said Pascale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EJR3TRIFH5HZXMFS4VFLDLR7XY"&gt;That’s when her oncologist at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital mentioned a clinical trial at Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBarnabas Health that was using cellular therapy to treat advanced HPV-related cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XJNESOWNH5GVXBCVY2PCHZTPUU"&gt;Cellular therapy has generated a lot of excitement in recent years, especially &lt;a href="https://www.nj.com/healthfit/2025/06/a-revolutionary-drug-made-in-nj-is-giving-cancer-patients-years-of-their-lives-back.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.nj.com/healthfit/2025/06/a-revolutionary-drug-made-in-nj-is-giving-cancer-patients-years-of-their-lives-back.html"&gt;CAR T-cell therapy&lt;/a&gt;, which has proven to be successful in treating certain blood cancers.

In fact, it is a staple in processed foods. A cooking oil commonly consumed in the United States could be fuelling the obesity crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; A recent experiment conducted at UC Riverside found that &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022227525001956" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;America’s favourite cooking oil is linked to obesity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.

The researchers also explored the metabolic pathway behind weight gain in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the experiment, the researchers found that most mice on a high-fat diet rich in soybean oil gained significant weight. However, this oil had no impact on genetically engineered mice. Instead, they produced a slightly different form of a liver protein that influences hundreds of genes linked to fat metabolism. This protein also changes how the body processes linoleic acid, a major component of soybean oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; “This may be the first step toward understanding why some people gain weight more easily than others on a diet high in soybean oil,” corresponding author Sonia Deol, a UCR biomedical scientist, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The researchers noted that both versions of the liver protein HNF4α exist in humans; however, the alternative form is produced only under certain conditions, such as chronic illness or metabolic stress from fasting or alcoholic fatty liver. This variation, along with differences in age, sex, medications, and genetics, may help explain why some people gain weight, and others don’t, while consuming soybean oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; This new experiment builds on previous work by UCR researchers &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0132672" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;linking soybean oil to weight gain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. “We’ve known since our 2015 study that soybean oil is more obesogenic than coconut oil. But now we have the clearest evidence yet that it’s not the oil itself, or even linoleic acid. It’s what the fat turns into inside the body,” Frances Sladek, a UCR professor of cell biology, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The linoleic acid in soybean oil is converted into molecules called oxylipins. Excessive consumption leads to increased amounts of oxylipins, which are linked with inflammation and fat accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is soybean oil the villain?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soybean oil is widely consumed in the US. In fact, a 2011 study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that there has been a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523022700?via%3Dihub" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;five-fold increase in soybean oil consumption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in the past century, from about 2% of total calories to nearly 10%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though soybeans are excellent sources of plant-based protein and their oil contains no cholesterol, excessive consumption of linoleic acid may cause more harm than good. As soybean oil is a staple in ultra-processed foods, it may be fuelling chronic metabolic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The researchers also found that despite the lack of cholesterol in soybean oil, its consumption is still associated with higher cholesterol levels in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Soybean oil isn’t inherently evil. But the quantities in which we consume it are triggering pathways our bodies didn’t evolve to handle,” Sladek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; “It took 100 years from the first observed link between chewing tobacco and cancer to get warning labels on cigarettes. We hope it won’t take that long for society to recognise the link between excessive soybean oil consumption and negative health effects,” Sladek added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

	                                &lt;p&gt;Staff from Idaho Fish and Game’s Panhandle Regional Office operated a check station Nov. 16 along Interstate 90 near Fourth of July Pass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the station was to monitor hunter compliance with Idaho’s wildlife laws and to evaluate whether big game harvested out of state or from an Idaho chronic wasting disease management zone was being transported in accordance with CWD regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many other states, Idaho prohibits transporting or importing the spine or brain tissue of deer, elk and moose harvested in states where CWD has been detected. Nearly all of Idaho’s neighboring states — and most states nationwide — are currently CWD-positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the recent check station represents only a brief snapshot in time, Fish and Game staff observed that compliance with CWD-related transport rules was very low. Chronic wasting disease is a fatal neurological disease that poses a significant risk to Idaho’s big game herds, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunters who pursue big game outside Idaho and plan to bring any parts into or through the state are encouraged to review Idaho’s legal transport requirements by visiting the CWD webpage on the Idaho Fish and Game website. Hunters who pursue big game within Idaho’s CWD management zones should also take time to understand the zone-specific rules and requirements before heading into the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Idaho law authorizes Fish and Game to operate check stations to enforce wildlife regulations and collect biological data that supports wildlife management. All hunters, anglers and trappers — with or without game — are required to stop when encountering an official Fish and Game check station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Idaho Department of Fish and Game&lt;/p&gt;

While a slow heartbeat can be normal for athletes, for others it may signal an underlying health problem that needs attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Who should be careful?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A slow heartbeat can happen to anyone; some people need to be particularly cautious. Dr Kumar, "Certain groups are at higher risk, including older adults, individuals with existing heart conditions, diabetes, or kidney disease, and those taking certain medications.” &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;So if you fall into any of the mentioned groups, monitoring your heart rate and consulting a doctor regularly would help to detect bradycardia and prevent complications such as dizziness, fatigue, or fainting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Can it be prevented?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, can this be prevented? &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;As per the cardiologist, not all causes of a slow heartbeat can be avoided, but you can lower your risk by taking care of your heart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added, "&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;While not all causes are preventable, maintaining a heart-healthy lifestyle through regular exercise, a balanced diet, stress management, and routine medical check-ups can significantly reduce your risk and support overall heart health.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 warning signs which indicates that indicate your slow heartbeat could be bradycardia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/06/09/original/dizzyy_1749461325665.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Dizziness is one of the symptoms of bradycardia.(Picture credit: Shutterstock)" title="Dizziness is one of the symptoms of bradycardia.(Picture credit: Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Dizziness is one of the symptoms of bradycardia.(Picture credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Kumar listed these 5 signs which may mean you have bradycardia and require a doctor visit:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistent fatigue and weakness:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Feeling drained, even after rest, can signal that your heart isn't delivering enough oxygen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dizziness or light-headedness:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Insufficient blood flow to the brain due to a slow heart rate can cause these sensations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fainting or near-fainting spells:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; A sudden, significant drop in heart rate can lead to loss of consciousness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shortness of breath, especially during activity:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Your heart struggles to meet oxygen demands, causing breathlessness with minimal exertion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chest pain or discomfort:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; This can indicate your heart muscle isn't receiving enough oxygen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

For many households, freezing bread is simply a practical step to reduce waste during colder months when groceries last longer and consumption patterns shift. Recent discussions among clinicians and nutrition researchers have highlighted that freezing may also influence how the body processes carbohydrates. In a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRkiUK4DRh5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;popular reel, Dr Kunal Sood explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; that freezing alters the structure of starch in ways that change how the digestive system responds to it. This has prompted renewed interest in understanding whether a basic habit like freezing bread can support healthier metabolic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hidden health &lt;keyword id="31113739" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="benefits-of-freezing-bread" source="Orion"&gt;benefits of freezing bread&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Kunal Sood describes the process clearly, saying, “Freezing your bread doesn’t just keep it from going stale, it can actually make it a little healthier. Here’s how. When bread is frozen and then defrosted, some of the starches go through a process called retrogradation. That’s when part of the starch structure reorganises and turns into what’s known as resistant starch.” Resistant starch behaves differently from the rapidly digested starches found in freshly baked bread. In his words, “Resistant starch acts more like fibre than sugar. Your body digests it more slowly, which leads to steadier blood sugar levels and less of a spike after eating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Five Effective Ways to Detoxify Your Gut Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This explanation aligns with findings from a controlled trial &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jpcmed.com/article_178948.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;published in Journal of Preventative and Complementary Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, which examined how freezing and reheating white bread affected the glycaemic response of healthy individuals. The researchers reported that freezing and then defrosting reduced post meal blood glucose spikes by up to 30 percent compared with fresh bread. As Dr Sood states, “One study even found that freezing and then defrosting white bread reduced post meal blood sugar spikes by up to 30 percent, compared to eating it fresh.” These effects offer a foundation for understanding the key benefits, which include better digestion and metabolic balance, antioxidant protection and immunity support, a more stable blood sugar response, improved gut microbiome function and higher natural energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The key health effects linked to freezing bread:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supports digestion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Boosts immunity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stabilizes blood sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improves &lt;keyword id="2049757" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="gut-health" source="Orion"&gt;gut health&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supports better daily energy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Better digestion and metabolic balance through resistant starch formation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When bread is exposed to freezing temperatures, the starch molecules gradually reorganise into a form that the body breaks down more slowly. This change means the digestive tract expends less effort managing sudden glucose surges, which often strain metabolic pathways during colder seasons when heavier meals are common. The presence of resistant starch encourages a steadier digestive rhythm, allowing nutrients to be absorbed at a smoother pace. Many individuals find that foods containing resistant starch contribute to prolonged satiety and more consistent digestive comfort, particularly when eaten during winter months when fluctuations in eating patterns tend to be more pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Antioxidant protection and immunity boost influenced by slower digestion&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slower carbohydrate digestion affects how antioxidants and micronutrients are released and absorbed. Winter diets often rely on preserved, reheated or starchy foods, which sometimes offer limited micronutrient density. Bread that has undergone freezing and retrogradation releases its sugars at a slower rate, which helps maintain more balanced cellular activity. This supports the immune system indirectly, because stable metabolic conditions improve the body’s capacity to regulate inflammation and oxidative stress. Although bread is not a primary antioxidant source, its altered digestibility helps regulate processes that protect immune cells from excessive metabolic strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. More stable blood sugar response supported by clinical findings&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A central benefit, articulated by both Dr Sood and the referenced study, is the measurable reduction in post meal blood glucose spikes. The shift toward resistant starch means the carbohydrate behaves more like dietary fibre, resulting in a gradual rise in glucose rather than a rapid surge. This is particularly relevant in winter, when many people rely on toast or warm sandwiches as quick energy sources. A gentler glycaemic response helps support concentration, appetite control and overall metabolic stability throughout the day. As Dr Sood adds, “If you toast it after freezing, the effect becomes even stronger,” suggesting that reheating may amplify this stabilising influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Improved gut microbiome function through increased resistant starch intake&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistant starch plays a recognised role in feeding beneficial gut bacteria, which rely on fermentable fibres to produce short chain fatty acids. These compounds support colon health, enhance nutrient absorption and contribute to balanced immune responses. Dr Sood highlights this when he says, “That slower digestion helps not just for glucose control but also supports gut health since resistant starch feeds the beneficial bacteria in your colon.” During winter, when digestive sluggishness and irregular meal timing are common, foods that nourish the microbiome can help maintain smoother digestive behaviour and improve overall wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Higher natural energy levels linked to steadier carbohydrate release&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy fluctuations in cold weather often reflect inconsistent glucose patterns influenced by refined carbohydrates. Freezing bread adjusts the structure of its starch in a way that creates a more gradual energy supply. Instead of a quick burst followed by fatigue, the body receives a sustained release that supports alertness and endurance throughout daily activities.

The use of multi-state modeling is robust, with transitions aligning well with other cohort studies. However, there are some limitations to consider, such as reliance on opportunistic testing, potential selection bias, and limited generalizability due to the specific population studied. This study was only in a small area of India with its own culture and food preferences, making its less generalizable to many other people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a few people are diagnosed following symptoms that may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;increased appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;unexplained weight loss/weight gain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;high body mass index (BMI)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;weakness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;sweating&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;blurred vision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;slow healing cuts or bruises&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;recurrent skin infections/gum bleeding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because prediabetes is usually symptom-free, Ogden advised that “it’s crucial to focus on risk factors like being overweight, having a family history of diabetes, or conditions such as &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/150109" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Testing is generally recommended from the age of 35, or earlier for individuals with these risk factors. For higher-risk populations, such as South Asians, earlier testing from around age 25 may be appropriate,” he told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most, the condition will be detected by a blood glucose test — the &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549816/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;hemoglobin A1c, or HbA1c test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;. This simple blood test shows average blood glucose levels over the preceding 3 months, with the results given as a percentage, as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;normal blood sugar — below 5.7%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;prediabetes — between 5.7 and 6.4%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;type 2 diabetes — above 6.4%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes is far more common in people who have had prediabetes than in those who have normal blood glucose levels, so lifestyle changes that reverse prediabetes are key to preventing it progressing to the more serious condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Preventing progression to type 2 diabetes requires prompt lifestyle modifications. Aiming for 5-10% weight loss, engaging in at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week, and focusing on a diet rich in whole grains, vegetables, and lean proteins can be impactful. Addressing lifestyle factors such as sleep quality, stress management, and smoking cessation is also vital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Jack Ogden, MBChB, BSc, LLM, IBLM, MRCGP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10420389/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that several lifestyle interventions are effective in reversing prediabetes in adults.

Long-term follow-up demonstrated that the lifestyle intervention continued to delay onset of diabetes and reduced long-term incidence over 10 to 15 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“These findings powerfully affirm that through intentional, consistent choices around nutrition, physical activity, and weight management, many people with prediabetes can significantly delay progression to type 2 diabetes,” said Eichorst.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The longer a person has had prediabetes, the harder it is to reverse it, so Ogden advised that taking steps as soon as prediabetes is diagnosed is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The study emphasizes the importance of timely action, particularly within the first 2-3 years of a prediabetes diagnosis, as this period is the most effective window for reversal,” he pointed out.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also underscores that, despite healthcare accessibility, approximately 30% of individuals with prediabetes progress to diabetes within a decade, whereas up to 60% revert in the early stages. This highlights the potential for targeted, early interventions to yield significant benefits,” added Ogden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 06:22:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPUjhCdjVlTmtKVTcyWFF1OGN1d21HQW1RMW9BdFMxUXZZN3VBOWRuaGRfWXdOQzhXZHVoZ19qMHlpTld3eGpnYzlYNmtCSTczTUlUSnhCZlZoNW9LR3FBTVdodkJNaVQxS0NxaWllTGlHY0lXUzRtY2w3LVU3VFFYeVVKV0paNDhkQkozeGlYakgxZUxnTUc3amhBVTI4OXVZcFdhRlVzcw</guid></item><item><title>本地和地区艾滋病毒感染病例呈上升趋势- Stabroek News</title><link>https://www.stabroeknews.com/2025/11/29/news/guyana/hiv-cases-locally-regionally-on-the-rise/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="post-825113" class="post-825113 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail category-guyana tag-featured"&gt;&lt;div class="article-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-Health Minister urges persons to get tested&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="in-content-ad"&gt;

In the past year here in Guyana, we would have diagnosed at least 449 new infections,” Dr. Anthony said as the Ministry of Health yesterday launched planned activities for the month of December with World AIDS Day globally recognised on December 1.  The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) can result in Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="in-content-ad mbo"&gt;

A messy kid area in their car is inevitable — they're dealing with their kids' needs and, in some ways, their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice these things in someone's car, chances are they're not only a burnt out parent, but a stressed out person who regularly overlooks their own self-care to take care of everyone else around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/people-who-consider-their-car-family-member-usually-have-these-reasons"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People Who Consider Their Car A Family Member Usually Have These 8 Reasons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zaydaslabbekoorn/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zayda Slabbekoorn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a senior editorial strategist with a bachelor's degree in social relations &amp;amp; policy and gender studies who focuses on psychology, relationships, self-help, and human interest stories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="midcat-most-popular"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Related Stories From YourTango:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="rc-widget-c743d1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>YourTango</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 04:32:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPdkNuUlA4UDlDZHozRHFxOTVJZzdEYXEyR0UyYm1NaU5idHN4ZEFTQTlIYUZNcWVMSFI2VzJIbzZmeWVmdVkyQ0pDdEI3NG1fTHh2emRVQmhKUzVOUERWN3BiMkxIa21YVUgtbkVzZ3ptU19GdUc1NzA4eXlualZzaTRjMjhnOVhSNHIweUw4LUJQXzY5aE9SZE5PaG9DVUE</guid></item><item><title>人工智能终于揭开了有百年历史的癌症之谜- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/ai-finally-takes-on-a-century-old-cancer-mystery/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 03:26:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFB5cnBrLU1Fa1JWM2pWZ0tVdHBOVDZIYUNjSGZJc1dJdDdOUGI4SldBNUM0dUhEZHpKbVZSOEtvQ0F6Um5PX3ZCQzAzTnRQdF9ydEhRbml0aGlXOWZFYVYzb0pJVnpnX3Z3VGpuOHJMekI5UFZjaHJMd05xWnFJUzQ</guid></item><item><title>FDA将10例儿童死亡归因于新冠疫苗-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/28/health/fda-children-deaths-covid-vaccines.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 03:26:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOb1dSWF9BOUxNM09BWENZZDlUeVRXSkZ0aGlVSjhsYURfYTQ3OHdaU19HVkJodnNrT2dfNVJYRUwxSVEtdWJvQlJKN0J6T2VDQ1FLZnYxRFhFODc3OW1oVmVrdTRhSXRwUzRYNzBHS2hnUnJQRUVLLURlRlhGRkNydF9fT3A5TU1z</guid></item><item><title>“我不应该为流产感到内疚” - BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7v89prnmeo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;'I shouldn't have felt guilty for my miscarriages'&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gtLOOD"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e2b4/live/d11a71c0-c877-11f0-b59b-8f3754d4238d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e2b4/live/d11a71c0-c877-11f0-b59b-8f3754d4238d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e2b4/live/d11a71c0-c877-11f0-b59b-8f3754d4238d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e2b4/live/d11a71c0-c877-11f0-b59b-8f3754d4238d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e2b4/live/d11a71c0-c877-11f0-b59b-8f3754d4238d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e2b4/live/d11a71c0-c877-11f0-b59b-8f3754d4238d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e2b4/live/d11a71c0-c877-11f0-b59b-8f3754d4238d.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e2b4/live/d11a71c0-c877-11f0-b59b-8f3754d4238d.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC A woman with grey hair is standing outside.

loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She said many women do not share their pregnancy news before the 12-week scan, so if they miscarry earlier, they can struggle to know who to talk to which can be isolating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Miscarriage often has no identifiable cause, which Dr Aventin said can prompt women to blame themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She added women may accept one miscarriage as bad luck, but when it happens again they frequently start to wonder if they are somehow at fault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Is there something I'm doing wrong here, did I have a glass of wine before I knew I was pregnant, am I exercising wrong?," Dr Aventin said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"These types of things, women tend to blame themselves for and that brings an aspect of guilt."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Dr Áine Aventin said the lack of knowledge around what causes miscarriages can lead women to blame

amazing midwives, bereavement nurses and healthcare practitioners, but that services are overstretched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She said more resources are needed, both to educate healthcare professionals on how to support women after miscarriage and give them the time to provide that support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"When women have this experience, they're really vulnerable," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"They need sensitive communication, compassion that somebody understands what they're going through is a significant loss for them, even if there isn't a visible baby."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Aventin gave an example of the compassionate care she received after she had a stillbirth when a nurse saved the petals from the roses a friend had sent her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"With tears in my eyes, I said it to the midwife 'I forgot to water the roses'," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;As she was leaving the nurse gave her a box with the white rose petals inside and said she could put them on her stillborn son's grave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"In the grand scheme of things, a bunch of dead roses was nothing, but this woman understood that, to me, they were Malachy's

class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way every external body part requires cleaning to keep it nourished and healthy, so do internal organs. And one such organ that requires regular cleaning is the liver. After all, it plays a crucial role and acts as the body’s natural detoxifier, filtering out toxins from the blood, breaking down harmful substances, and metabolizing drugs and alcohol. The liver also plays a crucial role in digestion by producing bile, which helps break down fats and absorb nutrients. But sadly, the erratic lifestyle habits have placed the liver health at risk. Dr. Shubham Vatsya, a gastroenterologist and hepatologist at Fortis Vasant Kunj recently shared a reel on Instagram and mentioned that our liver heals silently, if you give it the right support. As per him, small, daily habits can genuinely reduce inflammation, improve fat metabolism, and protect the liver from long-term damage. He adds that adding the right morning and evening drinks can make a measurable difference in just a few weeks.
