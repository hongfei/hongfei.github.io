    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An estimated 75 to 85 percent of Americans experience back pain at some point during their lifetimes, while 25million currently suffer from lower back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors normally treat the pain, which can be caused by sprains, arthritis and traumatic injuries, with over-the-counter painkillers, physical therapy and, in some cases, surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients have also been offered talk therapy since 2017, with doctors referring some patients for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With CBT, patients attempt to reconceptualize their pain in order to reduce it. Pain reductions from this tend to be short-lived, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the new study, scientists recruited patients who had been suffering from moderate back pain who said it limited their day-to-day activities, such as causing them to move slowly or struggle to pick up heavy objects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were 47 years old on average, overweight and said they had been seeking care for the pain for four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were asked to attend 20 clinics in Perth and Sydney, Australia, to receive treatment between October 2018 and August 2020 and split into three groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first received CFT, the second received CFT plus biofeedback, where sensors are used to map movements, and the third received typical care, or followed the care plan recommended by their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in both CFT groups attended seven treatment sessions over three months and a booster session at six months. Each session lasted 60 minutes and was led by a physical therapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the percentage of adults aged 18 and over with any form of pain. Back pain is the most common form of pain in the US, the figures suggest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the CFT sessions, participants were first encouraged to share the story of their pain to help them understand their discomfort and its underlying causes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were then guided through movements and activities that they previously said were painful, feared or avoided, to help them learn how to manage the pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of the sessions, patients also received lifestyle guidance on healthy habits such as the need for regular physical activity, improved sleep, diet and regular socializing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the initial study, published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00441-5/abstract"&gt;The Lancet Rheumatology&lt;/a&gt;, all participants had a moderate level of disability from back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three years later, however, in the groups that received CFT this had dropped to and remained at a mild level of disability, when back pain causes some limitations but does not impair overall function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with mild impairment may be able to walk around with little difficulty but can still struggle to lift heavy objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There was no significant difference between the groups that received CFT only and those that received CFT and biofeedback. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the group continuing typical care, however, people still experienced a moderate level of disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Participants who received CFT still reported significant improvements in pain three years later (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A moderate level of disability suggests participants can move only a short distance before requiring a break and can still perform basic daily activities like dressing or cooking but may take longer than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was first revealed in 2023 but was republished again this month with updated data from three years after the study began, showing that the therapy could reduce pain for three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists said CFT boosted participants' movement and reduced their pain because it reduced their fear of certain actions that had caused pain and made them less likely to avoid these behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said the course was also carried out by trained therapists and had a booster session six months later, which ensured patients got better training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the latest paper, the researchers said: 'CFT produces clinically important effects for activity limitation at three-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These long-term effects are novel and provide the opportunity to markedly reduce the effect of chronic back pain if the intervention can be widely implemented.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 04:58:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>靶向单一激素可以帮助治疗40%的IBS-D病例- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPMTRhQk5mQTR3ZXdON01obVVQOHBpRnRmanVTcFZPX2FWZjQ1cTFZRmFxUzRqZmhWb1ZIVmlmaS1MaEZMN1FHTGlqeHNScWZ4ZW8xV3FiM1EzUHl5Vm9UM3JuTWE3aUlBcjktTmVLTjNuVkF0cjVsQkx3N0NadzN0MllLSTVzUHdJNzVmcmF2QUY4WnV2?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) is an unpleasant condition to live with, affecting &lt;a href="https://gutscharity.org.uk/advice-and-information/conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome/"&gt;millions of people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. Now a new study has identified what could be a key trigger for the condition – a trigger which could be targeted by future treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investigation on 108 people with and without IBS-D and related conditions has revealed a hormone called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INSL5"&gt;insulin-like peptide 5&lt;/a&gt; (INSL5) is released when bile acids that aid digestion find themselves further along the digestive tract than usual, in the large intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shouldn't happen, but when it does – due to certain conditions and gut malfunctions – more INSL5 gets produced, which causes diarrhea-like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is potentially responsible for around two out of every five cases of IBS-D, the researchers say, and may explain why a lot of existing drugs and strategies to combat IBS-D are ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprising-nocebo-effect-shows-gluten-may-not-be-the-problem-in-ibs"&gt;Surprising 'Nocebo Effect' Shows Gluten May Not Be The Problem in IBS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you go to the doctor with chronic diarrhea, they'll likely test for food intolerances, rule out an infection or look for signs of inflammation," &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/discovery-of-role-of-gut-hormone-in-chronic-diarrhoea-could-aid-development-of-new-tests-and"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Chris Bannon, an endocrinologist at the University of Cambridge in the UK. "There has been significant research interest in the microbiome, but gut hormones have been neglected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's becoming increasingly clear that gut hormones play an important role in things like gut health and weight management."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170814" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170814" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BileChart.jpg" alt="INSL5 levels chart" class="wp-image-170814 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BileChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BileChart-600x269.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170814" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers found bile acids (TCA) led to elevated ISNL5 levels and diarrhea. (Bannon et al., &lt;em&gt;Gut&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included participants with &lt;a href="https://patient.info/digestive-health/irritable-bowel-syndrome-leaflet/bile-acid-diarrhoea"&gt;bile acid diarrhea&lt;/a&gt; (BAD) as well as IBS-D, helping the researchers identify a link between these conditions, the differences between them, and the triggers responsible for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, BAD is difficult to diagnose and is often classed as IBS, and the researchers hope that being better able to spot it will lead to treatments that can more effectively target the underlying causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to note that INSL5 is naturally produced by the body. Although it &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/severe-diarrhea-cases-surging-across-uk-and-scientists-dont-know-why"&gt;brings on diarrhea&lt;/a&gt;, it's actually a sign of the body trying to protect itself: it detects that bile acids shouldn't be in the colon, and flushes them out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It makes sense that you would have something that detects toxins and helps the body rid itself of them," &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/discovery-of-role-of-gut-hormone-in-chronic-diarrhoea-could-aid-development-of-new-tests-and"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bannon. "But a problem develops if it's always being triggered by bile acid, causing very dramatic symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies using mouse models &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-022-03635-8"&gt;had found&lt;/a&gt; that INSL5 could cause diarrhea, but this is the first time researchers have been able to show the same processes in people, and in ways that are connected to two recognized conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next steps are to look at potential treatments targeting INSL5. Some IBS-D patients in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/apt.17426"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; showed improved symptoms when given the anti-sickness medicine ondansetron – a known INSL5 blocker – which may indicate one route forward, although it's not yet clear why ondansetron works so well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was a very exciting finding because it showed us that this hormone could be playing a big part in symptoms of this misunderstood condition," &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/discovery-of-role-of-gut-hormone-in-chronic-diarrhoea-could-aid-development-of-new-tests-and"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bannon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It also meant it might allow us to develop a blood test to help diagnose bile acid diarrhea if INSL5 levels are only high in these individuals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2025-335393"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Lifelong boat captain George Billiris says he's lucky to be alive after &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/florida-vibrio-vulnificus-cases-2025-deaths-decline-danger-remains/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Vibrio vulnificus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the so-called "flesh-eating" bacteria that lurks in warm coastal waters like those along Florida's Gulf Coast, nearly killed him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I started to get chills, feverish, my leg was swelling, burning," the third-generation sponge fisherman told CBS News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billiris was wading in the water while fishing with his grandson back in July 2019 when he contracted the bacteria, which got into his system through a cut he had on his back leg. It was "just a little tiny scab," Billiris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the hospital, doctors used a marker on his leg to track the spread of the bacteria. After three weeks of treatment, the infection subsided, saving his leg from amputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flesh-eating-bacteria-vibrio-vulnificus-how-to-protect-yourself-expert/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;one in five people who contract the bacteria die&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; after rapid spread of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-names-list-2025-season/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;hurricane season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the danger of contracting Vibrio vulnificus heightens, according to Dr. Valerie Harwood, a microbiologist at the University of South Florida.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Research also shows the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ocean-temperatures-higher-models-predicted-climate-experts-warn/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;ocean's water temperature is rising&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; due to climate change, which leads to more frequent and severe storms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harwood said that because the bacteria thrives in warmer waters, it means more infections are seen in places that haven't experienced them before as water temperatures rise in those regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With warming waters, we are seeing cases further north," Harwood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, cases have been reported in the Carolinas, and even as far north as Connecticut and New York. This year, there have been 17 cases in Louisiana, 16 in Florida and seven in North Carolina. Florida has reported five deaths so far, the most of any state.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bacteria can also spread through uncooked seafood, mainly oysters.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, Billiris says he is more cautious in the water, but he still sails his family's boat nearly every day. He hopes others will recognize the symptoms of an infection, because earlier treatment could mean the difference between life and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lot of people waited because they didn't know," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

                                    &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health has confirmed another case of travel-related dengue on Oahu, bringing the total in the state to 12 so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest case comes about a week after the &lt;a href="https://808ne.ws/45NmT1J" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;11th reported case&lt;/a&gt; of dengue, which was also on Oahu. A 10th case was reported on Aug. 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The affected individual in this current case was exposed to the virus while traveling in a region where dengue is common,” DOH said, “and is not connected to prior cases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said teams have gone to the affected area for inspections and to implement mosquito control measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/dengue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dengue&lt;/a&gt; is a viral illness spread through mosquito bites. While Hawaii is home to Aedes mosquitoes, which can carry dengue, the disease is not endemic in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dengue outbreaks are reported frequently in the Caribbean, Central America, South America, Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands declared dengue outbreaks in 2024 that have continued into 2025. American Samoa, meanwhile, declared a &lt;a href="https://www.americansamoa.gov/_files/ugd/4bfff9_6bafc078fa49425b82c637ad978046de.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;public health emergency&lt;/a&gt; due to a dengue outbreak in early July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public is encouraged to review country-specific guidance on dengue risk and prevention measures at least four to six weeks before traveling. Upon returning from dengue-endemic areas, residents should try to prevent mosquito bites for three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If dengue symptoms — such as fever, nausea, vomiting, rash and body aches — develop within two weeks of return from dengue-affected areas, residents should see their health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, there have been 11 travel-related cases confirmed on Oahu, and one on Maui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7959854/ways-to-add-5-grams-of-fiber-to-your-meals/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;consuming at least 50% of your grains&lt;/a&gt; from whole grains sources.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Whole grains contain the entire bran layer of the grain kernel, meaning they pack more fiber and other nutrients that other refined grains lack. In fact, dietitian &lt;a href="https://roxanaehsani.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Roxana Ehsani, MS, RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;, shares, “One serving of popcorn provides &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7898414/what-are-whole-grains/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;one-third of your daily whole grain needs&lt;/a&gt;, and 4 grams of dietary fiber.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Wong points out &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7910393/new-study-whole-grains-waist-size-blood-pressure-blood-sugar/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;eating more whole grains&lt;/a&gt; routinely helps nourish your microbiome, "contributing to more predictable bowel movements.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Popcorn contains &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-as-many-antioxidants-as-green-tea-11761365" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;compounds known as polyphenols&lt;/a&gt;, which have &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2051586/best-antioxidant-rich-foods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;antioxidant properties&lt;/a&gt;. Antioxidants help protect cells from damage caused by free radicals–the “bad guys” that may cause harm to our health in the long run. Research has explored the health benefits of popcorn throughout the decades, concluding it has a positive influence on gut health thanks to its polyphenol activity specifically.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Ehsani shares, “Popcorn’s polyphenols can help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/does-inflammation-harm-your-gut-health-8715529" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;reduce inflammation in the gut&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-better-gut-health-11681954" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;support the growth of healthy gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Better gut health is possible, but it involves taking a close look at both diet and lifestyle.  Wong shares, “Bowel health isn’t just about eating more fiber — it’s about the whole picture. Managing stress, getting enough sleep, and listening to your body’s natural cues are just as important as what’s on your plate.” Consider these dietitian-recommended tips for better digestion too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move Your Body:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular exercise is essential for better bowel health. Wong and Ehsani recommend consistent daily movement in whatever form feels enjoyable. Pick your favorite–a short walk, resistance exercise, or a swim all count. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Hydrated&lt;/strong&gt;: Drinking water throughout your day helps prevent dehydration, a common culprit in struggling to go number 2. Carry a large reusable water and make a goal to refill it with every mealtime, ensuring you're constantly drinking throughout your day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat probiotic rich foods:&lt;/strong&gt; Probiotics help nourish a healthy gut and aid digestion, helping to keep your bowel movements regular. Consider adding more probiotic rich foods into your diet, like kefir, yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi, or kombucha.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow down.&lt;/strong&gt; Being mindful as you eat is important, notes Braddock, as quickly consuming large volumes of food can disrupt your digestion. Consider taking some deep breaths before eating to help calm your nervous system and prepare to properly digest. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And yes, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11775341" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eat more fiber&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Braddock recommends eating more high-fiber fruits and veggies routinely to find relief. She writes, “Raspberries are one of the highest fiber fruits per serving. Plus, eating two kiwis a day can help improve constipation and abdominal discomfort.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Smart foods swaps can help improve your gut health—in turn offering relief from constipation that may be weighing you down. While fruits and vegetables are natural choices to swap in for other less nutritious choices, they don’t always satisfy you the same way. That’s why nutrition experts recommend starting small with easy swaps that may be more satisfying, like trying &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-make-popcorn-in-the-microwave-8721280" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;air-popped popcorn in lieu of potato chips&lt;/a&gt; to get that same crunch with more fiber and antioxidants. Fiber is a key component to helping you poop, and every gram counts!

While the growths may look disturbing, officials stressed they do not pose a threat to humans, pets, or other wildlife.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The virus only spreads between rabbits, typically through bites from insects such as mosquitoes and ticks. According to the University of Missouri, the condition is a DNA virus ‘seen most frequently in cottontail rabbits of the Midwest with outbreaks in domestic rabbits’. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Local Sightings and reactions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fort Collins residents have reported multiple sightings, including one rabbit that returned to a homeowner’s yard for two consecutive years with increasingly severe growths.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some residents initially feared the animals had plague or another dangerous illness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Descriptions of the appearance range from ‘black quills’ to a ‘scabby growth’ covering parts of the face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I thought he would die off during the winter, but he didn’t,” a local, Susan Mansfield, told NBC local affiliate KUSA.“He came back a second year, and it grew.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What is Shope Papilloma Virus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus causes benign wart-like tumors, but in some cases, these can become malignant (cancerous). While generally not harmful to the rabbit’s overall health, tumors can create problems if they obstruct the mouth, nose, or eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The disease is relatively common in wild rabbit populations, particularly during warmer months when insect activity is high.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no known cure for the virus; surgical removal of tumors is sometimes performed for domestic rabbits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colorado Parks and Wildlife is advising residents to keep their distance. The rabbits are not dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 23:01:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>步行技巧的微小变化如何帮助治疗膝关节骨性关节炎- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxPNDBibmVoZDFYQlZCZ3QwWlBmTDV6Z2ItTk5CS3VISFZWTTB4cGlTUUdkWGZFaW93WVZlWmRyOV9FQXJZd2UtNWJwQjFQcVBuM1lDekJmZnFHV0x1aEozNGd6b3FXWlhhSXZPWExwTXhrYy05SnVaSkZHQVZzWVVYVDU3a1UwQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gait analysis and pain measures show that subtly adjusting the angle of the foot during walking may reduce knee pain caused by osteoarthritis. This approach may also slow progression of the condition, an incurable disease in which the cartilage cushion inside a joint breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Led by a team of researchers at NYU Langone Health, the University of Utah, and Stanford University, a new study explored whether changing the way patients position their feet when walking could lessen extra loading—stress on the joint during motion—and help treat the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the investigation, the scientists tested this intervention in 68 men and women with mild to moderate &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/knee+osteoarthritis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;knee osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt; and then used advanced MRI scans to track how well it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that those trained to angle their feet slightly inward or outward from their natural alignment experienced slower cartilage degeneration in the inner part of their knee compared with those who were encouraged to walk more frequently without changing their foot position. A report on the study is published online in the journal &lt;i&gt;The Lancet Rheumatology.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although our results will have to be confirmed in future studies, they raise the possibility that the new, noninvasive treatment could help delay surgery," said study co-lead author Valentina Mazzoli, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mazzoli, an assistant professor in the Department of Radiology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, notes that the earlier patients receive a knee replacement, the more likely they are to require additional procedures in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings also revealed that those who adjusted their foot angle reduced their pain score by 2.5 points on a 10-point scale, an effect equivalent to that of over-the-counter pain medications. By contrast, those who did not change their gait reduced their pain scores by little more than a point.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"Altogether, our findings suggest that helping patients find their best foot angle to reduce stress on their knees may offer an easy and fairly inexpensive way to address early-stage osteoarthritis," added Mazzoli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one in seven Americans have some form of osteoarthritis, commonly in the inner side of the knee, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A leading cause of disability, the disease is often managed with pharmaceutical pain relievers, physical therapy, and, in the most severe cases, knee-replacement surgery. Experts believe that excess loading can over time contribute to the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past research has offered little evidence that changes in gait can effectively reduce &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/knee+pain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;knee pain&lt;/a&gt; caused by osteoarthritis, says Mazzoli. Some previous trials trained all participants to adopt the same foot angle and found no relief, while others did not compare the intervention to a control group or only followed the participants for a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study is the first to show that tailoring each patient's foot angle to their unique walking pattern can alleviate the disease's symptoms in the long term and may slow cartilage breakdown, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mazzoli adds that this technique may have a significant advantage over pharmaceutical painkillers. These drugs, she says, do not address the underlying disease and can cause liver and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/kidney+damage/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;kidney damage&lt;/a&gt;, stomach ulcers, and other unwanted side effects when taken for long periods.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;For the study, the research team recorded the participants walking on a treadmill at a specialized gait-assessment laboratory. A computer program simulated their walking patterns and calculated the maximum loading that occurred in the inner side of their knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the team generated computer models of four new foot positions—angled inward or outward by either 5 degrees or 10 degrees—and estimated which option reduced loading the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patients were then randomly divided into two groups. Half were trained in six sessions to walk at their ideal angle while the other half were instructed to continue walking naturally. Pain scores and MRI scans were taken at the beginning of the study period and one year after the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Study findings showed those who adjusted their gait reduced the maximum loading in the knees by 4%, while those who kept their normal walking pattern increased their loading by more than 3%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results highlight the importance of personalizing treatment instead of taking a one-size-fits-all approach to osteoarthritis," said Mazzoli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While this strategy may sound challenging, recent advances in detecting the motion of different body parts using &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/artificial+intelligence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; may make it easier and faster than ever before."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the authors relied on a specialized laboratory for the new study, artificial intelligence software that estimates joint loading using smartphone videos is now available and can allow clinicians to perform a gait analysis in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers next plan to test whether these tools can indeed identify the most effective walking method for osteoarthritis patients, says Mazzoli. They also plan to expand their study to people with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

This includes salt water and brackish water, which is a mixture of salt and freshwater often found where rivers meet the ocean. The bacteria are found particularly along the Gulf Coast states like Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Alabama and Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are different kinds of Vibrio that can lead to various infections. Vibrio vulnificus can be particularly dangerous because it can cause severe and life-threatening infections. This specific type of bacteria is known as “flesh-eating” because it can destroy muscle tissue and skin. “Many people with [Vibrio] vulnificus wound infection require intensive care or surgical tissue removal,” &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00497.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the CDC says;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the CDC says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-do-people-get-infected"&gt;How do people get infected?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are two ways that people can get infected:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-decimal"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When a person’s open wound is exposed to ocean water or seafood contaminated with Vibrio bacteria.

People love to say you should slow down, take it easy, and swallow the bitter pill of mortality without a lot of fuss. And by people, I mean the wellness-industrial complex and their cadre of barely postpubescent personal trainers who lower the weights if you tell them you’re over 30. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They mean well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, at Tone House gym in New York City, Mickey Crawford, a 61-year-old substance abuse counselor, is dragging a 115-pound weighted sled across the floor while his coach, Alonzo, secretly covertly sandbags. Afroditi Lishman, a 52-year-old New Yorker, is sprinting and bear crawling her way past 20- and 30-somethings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And this is just the warm up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;(L-R) Afroditi Lishman and Crawford lifting weights and doing arm and leg exercises on the bar at Tone House. &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Illustration: HuffPost; Photo by Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tone House, a sports-performance studio in New York’s NoMad district, is infamous for its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/tone-house-workout-review-48451288" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brutal conditioning workouts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;brutal conditioning workouts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Think pro football training meets bootcamp with a “You can do it!” ethos. Founder Alonzo Wilson built it to make elite training accessible. It’s become a kind of accidental laboratory for debunking bullshit ideas about aging and what older people can do, physically and mentally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because here’s the real story: Aging isn’t about decline. Or at least, it’s not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;just&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; about decline — not unless you’re actively neglecting your mind and body. Or, you know, actively being neglected by a medical and cultural system that treats older adults like they’re doddering and breakable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;“It’s my therapy,” Lishman says. “Training is a great booster to one’s confidence, mentally. That’s one of the main reasons why I work out.” &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s ageism,” says Teresa Liu-Ambrose, a physical therapy professor and Canada Research Chair in healthy eating at the University of British Columbia, when I ask her about the idea that people over a certain age should only do easy workouts. “And a misconception,” she adds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Liu-Ambrose should know. She’s been studying aging for decades. Her &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oMkpWbdL7fBZWiALnEebW8O28x9MykYhS7faO9FJUwo/edit?tab=t.0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Brain Power Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brain Power Study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, published by the Archives of Internal Medicine journal in 2010, found that older women who lifted weights once or twice a week for a year improved their executive function. Even seniors showing early signs of cognitive decline saw better outcomes from resistance training than those who didn’t lift.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In other words, lifting weights helps your brain. And this, in turn, is crucial for overcoming the mental hurdle that rewriting the cultural script about aging and exercise requires.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Crawford, for example, spends his work days helping people. “All day long, I listen to other people’s problems and try to help them out,” says Crawford. “The gym is my outlet. Training helps me do my job. I’m a lot calmer, I’m a lot more empathetic.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lishman agrees. “It’s my therapy,” she says. “Training is a great booster to one’s confidence, mentally. That’s one of the main reasons why I work out.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mental clarity Lishman and Crawford are finding isn’t anecdotal. Liu-Ambrose has seen it in fMRI scans and cognitive tests. “After targeted exercise training, you can see actual... changes in brain function and also an increase in volume,” she says. That’s right. Lifting weights doesn’t just make your muscles bigger, it makes your brain healthier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Crawford and Lishman performing agility drills. &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So if you’re worried about cognitive decline, working out is a no brainer. Most of us want to maintain the health of our bodies and brains as we get older, but we’ve also sort of collectively accepted the idea that we will all get weaker as we age. What if that’s not universally true?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Crawford, for example, says that he is now capable of things he wasn’t when he was “in his prime.” These days, he runs three miles after work. “Once upon a time, you couldn’t get me to run one mile,” he tells me. Twenty years ago, Mickey hated running. He tried cross country in high school and detested it. “Now,” he says, laughing, “I somewhat enjoy it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;On the left, Crawford performs weighted walking lunges, and on the right, Tone House Founder Alonzo Wilson coaches Crawford on a barbell back squat. &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point is not that Crawford learned to love something he used to hate, it’s that he learned to do things that improve his health even if they aren’t his favorite activities. And not just in a perfunctory way, either. Crawford is considering running the New York Marathon in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Lishman says her ideas about what it means to get stronger have changed, too. “I’ve gained a new mindset,” she says. “Real growth comes from being uncomfortable — and still pushing forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no one’s being reckless. In fact, the smartest people in the room at Tone House, the 50+ crowd, have an especially nuanced sense of limits. “I know when to push and when to stop and when to recover,” Lishman tells me. “I push myself, but I know when it’s time to take a step back and not try to compete with anyone but myself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Lishman says her ideas about what it means to get stronger have changed, too: “I’ve gained a new mindset.” &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That hard earned wisdom is one of the beautiful ways that aging can make you more adaptive when it comes to training. And it’s exactly what Liu-Ambrose calls “smart progression,” training hard, but with purpose and adaptation. “Too quickly, too hard, and thinking that more is better is what gets people hurt,” she says. “Instead, you reassess every few weeks. If it’s easy, you increase the load. Your body responds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What most people, of any age, fear about intense workouts is getting injured. No one here is naive about the reality of injury. Lishman, for example, trains with two torn menisci and a labrum tear. “I have many injuries,” she says. “But I know how to work around them.” A few days after a tough deadlift session, she noticed her right side, where she has scoliosis, felt tight. So she took a day off. Ten years ago, she says there’s no way she would have missed a workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of responsiveness — not pushing through pain, but also not shrinking from challenge — allows Lishman to keep training. “Closer to your 50s, you realize you don’t need to do eight workouts a week,” she says. “You just need to focus and go with a purpose. Do the one that challenges you, and then step back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Getting stronger after 50 isn’t a miracle. It’s a practice. And, as Crawford says, “If you think you can’t do it, you can’t do it. If you think you can do it, you can.” &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This isn’t just good judgment. It’s the foundation of long-term strength. Liu-Ambrose has seen it play out again and again in her research. In one of her early studies, she tells me, she worked with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15086643/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:older women who already had osteoporosis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;older women who already had osteoporosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; or osteopenia — conditions that compromise bone health. In case you aren’t aware, bone density issues disproportionately affect older women. Women have lower bone density than men to begin with, and bone loss speeds up with the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/menopause-and-bone-loss" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hormonal shifts that come with menopause;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;hormonal shifts that come with menopause&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Through carefully designed, progressive resistance training, the women who participated in Liu-Ambrose’s study didn’t just preserve function ― they improved it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We had participants tell us that they hadn’t been able to take a bath for years,” she says. They were simply not strong enough to get down into the tub and back out again. “We saw a lot of transformation,” says Liu-Ambrose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That kind of transformation is mental and physical, but it’s also social. “It’s not just Tone House the workout, it’s Tone House the community,” says Crawford. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lishman agrees. “I’m going to five different weddings this year, and they’re all Tone House people,” she says. Through fitness, Crawford and Lishman have found belonging across age, ability, and even generation. “My 20-year-old son goes, ‘It’s a family affair,’” Afroditi says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That sense of family and community matters. “Socializing, in itself, is a cognitive task,” Liu-Ambrose says. “Exercise is good, but when you add social interactions to it, it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9053316/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:magnifies the benefits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;span&gt;magnifies the benefits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;“Closer to your 50s, you realize you don’t need to do eight workouts a week,” Lishman says. “You just need to focus and go with a purpose. Do the one that challenges you, and then step back.” &lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And community is what will motivate you and keep you coming back, even if you’re pushing into over the hill territory. “You are never too old to start,” Afroditi says. “Start where you are, meet your body where it is. Don’t compare yourself to others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can handle it. Find you. Find your community,” Crawford adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us don’t want to age the ways capitalism is selling. Our choices for old age seem to be either slowly withering into an armchair or desperately clinging to youth. But that’s not real. Crawford and Lishman aren’t superhuman. They’re just not buying what anti-aging culture is selling. They’re lifting heavier. Running farther. Thinking more clearly. And maybe most importantly, they’re not doing it alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting stronger after 50 isn’t a miracle. It’s a practice. And, as Crawford says, “If you think you can’t do it, you can’t do it. If you think you can do it, you can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Singapore</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 21:12:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE1QRUdvV3d5bE9OeHZDeTctbk9SRWZiS2s3Yk84eWFlT0ZQZmxuLVRZMi1TNjg5bTVwMmpseUVoUTZDYVF1UmRRU0Q0UXRaVVAtaHo1M292MXNkd1VWVGVwcE8yS0FBQU5fWWhVUnVpNGpmLTl6QkVVWGlvOUs</guid></item><item><title>这些健身图标在健身房比我们大多数人都更难。而且他们都超过50岁。-赫芬顿邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxQU1Rnd1UtYi1mWUdWb1pTQ0x5RzcyUzRLVjFyM0RhUWVBR2Nkb1NERkxTb3F3dGpldk9aZVBsUFpLSndWTWt6WkQwaUFXeC00UVZpbno4UHI3bGtjY1FxYUF0NGp4RmV5U05UWlZQdHItWXpXbmFJUDMyUlFpN1BXalZtUjE2Qk5SbC02eURkLWZBTWs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="word-1 first-three-words"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="word-2 first-three-words"&gt;most&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="word-3 first-three-words"&gt;pervasive&lt;/span&gt; myth about aging in our culture is that your body is winding down and the best you can do is manage the decline with grace.

Afroditi Lishman, a 52-year-old New Yorker, is sprinting and bear crawling her way past 20- and 30-somethings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And this is just the warm up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;(L-R) Afroditi Lishman and Crawford lifting weights and doing arm and leg exercises on the bar at Tone House.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Illustration: HuffPost; Photo by Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Illustration: HuffPost; Photo by Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tone House, a sports-performance studio in New York’s NoMad district, is infamous for its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/tone-house-workout-review-48451288" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="brutal conditioning workouts" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689b5bcee4b0196f49c506f9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/tone-house-workout-review-48451288" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;brutal conditioning workouts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Think pro football training meets bootcamp with a “You can do it!” ethos. Founder Alonzo Wilson built it to make elite training accessible. It’s become a kind of accidental laboratory for debunking bullshit ideas about aging and what older people can do, physically and mentally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because here’s the real story: Aging isn’t about decline. Or at least, it’s not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;just&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; about decline — not unless you’re actively neglecting your mind and body. Or, you know, actively being neglected by a medical and cultural system that treats older adults like they’re doddering and breakable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;“It’s my therapy,” Lishman says. “Training is a great booster to one’s confidence, mentally. That’s one of the main reasons why I work out.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s ageism,” says Teresa Liu-Ambrose, a physical therapy professor and Canada Research Chair in healthy eating at the University of British Columbia, when I ask her about the idea that people over a certain age should only do easy workouts. “And a misconception,” she adds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Liu-Ambrose should know. She’s been studying aging for decades. Her &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oMkpWbdL7fBZWiALnEebW8O28x9MykYhS7faO9FJUwo/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Brain Power Study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689b5bcee4b0196f49c506f9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oMkpWbdL7fBZWiALnEebW8O28x9MykYhS7faO9FJUwo/edit?tab=t.0" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brain Power Study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, published by the Archives of Internal Medicine journal in 2010, found that older women who lifted weights once or twice a week for a year improved their executive function. Even seniors showing early signs of cognitive decline saw better outcomes from resistance training than those who didn’t lift.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In other words, lifting weights helps your brain. And this, in turn, is crucial for overcoming the mental hurdle that rewriting the cultural script about aging and exercise requires.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Crawford, for example, spends his work days helping people. “All day long, I listen to other people’s problems and try to help them out,” says Crawford. “The gym is my outlet. Training helps me do my job. I’m a lot calmer, I’m a lot more empathetic.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lishman agrees. “It’s my therapy,” she says. “Training is a great booster to one’s confidence, mentally. That’s one of the main reasons why I work out.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mental clarity Lishman and Crawford are finding isn’t anecdotal. Liu-Ambrose has seen it in fMRI scans and cognitive tests. “After targeted exercise training, you can see actual... changes in brain function and also an increase in volume,” she says. That’s right. Lifting weights doesn’t just make your muscles bigger, it makes your brain healthier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Crawford and Lishman performing agility drills.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So if you’re worried about cognitive decline, working out is a no brainer. Most of us want to maintain the health of our bodies and brains as we get older, but we’ve also sort of collectively accepted the idea that we will all get weaker as we age. What if that’s not universally true?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Crawford, for example, says that he is now capable of things he wasn’t when he was “in his prime.” These days, he runs three miles after work. “Once upon a time, you couldn’t get me to run one mile,” he tells me. Twenty years ago, Mickey hated running. He tried cross country in high school and detested it. “Now,” he says, laughing, “I somewhat enjoy it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;On the left, Crawford performs weighted walking lunges, and on the right, Tone House Founder Alonzo Wilson coaches Crawford on a barbell back squat.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point is not that Crawford learned to love something he used to hate, it’s that he learned to do things that improve his health even if they aren’t his favorite activities. And not just in a perfunctory way, either. Crawford is considering running the New York Marathon in 2026. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Lishman says her ideas about what it means to get stronger have changed, too. “I’ve gained a new mindset,” she says. “Real growth comes from being uncomfortable — and still pushing forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no one’s being reckless. In fact, the smartest people in the room at Tone House, the 50+ crowd, have an especially nuanced sense of limits. “I know when to push and when to stop and when to recover,” Lishman tells me. “I push myself, but I know when it’s time to take a step back and not try to compete with anyone but myself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Lishman says her ideas about what it means to get stronger have changed, too: “I’ve gained a new mindset.” &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That hard earned wisdom is one of the beautiful ways that aging can make you more adaptive when it comes to training. And it’s exactly what Liu-Ambrose calls “smart progression,” training hard, but with purpose and adaptation. “Too quickly, too hard, and thinking that more is better is what gets people hurt,” she says. “Instead, you reassess every few weeks. If it’s easy, you increase the load. Your body responds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;What most people, of any age, fear about intense workouts is getting injured. No one here is naive about the reality of injury. Lishman, for example, trains with two torn menisci and a labrum tear. “I have many injuries,” she says. “But I know how to work around them.” A few days after a tough deadlift session, she noticed her right side, where she has scoliosis, felt tight. So she took a day off. Ten years ago, she says there’s no way she would have missed a workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of responsiveness — not pushing through pain, but also not shrinking from challenge — allows Lishman to keep training. “Closer to your 50s, you realize you don’t need to do eight workouts a week,” she says. “You just need to focus and go with a purpose. Do the one that challenges you, and then step back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Getting stronger after 50 isn’t a miracle. It’s a practice. And, as Crawford says, “If you think you can’t do it, you can’t do it. If you think you can do it, you can.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jutharat Pinyodoomnyachet for HuffPost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This isn’t just good judgment. It’s the foundation of long-term strength. Liu-Ambrose has seen it play out again and again in her research. In one of her early studies, she tells me, she worked with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15086643/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="older women who already had osteoporosis" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689b5bcee4b0196f49c506f9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15086643/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;older women who already had osteoporosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; or osteopenia — conditions that compromise bone health. In case you aren’t aware, bone density issues disproportionately affect older women. Women have lower bone density than men to begin with, and bone loss speeds up with the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/menopause-and-bone-loss" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="hormonal shifts that come with menopause" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689b5bcee4b0196f49c506f9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/menopause-and-bone-loss" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;hormonal shifts that come with menopause&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Through carefully designed, progressive resistance training, the women who participated in Liu-Ambrose’s study didn’t just preserve function ― they improved it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We had participants tell us that they hadn’t been able to take a bath for years,” she says. They were simply not strong enough to get down into the tub and back out again. “We saw a lot of transformation,” says Liu-Ambrose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That kind of transformation is mental and physical, but it’s also social. “It’s not just Tone House the workout, it’s Tone House the community,” says Crawford. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lishman agrees. “I’m going to five different weddings this year, and they’re all Tone House people,” she says. Through fitness, Crawford and Lishman have found belonging across age, ability, and even generation. “My 20-year-old son goes, ‘It’s a family affair,’” Afroditi says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That sense of family and community matters. “Socializing, in itself, is a cognitive task,” Liu-Ambrose says. “Exercise is good, but when you add social interactions to it, it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9053316/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="magnifies the benefits" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689b5bcee4b0196f49c506f9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9053316/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;magnifies the benefits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;“Closer to your 50s, you realize you don’t need to do eight workouts a week,” Lishman says. “You just need to focus and go with a purpose.

Don’t compare yourself to others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can handle it. Find you. Find your community,” Crawford adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us don’t want to age the ways capitalism is selling. Our choices for old age seem to be either slowly withering into an armchair or desperately clinging to youth. But that’s not real. Crawford and Lishman aren’t superhuman. They’re just not buying what anti-aging culture is selling. They’re lifting heavier. Running farther. Thinking more clearly. And maybe most importantly, they’re not doing it alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting stronger after 50 isn’t a miracle. It’s a practice. And, as Crawford says, “If you think you can’t do it, you can’t do it.

            For thousands of years, a disease repeatedly struck ancient Eurasia, quickly spreading far and wide. The bite of infected fleas that lived on rats passed on the plague in its most infamous form — &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/03/science/plague-gene-evolution"&gt;the Black Death&lt;/a&gt; of the 14th century — to humans, and remains its most common form of transmission today.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr000x3b6n2ijh90tu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the Bronze Age, however, the plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, had not yet developed the genetic tool kit that would allow later strains to be spread by fleas. Scientists have been baffled as to how the illness could have persisted at that time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr000y3b6nrfe5sljc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, an international team of researchers has recovered the first ancient Yersinia pestis genome from a nonhuman host — a Bronze Age domesticated sheep that lived around 4,000 years ago in what is now&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;modern-day Russia. The discovery has allowed the scientists to better understand the transmission and ecology of the disease in the ancient past, leading them to believe that livestock played a role in its spread throughout Eurasia. The findings were published Monday in the &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)00851-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867425008517%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank"&gt;journal Cell&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr000z3b6n9e4z9o7f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Yersinia pestis is a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/about-zoonotic-diseases.html" target="_blank"&gt;zoonotic&lt;/a&gt; disease (transmitted between humans and animals) that emerged during prehistory, but so far the way that we have studied it using ancient DNA has been completely from human remains, which left us with a lot of questions and few answers about how humans were getting infected,” said lead author Ian Light-Maka, a doctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin. There have been nearly 200 Y. pestis genomes recovered from ancient humans, the researchers wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr00103b6nyfs1jfh2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Finding the ancient bacterium in an animal not only helps researchers understand how the bacterial lineage evolved, but it could also have implications for understanding modern diseases, Light-Maka added via email. “Evolution can sometimes be ‘lazy,’ finding the same type of solution independently for a similar problem — the genetic tools that worked for pestis to thrive for over 2000 years across over Eurasia might be reused again.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr00113b6no6szhgrh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The ancient bacterium that caused the Eurasia plague, known today as the Late Neolithic Bronze Age lineage, spread from Europe all the way to Mongolia, with evidence of the disease found across 6,000 kilometers (3,700 miles).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr00123b6n26ha3dl9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recent evidence suggests that the majority of modern human diseases emerged within the last 10,000 years and coincided with the domestication of animals such as livestock and pets, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1093834" target="_blank"&gt;release &lt;/a&gt;from the German research institute. Scientists suspected that animals other than rodents were a part of the enormous puzzle of the Bronze Age plague transmission, but without any bacterial genomes recovered from animal hosts, it was not clear which ones.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr00133b6nsodqv64g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To find the ancient plague genome, the study authors investigated Bronze Age animal remains from an archaeological site in Russia known as Arkaim. The settlement was once associated with a culture called Sintashta-Petrovka, known for its innovations in livestock. There, the researchers discovered the missing connection — the tooth of a 4,000-year-old sheep that was infected with the same plague bacteria found in humans from that area.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr00143b6naqbxl0po@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Finding infected livestock suggests that the domesticated sheep served as a bridge between the humans and infected wild animals, said Dr. Taylor Hermes, a study coauthor and an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Arkansas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr00153b6n2h9ow08v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re sort of unveiling this in real time and trying to get a sense for how Bronze Age nomadic herders out in the Eurasian &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/the-Steppe" target="_blank"&gt;Steppe&lt;/a&gt; were setting the stage for disease transmission that potentially led to impacts elsewhere,” Hermes said, “not only in later in time, but also in a much more distant, distant landscape.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr00163b6n6ol9xark@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During this time within the Eurasian Steppe, as many as 20% of the bodies in some cemeteries are those of people who were infected with, and most likely died from, the plague, making it an extremely pervasive disease, Hermes said. While livestock are seemingly a part of what made the disease so widespread, they are only one piece of the puzzle. The identification of the bacterial lineage in an animal opens new avenues for researching this disease’s evolution as well as the later lineage that caused the Black Death in Europe and the plague that’s still around today, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr00173b6nnrmpu3ty@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not surprising, but it is VERY cool to see (the DNA) isolated from an ancient animal. It’s extremely difficult to find it in humans and even more so in animal remains, so this is really interesting and significant,” Hendrik Poinar, evolutionary geneticist and director of the Ancient DNA Centre at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, wrote in an email. Poinar was not involved with the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr00183b6nc2z63jwd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is likely that humans and animals were passing the strains back and forth, but it isn’t clear how they did so — or how sheep were infected in the first place. It is possible sheep picked up the bacteria through a food or water source and then transmitted the disease to humans via the animal’s contaminated meat, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr00193b6na9joy3r3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think it shows how extremely successful (if you want to label it that way) this particular pathogen has been,” Poinar added. He, as well as the study’s authors, said they hope that further research uncovers other animals infected with the ancient strain to further the understanding of the disease’s spread and evolution.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr001a3b6n9wgqkzlf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the plague lineage that persisted during the Bronze Age is extinct, Yersinia pestis is still around in parts of Africa and Asia as well as the western United States, Brazil and Peru. But it’s rare to encounter the bacteria, with only 1,000 to 2,000 cases of plague annually &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17782-plague" target="_blank"&gt;worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr001b3b6nyfaul3t4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is no need for alarm when it comes to dealing with livestock and pets, Hermes said. The findings are a reminder that animals carry diseases that are transmittable to humans. Be cautious when cooking meat, or to take care when bitten by an animal, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme8xuewr001c3b6n1nu1qgsq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The takeaway is that humans aren’t alone in disease, and this has been true for thousands of years. The ways we are drastically changing our environment and how wild and domesticated animals are connected to us have the potential to change how disease can come into our communities,” Light-Maka said. “And if you see a dead prairie dog, maybe don’t go and touch it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Eyewitness News 3, anybody who encounters the infected rabbits must avoid all contact and stay away from them, even though it doesn't consider CPRV to be contagious across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Researchers suggest that the 'Frankenstein' variations could spread throughout the Midwest, carried by mosquitoes and ticks which bite the infected ones and transport their hideous conditions as opposed to direct contact between rabbits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As for how CRPV affects the host, it all begins with red, raised spots on the skin that eventually mutate into warty masses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The next phase of infection is the emergence of black tendrils covering the mouth, cheek and eye areas, although some of the initial warts can in fact transform into life-threatening skin &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;The furry mammals cannot spread the cottontail papilloma virus themselves, only through insect transportation (Reddit)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wlbt.com/2025/08/09/rabbits-spotted-with-tentacle-like-growths-their-faces/"&gt;Speaking to&lt;/a&gt; WLBT3 about the horror of it all, Fort Collins resident Susan Mansfield said about witnessing an infected rabbit out in the open: "It looked like black quills or black toothpicks sticking out all around its mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"I thought he'd die off during the winter, but he didn't. He came back a second year – and it grew."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Medical experts are urging domestic rabbit owners to keep their pets away from pests, but if they do succumb to a mosquito bite, vets can surgically remove the tumours before malignancy sets in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Out in the wild, the infected patients are likely to starve to death when their horns grow larger and larger, effectively eliminating their ability to see, eat or hear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;One of the infected specimens pictured in Colorado (Reddit)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In similarly stomach-churning news, did you know that kilograms of the parasitic fungus that inspired &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us &lt;/em&gt;can sell for as much as $110,000?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Labelled 'ophiocordyceps unilateralis', or the zombie-ant fungus, it kills insects before commandeering their corpses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It also comes in several different forms, often differentiated by the animal that the fungus takes over, and one particular type found in caterpillars called Cordyceps militaris or 'Scarlet Caterpillarclub' is available on the market and has some alleged medical benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Some Cordyceps species are traditionally used in Chinese medicine and cuisine, but there's no evidence to suggest that ophiocordyceps unilateralis can be safely consumed by humans - so do not try it at home!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>UNILAD</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 19:43:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQa2E1Vk5XdDlNSUZBMGl5VDVsTm9jS2VNQU04QXNUTEpZZktrOXFoOW9SNWVsM0VfUGRTejMzWlR1SllBS1FDM3dQOG5yaW5hVG9VNzdVM09lRThBQjFMMUR0eTFyYllJazg4SVJYcU8xYWVQTWdVcE02YXZucW15MzRMc3dVcFdUaTI1S2JoTUg4X2tVNTUySjFKWUVhT19yZVJpdk9lY3Q</guid></item><item><title>“高峰时间” ：西尼罗河病毒的风险目前在10个马萨诸塞州社区中居高不下。以下是列表-波士顿25新闻</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="default__ArticleBody-sc-tl066j-1 jPcFTl article-body-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;BOSTON — The risk for West Nile virus is now high in 10 Massachusetts communities, state public health officials said Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;The risk level for the mosquito-borne virus has been elevated in the following municipalities: Acton, Bedford, Billerica, Boston, Brookline, Carlisle, Chelmsford, Dracut, Lowell, and Newton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;Tuesday’s announcement comes as &lt;a href="https://www.boston25news.com/weather/air-quality-alert-canadian-wildfire-smoke-thick-across-massachusetts-today/TDNB3M3ZZBGRJD3QTIZDCJIB7I/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.boston25news.com/weather/air-quality-alert-canadian-wildfire-smoke-thick-across-massachusetts-today/TDNB3M3ZZBGRJD3QTIZDCJIB7I/"&gt;the region is experiencing a heat wave&lt;/a&gt;

Consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during the evening, after 6 p.m. or early morning. Otherwise, take extra care to use repellent and protective clothing. Mosquitoes can be active during daylight hours when the temperatures are cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clothing can help reduce mosquito bites.&lt;/b&gt; Although it may be difficult to do when it is hot, wearing long sleeves, long pants and socks when outdoors will help keep mosquitoes away from your skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Apply insect repellent when you go outdoors&lt;/b&gt;. Use a repellent with DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide), permethrin, picaridin (KBR 3023) or oil of lemon eucalyptus [p-methane 3, 8-diol (PMD)] according to the instructions on the product label. DEET products should not be used on infants younger than 2 months of age and should be used in concentrations of 30 percent or less on older children. Oil of lemon eucalyptus should not be used on children younger than 3 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mosquito-proof your Home and drain standing water.&lt;/b&gt; Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water. Limit the number of places around your home for mosquitoes to breed by either draining or getting rid of items that hold water. Check rain gutters and drains. Empty any unused flowerpots and wading pools, and change water in birdbaths frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Install or repair screens.&lt;/b&gt; Some mosquitoes like to come indoors. Keep them outside by having tightly fitted screens on all windows and doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Protect your animals. &lt;/b&gt;Animal owners should reduce potential mosquito breeding sites on their property by eliminating standing water from containers such as buckets, tires, and wading pools – especially after heavy rains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;Water troughs provide excellent mosquito breeding habitats and should be flushed out at least once a week during the summer months to reduce mosquitoes near paddock areas. Horse owners should keep horses in indoor stalls at night to reduce their risk of exposure to mosquitoes. Owners should also speak with their veterinarian about mosquito repellents approved for use in animals and vaccinations to prevent WNV and EEE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;If an animal is suspected of having West Nile Virus or EEE, owners are required to report to the Department of Agricultural Resources, Division of Animal Health by calling 617-626-1795, and to the Department of Public Health by calling 617- 983-6800.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;More information, including all West Nile Virus- and EEE-positive results can be found at this &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/mosquito-borne-disease-prevention" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/mosquito-borne-disease-prevention"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; or by calling the DPH Division of Epidemiology at 617-983-6800.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a developing story.

			&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods already have a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-how-ultra-processed-foods-may-fuel-bowel-cancer"&gt;lousy reputation&lt;/a&gt; – and now a new study suggests that even 'healthy' versions of them can significantly undermine your weight-loss efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the UK and US analyzed data from 50 overweight people who completed two diet programs on separate occasions. Both diets matched &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-should-eat-more-of-these-8-healthy-foods-and-heres-why"&gt;in terms of nutrition&lt;/a&gt; – with the same amounts of fat (including saturated fats), carbs, fiber, salt, and even &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fruits-and-vegetables-have-a-surprising-effect-on-depression-risk"&gt;fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key difference is one diet was built around &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-processed_food"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; (UPFs), and the other focused on minimally processed foods (MPFs). The UPF diet included the likes of breakfast oat bars and lasagne ready meals, while the MPF one featured overnight oats and homemade spaghetti bolognese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-processed-foods-linked-to-early-signs-of-parkinsons-disease"&gt;Ultra-Processed Foods Linked to Early Signs of Parkinson's Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both diets resulted in weight loss. But the MPF diet was associated with shedding twice as much weight as the UPF diet, on average. Participants also lost more unhealthy body fat while on the MPF diet and reported better control over unhealthy &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-ways-you-can-resist-food-cravings-and-stick-to-healthy-eating"&gt;food cravings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Previous research has linked ultra-processed foods with poor health outcomes," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/aug/less-processed-diet-may-be-more-beneficial-weight-loss"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; clinical scientist Samuel Dicken, from University College London (UCL). "But not all ultra-processed foods are inherently unhealthy based on their nutritional profile."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The main aim of this trial was to fill crucial gaps in our knowledge about the role of food processing in the context of existing dietary guidance, and how it affects health outcomes such as weight, blood pressure, and body composition, as well as experiential factors like food cravings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170263" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170263" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/WeightLoss.jpg" alt="Weight loss graph" class="wp-image-170263 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/WeightLoss.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/WeightLoss-449x415.jpg 449w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/WeightLoss-600x555.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170263" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Greater weight loss was seen with the minimally processed food diet. (Dicken et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the overall reductions in weight were only 2 percent for the MPF diet and 1 percent for the UPF diet, the researchers point out the short timespan of the study: eight weeks for each diet, with a gap of four weeks in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes seen here could quickly add up. In combination with other factors that contribute &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-30-year-study-may-have-found-the-single-best-diet-for-healthy-aging"&gt;to a healthy and effective diet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-review-of-ultra-processed-foods-confirms-just-how-harmful-they-are"&gt;avoiding ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; could make a noticeable difference over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Though a 2 percent reduction may not seem very big, that is only over eight weeks and without people trying to actively reduce their intake," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/aug/less-processed-diet-may-be-more-beneficial-weight-loss"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Dicken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we scaled these results up over the course of a year, we'd expect to see a 13 percent weight reduction in men and a 9 percent reduction in women on the minimally processed diet, but only a 4 percent weight reduction in men and 5 percent in women after the ultra-processed diet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial was relatively small and excluded people with dietary restrictions, but it offers more evidence on how we can tackle our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/to-tackle-our-obesity-crisis-experts-say-everything-we-do-must-change"&gt;growing obesity crisis&lt;/a&gt; – and highlights the difference that &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-guidelines-and-food-labels/the-eatwell-guide/"&gt;following nutritional guidelines&lt;/a&gt; in diets can have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The global food system at the moment drives diet-related poor health and obesity, particularly because of the wide availability of cheap, unhealthy food," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/aug/less-processed-diet-may-be-more-beneficial-weight-loss"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Chris van Tulleken, a global health and infection researcher at UCL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study highlights the importance of ultra-processing in driving health outcomes in addition to the role of nutrients like fat, salt, and sugar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03842-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Those proteins rise, fall, and shift as the years stack up, shaping organ function and health over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large study recently published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; follows protein patterns across the human body to map when and where aging speeds up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research tracks the molecules that build structures, relay signals, and handle cleanup inside cells, where wear and tear accumulates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By watching proteins rather than just reading genetic instructions, the study offers a more direct view of how organs change across adult life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-proteins-and-human-aging"&gt;Proteins and human aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work comes from scientists at the &lt;a href="https://english.cas.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chinese Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, who focused on proteins because they are the end products that carry out cellular functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their aim was to chart how protein levels change along with human aging in many organs at once and to compare those shifts with RNA – the cellular templates used to make proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study is poised to construct a comprehensive multi-tissue proteomic atlas spanning 50 years of the entire human aging process, elucidating the mechanisms behind &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4539002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;proteostasis imbalance&lt;/a&gt; in aged organs and revealing both universal and tissue-specific aging patterns,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-study-measured"&gt;What the study measured&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team measured more than 12,700 proteins in samples from 13 human tissues, plus blood. Donors ranged from 14 to 68 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, the analysis covered 516 tissue specimens with ultra-sensitive mass spectrometry and matching RNA readouts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tissue set drew from 76 organ donors who died of accidental traumatic brain injury, providing a broad snapshot of adult biology across several decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on aging-associated protein changes, we developed tissue-specific &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/"&gt;proteomic age&lt;/a&gt; clocks and characterized organ-level aging trajectories,” explained the team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Temporal analysis revealed an aging inflection around age 50, with blood vessels being a tissue that ages early and is markedly susceptible to aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tissues-on-different-schedules"&gt;Tissues on different schedules&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pace of change isn’t uniform across the body. The starkest shifts clustered between 45 and 55, when many tissues remodeled their protein profiles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within that window, the aorta showed the most marked change, and the pancreas and spleen exhibited sustained shifts that stood out against more gradual patterns elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signals of aging didn’t wait for midlife in every case. The adrenal glands and the aorta began to drift from youthful protein patterns around age 30, hinting at stress-hormone and vascular changes that precede later organ shifts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample set spanned seven systems: &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/a-century-of-progress-in-the-fight-against-cardiovascular-disease/"&gt;cardiovascular&lt;/a&gt; (heart and aorta), digestive (liver, pancreas, and intestine), &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/daylight-boosts-the-immune-systems-ability-to-fight-infections/"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; (spleen and lymph node), endocrine (adrenal gland and white adipose), respiratory (lung), integumentary (skin), and musculoskeletal (muscle), along with blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-weakens-protein-connections"&gt;Aging weakens protein connections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that the connection between RNA templates and the proteins they should produce weakens with age. Cells appear less able to translate instructions into the right protein levels at the right times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-aging-linked-to-sluggish-production-of-key-proteins/"&gt;proteostasis&lt;/a&gt; – the machinery that builds, folds, and recycles proteins – loses strength. Ribosomes, chaperones, and proteasomes trended downward, while amyloid-type protein clumps accumulated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those clumps interacted with immune and complement proteins and fed chronic, low-level inflammation known as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-018-0059-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;inflammaging&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One molecule, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/serum-amyloid-p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;serum amyloid P&lt;/a&gt; (SAP), stood out as consistently increased across organs and, in laboratory tests, pushed young blood-vessel cells toward an older, inflamed state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-disease-linked-proteins-rise"&gt;Disease-linked proteins rise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers compared their catalog to disease databases, expression levels of 48 disease-related proteins increased with aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The signals touched conditions such as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-disease-remains-the-leading-cause-of-death-worldwide/"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, tissue fibrosis, fatty liver disease, and liver-related tumors, indicating that common age-associated risks have echoes in the protein data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03164-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;proteomic clocks&lt;/a&gt; built by the team for each tissue reached strong accuracy, with correlations up to 0.95.

Instead, experts including Dr. Chiang suggest focusing more on complex, fiber-rich sources of the macro, like vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and fruits, and reducing refined sugars (like those found in packaged desserts) and ultra-processed carbohydrate sources (like those found in chips and fast food).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="myth-1-sugar-isnt-a-carb" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;With that in mind, here are some common misconceptions around carbs and sugar to have on your radar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="7" data-lazy-id="P0-14"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Myth #1: Sugar isn’t a carb." data-anchor-id="myth-1-sugar-isnt-a-carb" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;Myth #1: Sugar isn’t a carb.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p id="sugar-is-a-carb-but-not-all-carbs-are-sugar-and-not-all-carbs-or-sugars-are-bad-says-tk" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Sugar is a carb, but not all carbs are sugar, says Corwin. Sugar is actually one of three types of carbohydrates, which also include starch and fiber, Corwin explains. “Sugar is the simplest form—think table sugar, honey, or the natural sugars in fruit (fructose) or dairy (lactose),” she adds. “But complex carbs like quinoa or black beans? Those are in the same family, just with more fiber, protein, and staying power.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Simple sugar is the easiest to over-consume because it’s not satiating and has the least nutritional value. It quickly spikes blood sugar, whereas fiber and starch, also known as complex carbs, are broken down with a more gentle and steady blood sugar release that provides the body with more energy for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“I like to incorporate sugar when it helps you to make whole foods more palatable,” says Corwin. “Perhaps a drizzle of a balsamic glaze over roasted vegetables, a spoonful of pure maple syrup over acorn squash, chocolate hummus with strawberries or cucumber, or even a drizzle of honey in green tea,” she says. Just be mindful of your overall total. “The American Heart Association &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/how-much-sugar-is-too-much" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sugar/how-much-sugar-is-too-much" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="recommends" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; we keep the total to six teaspoons (24 grams) or less per day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="11" data-lazy-id="P0-15"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Myth #2: The sugar in fruit and candy get processed in the same way." data-anchor-id="myth-2-the-sugar-in-fruit-and-candy-get-processed-in-the-same-way" class="css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;Myth #2: The sugar in fruit and candy get processed in the same way.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The belief here is that natural sugars and added sugars are one and the same, which isn’t necessarily true. “The sugar in fruit comes packaged with fiber, antioxidants, and water, which helps slow absorption and supports metabolic health,” says Dr. Chiang. “It’s a very different scenario from drinking a sugary beverage or eating candy.” Fiber from foods with natural sugars like fruit can also help maintain digestive regularity, lower cholesterol, and promote satiety, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="13" data-lazy-id="P0-16"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Myth #3: Artificial sweeteners are worse than added sugar." data-anchor-id="myth-3-artificial-sweeteners-are-worse-than-added-sugar" class="css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;Myth #3: Artificial sweeteners are worse than added sugar.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The data is still evolving, and some &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a60672537/artificial-sweeteners-may-damage-gut-health-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a60672537/artificial-sweeteners-may-damage-gut-health-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="potential health risks" data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;potential health risks&lt;/a&gt; related to the overuse of artificial sweeteners have surfaced. But, moderate use of some low-calorie sweeteners may be helpful for people trying to reduce their added sugar intake, especially if they’re managing insulin resistance or prediabetes, says Dr. Chiang. “It really depends on the individual’s overall diet and response,” she concludes, which means it’s &lt;strong data-node-id="14.3"&gt;best to talk to your doctor before upping your artificial sweetener intake if you have one of these conditions&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="15" data-lazy-id="P0-17"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Myth #4: Your body needs sugar for energy." data-anchor-id="myth-4-your-body-needs-sugar-for-energy" class="css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;Myth #4: Your body needs sugar for energy.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Yes, glucose is technically the body’s preferred energy source, explains Corwin, but you don’t need to get it in its simplest form, especially because those quick hits are just that, quick, and won’t sustain you for very long. “Your body can get glucose from a range of healthy carbs like fruit, beans, and grains,” Corwin says. “Balanced meals with fiber and protein keep your energy more stable than a sugar hit ever could.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="17" data-lazy-id="P0-18"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Myth #5: You should eliminate sugar completely during menopause." data-anchor-id="myth-5-you-should-eliminate-sugar-completely-during-menopause" class="css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;Myth #5: You should eliminate sugar completely during menopause.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s true that when estrogen declines during menopause, insulin sensitivity becomes a concern, Corwin reiterates. “Yet this all-or-nothing thinking is the real problem,” she says. “Total elimination usually leads to craving and eventual overdoing it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="19" class="body-h4 css-12fmbeu emevuu60"&gt;“A little sugar in a nutrient-rich context can absolutely fit in a balanced plan.” &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Corwin recommends trying dark chocolate with almonds or honey in oats when cravings strike. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="21" data-lazy-id="P0-19"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Myth #6: Eating low-carb is the best strategy during perimenopause and post-menopause." data-anchor-id="myth-6-eating-low-carb-is-the-best-strategy-during-perimenopause-and-post-menopause" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;Myth #6: Eating low-carb is the best strategy during perimenopause and post-menopause.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="body-text css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“While some people do well with reduced-carb patterns, others may not,” says Dr. Chiang. “Carbohydrates, especially those from whole plant sources, can still be part of a balanced, nourishing diet in menopause.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Overeating any food can lead to weight gain, not just carbs,” adds &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lauren Manaker, M.S., R.D.N., L.D." data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a Charleston-based registered dietitian. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="24" class="body-h4 css-12fmbeu emevuu60"&gt;“Carbs are an essential energy source, and choosing nutrient-dense options like whole grains and fruit can actually support a healthy weight.”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Complex carbs are also contributors to other aspects of health, such as supporting your gut microbiome, keeping the stress hormone cortisol in check, and helping to produce serotonin for mood and melatonin for sleep, Corwin says.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ultra-processed foods dominate the U.S. diet and raise heart disease risk, but some—like whole-grain cereals or plain yogurt—can still be healthy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good picks include frozen produce, low-sodium beans, nuts, and high-fiber cereals, while processed meats, sugary drinks, and refined breads are best limited.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swaps like plain yogurt with fruit or sparkling water, plus smart use of frozen or canned basics, can cut harmful UPFs without losing convenience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you've noticed a lot of headlines around ultra-processed foods lately, you're not imagining it. There have been several recent studies linking ultra-processed foods (UPFs)—which contain ingredients and chemicals that aren't generally available to a home cook—to a &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/new-study-processed-meats-and-sugary-drinks-health-effects-11766475" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;variety of health issues&lt;/a&gt;, from cardiovascular disease to &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/ultra-processed-foods-linked-to-a-higher-risk-of-premature-death-11724609" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;risk of premature death&lt;/a&gt;.

"Nearly 60% of U.S. calories come from UPFs—and adolescents fare worst, correlating with poorer heart health scores."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But before you clean out your pantry, there is some nuance when it comes to processed foods, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001365" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; from the American Heart Association. And in fact, some can actually be beneficial to your health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The American Health Association found that processed foods that contain additives and chemicals often have other not-so-great ingredients that put you at risk of cardiovascular disease, chronic diseases, and death, including unhealthy fats and added sugars and salts. And processed food takes up more than 70% of what's available at your local grocery store, so it can be harder than you'd expect to avoid them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The American Heart Association recommends limiting your UPF intake and focusing your diet on vegetables, fruits, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/healthiest-grains" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt;, beans, nuts, seeds, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-cooking-oil-according-to-registered-dietitians-11787054" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthy oils&lt;/a&gt;, and lean proteins. But in this new research, they've taken a stab at defining which UPFs are the most dangerous to your health—and which ones aren't.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Not all UPFs are equally harmful: Items like whole-grain cereals or yogurt may carry lower or even inverse cardiovascular disease risk compared with sugary beverages or processed meats," Derocha says. "The science recognizes the complexity—UPF is a broad category, and context matters. We should differentiate between 'unhealthy UPFs' and more wholesome packaged items."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-choose-healthier-processed-foods"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Choose Healthier Processed Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You don't have to give up the convenience of processed foods entirely in order to reduce your risk of negative health effects. Just follow these tips—based on the new research—to help you create a shopping list that'll focus on your health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Opt for "Green-Flag" Processed Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the reasons that ultra-processed foods have proliferated? They make it much simpler to get dinner on the table—just heat and eat. But you don't have to rely on heavily processed foods to simplify your food prep. "Convenience doesn’t equal compromise," Derocha says. "Smart choices like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/vegetables-you-should-buy-frozen-not-fresh-8728251" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;frozen produce&lt;/a&gt;, canned staples, and wisely selected UPFs can make healthy eating accessible."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Among the "green-flagged" processed foods that are considered healthier:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Lightly salted and flavored nuts, seeds, and legumes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low-sodium canned beans and legumes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low-sodium canned tuna, salmon, or chicken, packed in water&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unsweetened dried fruit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low-sodium whole grain breads and crackers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fiber cereal with minimal sweeteners&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plant-based meat and dairy alternatives like soy milk and tofu&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frozen produce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are also a few "caution" items that are considered moderately healthy, such as canned fruit in light syrup or juice, hard cheeses, and low-sodium and/or low-fat canned soups or canned beans that contain salt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Minimize "Red-Flag" Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The American Heart Association chart reviews both processed and unprocessed foods for their potential impacts on cardiovascular health—which includes a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001365" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;list of red-flagged foods&lt;/a&gt; that could put your health at risk. "Identifying high-risk UPF subgroups is essential to balancing nutritional goals with the need for accessible and appealing food options," according to the study. "Most UPFs overlap with foods high in saturated fat, added sugars, and sodium, which are already targets for cardiometabolic risk reduction."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Processed meats like bacon, chicken nuggets, sausage, and hot dogs, and sugar-sweetened beverages are high on the list of red-flag foods, but you probably won't be surprised by what is on the list:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Processed meats, like chicken nuggets, sausage, hot dogs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sugar-sweetened beverages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sweets like cookies, candies, and fruit snacks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cheese products&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;White bread, tortillas, and rolls&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ice cream and other dairy-based desserts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frozen meals that contain things on this list (like pizza or instant noodles)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Canned fruit in syrup&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tortilla or potato-based chips&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But the paper also called out some minimally processed foods that could be harmful to your health. That list includes:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Meat and dairy products, including red meat, pork, butter, beef tallow, and sour cream&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Natural sweeteners, like sugar, honey, and maple syrup&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sweetened dried or canned fruit and brined vegetables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;French fries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crackers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;100% fruit juice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tropical oils, like palm and coconut oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some of these foods are often on lists of healthier options, and Derocha notes that they may be more of a "sometimes" food, rather than a wholesale ban. "While honey is minimally processed, it’s still a concentrated source of sugar—making it less heart-friendly than, say, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/cooking-tips-techniques/whole-wheat-whole-grain-breads-0" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole-grain bread&lt;/a&gt; or canned beans that offer fiber and nutrients. It’s less about processing level and more about overall contributions to cardiovascular health."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Make Healthier Swaps &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're looking to reduce your ultra-processed food intake, there are some easy swaps that are just as delicious—and won't raise your health risks. "Try sparkling water flavored with fruit instead of soda; make yogurt parfaits with plain yogurt and fruit instead of pre-sweetened cartons," Derocha suggests.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/red-flags-on-food-labels-8781749" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;check the ingredient list&lt;/a&gt;. "Look for UPFs that include whole grains, legumes, yogurt, or nuts—not just isolated additives," Derocha says. "Cereals, yogurts, and whole-grain products are among UPFs associated with lower cardiovascular risk." You'll also want to limit or avoid foods that have a huge list of chemicals among their ingredients. "Favor foods with fewer, recognizable ingredients—avoid long lists of additives, emulsifiers, sweeteners," Derocha says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Find Other Ways to Speed Up Meal Prep &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Choosing minimally processed building blocks like frozen fruits and veggies, canned beans, and frozen whole grains can help you get your meal on the plate faster, Derocha says. "You can also &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/meal-prep-hacks-8687280" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;meal prep&lt;/a&gt; simple components," she suggests. "Roast a batch of chicken or bake vegetables ahead, then mix and match throughout the week."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can also consider batch cooking, in which you make a larger batch of a favorite dish and freeze the leftovers for a busy weeknight. "Cook once, and eat twice," Derocha says. "Allowing the freezer to be your friend is a great way to be in the driver’s seat of what you are consuming."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The case is the first in the region in more than 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KOOTENAI COUNTY, Idaho — The Idaho Panhandle Health District (PHD) is reporting the first confirmed measles case in the region in more than 30 years. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHD says the infection was found in an unvaccinated child in Kootenai County. This is the first case in a resident of Idaho since 2023 and the first case in the northern Panhandle since 1991. PHD says it is working to identify how the individual contracted measles and contacting the known locations that the individual visited while infectious to inform anyone who may have been exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious virus and spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. The virus can stay in the air for two hours after an infected person has left. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHD says symptoms typically appear seven to 14 days after exposure and include high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a distinctive rash. While many recover without problems, measles can lead to serious complications, especially in very young children and people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHD encourages everyone to verify their family’s vaccination records with their primary care provider. A person is considered immune if they were born before January 1, 1957, have a documented history of laboratory-confirmed measles, or have documentation that they received both doses of the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHD says the measles vaccine is highly effective, and for most people, two childhood doses of the vaccine are all they will ever need to protect themselves against measles for their lifetime. In the United States, the MMR vaccine is given to children between 12 and 15 months of age, followed by another dose at 4 to 6 years of age. It can be given as early as 6 months of age for those who are traveling to areas with known measles infections or in the event of a local outbreak of measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, cases of measles began to increase in the U.S. So far in 2025, there have already been more cases than in all of 2024, with cases reported in 41 jurisdictions, including Washington, Montana, Oregon and Wyoming. Among those cases, 13% have been hospitalized, most of them children.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you or a family member is experiencing measles symptoms, please call your primary care provider immediately.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;PHD says it is important to call your doctor before going in. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

It makes me wonder why he’s even with me. We recently had a brief breakup, and he told me he would give all that stuff up if he could be with me, but I am doubtful. I don’t really trust that he has much self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

I used to do some of it, but I have matured and changed, and would prefer to have a relatively normal, heterosexual relationship. He says he’s OK with such a relationship, but I don’t know if I’m OK with being such a huge disappointment to him.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme8n1l98000u3b78j2tdcyk6@published"&gt;If you’re in an open relationship, is it possible that he feels significantly fulfilled by you in several ways and is looking for partners who fulfill the roles you aren’t interested in? And, if he set this up during your break, could it be in some part a reaction to the breakup? Most importantly, though, you’re going to have to ask your boyfriend what his motivations and goals were and &lt;em&gt;be able to believe him when he responds&lt;/em&gt;. That’s going to be the biggest factor in whether the two of you can have a healthy relationship—whether you’re able to trust and speak openly with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

If your family has met him, check in with them about their opinions (omitting the sex aspects as needed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hemorrhoids are no fun. These swollen, sometimes twisted veins in the anus and lower rectum are an unpleasant reality for millions of people, causing symptoms like itching, pain and sometimes even bleeding.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fortunately, they are treatable with a variety of therapies, such as creams, over-the-counter meds and sitz baths. But before you get to the point that you have to head to the drugstore, it can be helpful to know that eating certain foods may proactively help you head off hemorrhoids.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Kiwi is one of my favorite fruits for constipation and hemorrhoids,” says&lt;a href="https://nutritionresolution.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;digestive-health dietitian &lt;a href="https://nutritionresolution.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alyssa Simpson, RDN, CGN, CLT&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s high in soluble fiber and contains an enzyme called actinidin that’s been shown to help move things along gently.” Just one little green kiwi gives you 2 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These fruits are so effective for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7940041/best-fruit-for-constipation-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;constipation relief&lt;/a&gt; that one study found that when people with constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) ate two green kiwis daily for four weeks, they experienced an average of 1½ additional bowel movements per week. They also said that their digestive systems felt more comfortable overall.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Barley has been cultivated for thousands of years. But this highly nutritious grain doesn’t always get its due in modern-day eating. For instance, it’s bursting with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8024705/theprep-30-minute-high-fiber-dinners-to-help-you-poop/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;digestion-friendly fiber&lt;/a&gt; (6 grams per cooked cup).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “This whole grain contains soluble fiber, which holds water in the intestines and keeps stool soft,” says Kulp. The result: less straining and fewer hemorrhoids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve never tried barley before, whip up a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/280997/vegetable-barley-soup/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;veggie-barley soup&lt;/a&gt; or serve it as a simple side with chicken, pork or fish.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On movie night, nobody needs to know you’re reaching for the popcorn to help your hemorrhoids. But if you’re experiencing discomfort down below, it’s probably a good idea! For every cup you crunch, you’ll score 1.2 grams of fiber (and who only eats 1 cup?)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Kulp notes that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/2-ingredient-fiber-packed-snack-11696385" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;popcorn contains insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which speeds up the movement of the digestive system. So, get popping to get pooping!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Prune juice is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7889310/drinks-for-better-digestion/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;digestive-health classic&lt;/a&gt; for a reason. The beverage lives up to its reputation for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-before-in-the-morning-to-help-you-poop-11718405" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;promoting easier-to-pass stool&lt;/a&gt;. Consider the results of one study of chronically constipated volunteers. After drinking slightly less than 2 ounces of prune juice daily for eight weeks, they had softer stools and less constipation without unpleasant GI symptoms like gassiness or an inconvenient urge to rush to the bathroom.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re wondering why prune juice is so effective, it turns out that there are multiple reasons it works. “It’s the unique mix of sorbitol, fiber and polyphenols that gives it such a gentle but effective edge,” says Simpson. “It’s one of my favorite natural tools for smoother BMs.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-lentils"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Lentils &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High-fiber pulses (aka edible dried seeds in the legume family) are another top choice for alleviating hemorrhoid pressure. While it’s smart to reach for almost any of the foods in the pulse family, Kulp says lentils are especially helpful thanks to their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-resistant-starch-11749332" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;resistant starch&lt;/a&gt;. “This type of starch resists digestion in the small intestine, so when it arrives in the large intestine, it becomes food for the good gut microbes, helping them thrive.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Considering that research has found that a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy microbiome&lt;/a&gt; may protect against constipation, there’s good reason to add some lentils to your weekly meal rotation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They’re an easy way to pump up the fiber in soups and salads. You can also blend them into smoothies or simmer them with warm spices for a hearty, fiber-rich breakfast porridge.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-ground-flaxseed"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Ground Flaxseed &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ground flaxseed not only adds a hint of earthy flavor to baked goods, oatmeal, smoothies and more, but it could also spell hemorrhoid relief. Simpson points to one study in which constipated elderly adults who ate 50 grams of flaxseed daily for one month had more frequent bowel movements and less constipation. And less constipation may translate to fewer hemorrhoids.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s not the only way ground flaxseed might keep hemorrhoids at bay. “They also increased levels of gut bacteria linked to better gut motility, giving both symptom relief and microbial support,” notes Simpson.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As encouraging as this research is, 50 grams of ground flaxseed is about a half-cup, providing nearly 11 grams of fiber. So, eating that much flaxseed daily might not be very comfortable if you don’t usually eat these fiber-rich seeds. But remember that every little bit adds up. Even blending 2 tablespoons into a smoothie or shake delivers 3 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-apples"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 7. Apples &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Could an apple a day keep the hemorrhoids away? Quite possibly. “Apples are a delicious snack and a great source of two kinds of fiber,” says Kulp. “The inside of the apple is soluble fiber, and the skin is insoluble. The perfect combination!” This may be why research has found that eating apples &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-to-help-you-poop-11757815" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bulks up stool&lt;/a&gt; to help push it through your system faster, helping you go more frequently.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no wrong way to enjoy apples. But for maximum fiber, leave the skin on. Then, chop them up and toss them into a high-fiber chia pudding or overnight oatmeal. Or simply pop one in your lunchbox to munch on.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; From top to bottom, your digestive system is one long, connected road. So, it’s not surprising that the foods you eat can ultimately affect your hemorrhoids. Fortunately, there are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-frozen-foods-to-help-you-poop-11733920" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;foods that can help prevent hemorrhoids&lt;/a&gt;, or help minimize pain and pressure down below if you already have them. Dietitians say the best foods to prevent hemorrhoids are kiwis, barley, popcorn, prune juice, lentils, flaxseed and apples. They’re rich in fiber and other compounds that have been shown to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7911394/the-fastest-way-to-relieve-constipation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;ease constipation&lt;/a&gt;, which is a major cause of hemorrhoids. For even more success, don’t forget to drink up, since fluids are key for keeping things lubricated and moving along smoothly. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For the best results, Simpson recommends a multipronged approach. “A well-balanced diet with the right fiber, hydration and daily motility support can reduce flare-ups, improve healing and help you stay off the hemorrhoid roller coaster,” she says.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message from the director, Susan Monarez, however, was delivered during an all-hands meeting that was brief and chaotic — it was expected to last one hour but closed after 13 minutes — leaving some agency employees marveling at what they saw as the inadequacy of the effort. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a mess,” one wrote to STAT. The meeting began late, and technical problems reportedly prevented some people from joining the call. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though staff were told Jim O’Neill, deputy secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, was on the call, O’Neill did not speak during the meeting. Likewise, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — who &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/12/kennedy-hhs-multiple-issues-rising-anxiety/"&gt;many on staff blame for inciting anger against the agency&lt;/a&gt; because of his criticism of vaccines and denigration of public health workers before he took the reins at HHS — was not present.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy toured the campus on Monday, a day staff were told to work from home. He has been criticized for posting &lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1954188966367723917" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;photos of a salmon fishing outing&lt;/a&gt; in Alaska to his personal social media account on X on Saturday, before &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1955042536680001704" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;he expressed condolences&lt;/a&gt; for the police officer who was killed in Friday’s attack and concern for the CDC staff on his professional X account.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/12/cdc-shooting-staff-concerns-security-rhetoric-rfk-jr/"&gt;A series of CDC meetings were held Monday&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the attack and security concerns. But the meeting on Tuesday was the first agency-wide address to the CDC by Monarez, whose first week at the CDC was punctuated by the attack. She told staff that the CDC Foundation has begun a fundraising effort for the family of the officer who was killed, David Rose of the DeKalb County Police Department.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In her brief remarks, Monarez alluded to the political debates that have made the once-storied CDC an object of hatred and distrust for some in the country, calling the incident “an attack on our community … and in many ways the very mission we serve.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We know that misinformation can be dangerous,” she said. “Not only to health, but those that trust us and those we want to trust. And we need to rebuild that trust together.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In moments like this, we must meet the challenges with rational evidence-based discourse spoken with compassion and understanding. That is how we will lead,” Monarez said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CDC’s acting chief operating officer, Christa Capozzola, was supposed to address the meeting but was unable to do so because of technical issues. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The event did not give agency employees an opportunity to vent anger or frustrations. A CDC source told STAT the chat function on the platform used to broadcast the meeting had been disabled. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A gunman who reportedly blamed a Covid vaccination for chronic health problems fired 180 rounds of ammunition at the CDC from a pharmacy across the street. Jeff Williams, director of the CDC’s office of safety, security, and asset management, told staff the shooter struck six different buildings on the campus with at least 150 bullets, shattering windows and terrifying employees. Those employees were forced to shelter in place for hours Friday night as security swept every room on the sprawling campus to determine if the gunman was acting alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The gunman, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot, has been identified as Patrick Joseph White, a 30-year-old from Kennesaw, an Atlanta suburb about 25 miles northwest of CDC headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some CDC staff have told STAT they did not receive the agency’s security alert on Friday and only learned of the incident because of a blaring siren emanating from nearby Emory University, or an email alert that Emory distributed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/09/cdc-gunman-security-disinformation-rfk-jr/"&gt;In a call on Saturday&lt;/a&gt; with the staff of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases — the group where CDC’s vaccines research and policy is housed — a number of employees expressed concern about how the response was conducted and their general safety. One woman, fighting back tears, suggested she and her colleagues felt like “sitting ducks.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The all-hands meeting had been scheduled before Friday’s attack and was to be an opportunity for Monarez to introduce herself and her vision for the agency to the CDC. “This is not the all-staff meeting I wanted to have,” she acknowledged as she opened her remarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

In 2021, the recommended age to start colorectal cancer screening in the US – either by colonoscopy or at-home testing – was &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/research/acs-research-highlights/colon-and-rectal-cancer-research-highlights/screening---early-detection-colorectal-cancer-studies/people-45-49-not-getting-screened-for-colorectal-cancer.html#:~:text=The%20decision%20was%20based%20on,colorectal%20cancer%20at%20age%2045." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;lowered&lt;/a&gt; from 50 to 45.

Experts say some people don’t know they should be getting screened, and others are nervous about what colonoscopies entail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Here’s what you need to know about colonoscopies and colorectal cancer screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-a-colonoscopy" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a colonoscopy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“A colonoscopy is an endoscopic procedure, meaning we use a camera at the end of a long tube to examine the colon and rectum,” explains Foda. The colon itself is about 70cm long, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Patients are first put under sedation or anesthesia. Doctors then insert the scope into their rectum, and examine the lining of the colon for any abnormalities, like masses or small bumps called polyps. These polyps are usually removed during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The closest analogy is, you have a mole on your skin and it’s growing or discolored, and doctors remove it,” says Michael Sapienza, CEO of the Colorectal &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Alliance, a colorectal cancer advocacy group in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If a mass is too big to remove during the colonoscopy, the doctor will take a sample to biopsy and test for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A colonoscopy is an outpatient procedure, meaning you can go home the same day. The procedure itself usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes, but with pre- and post-procedure care, the whole process can last two to three hours, says Dr Andres Carrion, a gastroenterologist at GastroMed Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of the most common concerns about colonoscopies is that they are painful, says Carrion. But “intravenous sedatives make the procedure easy, and there is no pain or discomfort”, he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-prepare-for-a-colonoscopy" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you prepare for a colonoscopy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Colonoscopy preparation starts about a week before the procedure. Patients are instructed to eat a “low residue” diet for that week, which means avoiding foods that can make it difficult for doctors to get a good look at the lining of the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“These are things that the body takes a while to get rid of, like seeds, nuts, leafy greens and high fiber things,” says Foda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The day before the procedure, patients are restricted to a clear liquid diet – no solid foods. And the night before, they take laxatives to fully clear the colon. This can result in spending quite a bit of time on the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Hopefully you have some good reading or a movie you can watch on your phone,” says Sapienza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-risks-of-a-colonoscopy" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the risks of a colonoscopy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Colonoscopies are generally extremely safe, but as with any medical procedure, there are risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/are-colonoscopies-safe" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, these include an adverse reaction to the sedative or anaesthetic used, dehydration from the preparation process, slight bleeding after a polyp is removed or mass biopsied, some abdominal pain, infection and a perforated bowel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This last risk is serious, but rare. One &lt;a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(18)30022-2/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; found that there were four bowel perforations for every 10,000 colonoscopies performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-23" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Depending on a person’s health and medical history, doctors may decide that colonoscopies could do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For those with a first-degree family member – meaning a parent, sibling or child – diagnosed with colorectal cancer, Carrion says screening should start 10 years before the age at which your relative was diagnosed. For example, if your mother was diagnosed with colon cancer when she was 45, you should start getting screened at 35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Certain medical histories also put individuals at a higher risk for colorectal cancer, says Foda. This includes those who have previously had cancer and have received chemotherapy, those with inflammatory bowel disease, as well as those with Lynch syndrome (a condition that increases an individual’s risk for many kinds of cancer) and polyposis (a condition characterized by a large number of polyps in the colon).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="are-there-other-methods-of-colorectal-cancer-screening" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there other methods of colorectal cancer screening?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Colonoscopies are not the only way to screen for colorectal cancer. For those at an average risk of the disease, there are also non-invasive at-home tests like Cologuard and the fecal immunochemical test (FIT), says Sapienza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For both tests, a patient will receive the necessary testing material in the mail or from a doctor. They will then have to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;mail in a personal fecal sample. The FIT analyzes whether there is blood in the stool. The Cologuard test looks for both blood in the stool and abnormal DNA that could point to polyps or masses in the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props="{&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;scriptUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;alt&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, 'Well Actually', then 'Read more on living a good life in a complex world,' then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say 'More from this section' &amp;quot;,&amp;quot;format&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;design&amp;quot;:10,&amp;quot;display&amp;quot;:0,&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;:4},&amp;quot;elementId&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;e57ca313-1ebf-41d3-a061-35650a7e82e0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;isMainMedia&amp;quot;:false}"&gt;&lt;figure id="e57ca313-1ebf-41d3-a061-35650a7e82e0" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, 'Well Actually', then 'Read more on living a good life in a complex world,' then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say 'More from this section' " data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20'Well%20Actually',%20then%20'Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,'%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20'More%20from%20this%20section'%C2%A0" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, 'Well Actually', then 'Read more on living a good life in a complex world,' then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say 'More from this section' &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-often-should-you-be-screened-for-colorectal-cancer" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How often should you be screened for colorectal cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The frequency for each person depends on a number of factors including the type of test performed and medical history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If a colonoscopy is completely clear, you can usually wait 10 years before your next procedure, says Sapienza, but check with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Current guidance recommends that FIT tests be repeated every year, and Cologuard every three years, says Sapienza. If the test is negative, no further analysis is required. If either test comes back positive, you will have to have a colonoscopy. This does not mean the at-home tests are not effective at detecting the disease alone, says Foda. “They should be viewed as part of the gold standard for colorectal cancer screening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-symptoms-of-colorectal-cancer" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the symptoms of colorectal cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In addition to regular screenings, be familiar with possible symptoms of colorectal cancer, says Sapienza. This is especially important for those under 45, who might not be eligible yet for screenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These symptoms include blood in the stool, especially dark blood; a change in bowel habits; anemia; involuntary weight loss; and/or ongoing stomach discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you start to present with any of these symptoms, talk to your primary care doctor or gastroenterologist, and ask for a colonoscopy, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We need to make sure that people are aware of these symptoms,” says Sapienza. “This is a disease where screening saves lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 16:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE5HVTItb1ZTNV94Nm5nS0lVWERLdDlLSWtOampTMFNySDg5ck1jbm5hMW9vdk5senNKTjhvY1pyYjBRWElDdHdUcXhKWFA4YUxOR1gybFBFSi1MU0ZtQTB1SXU5Q2RNZjhpZGZtWklQcVoxQkVVQUpFMUp3</guid></item><item><title>这种运动类型可以将痴呆风险降低88% - HuffPost UK</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxOR2VBU3h6QjNJU0pveDM3em1QQkV5Z0pnZlRwTnR1ZERsUzA5REczWVNRNkdFWnRkTEZ0VDhXNU1YVDhuRkJjaC1QOEZkWlh3WWZSb2pCa1Nobi0waFVXRWRVem1iWWhBNlhJUHJ2OVNtbWNacWVCcFpuM0ZTc0dkMS1xbkpEMVZoOURka053dEJBaXdxUW9aSkVZYUJ4aElaMUww0gGqAUFVX3lxTE4yZHpfQWdZTlZnT3NqLW5PVTJLQVI2aUo4Y0pUU1RWOFh4d3lCeTBWU09zMnVYN05IVUd0cFBtWXp3czFZbG1BRzYtMEY0RjRkLWVPSEdGOE9mSkduYkFxMUQ2Y1MtbkxUN3NFNmJVRlIzN21KQWF3al9JRHlFaFQtWlRRM3JRSDRXZFlCWDFqeHM1UVRoOTkzdU1FSmktcDhhdHh6cmxNT25n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is not only a &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/best-exercise-by-age_uk_677e5dcee4b018662a3b4fd0#:~:text=Low%2Dimpact%20cardio%2C%20like%20walking,in%20routines%2C%E2%80%9D%20Harris%20commented." role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="great way to fight back against sarcopenia " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689b2527e4b0c2e59a93c522" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="677e5dcee4b018662a3b4fd0" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;great way to fight back against sarcopenia &lt;/a&gt;(age-related muscle loss), but it has also been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/exercise-volume-prevent-dementia_uk_67bdca07e4b0d58740864887" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="decreased dementia risk" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689b2527e4b0c2e59a93c522" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="67bdca07e4b0d58740864887" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;decreased dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/taking-more-steps-a-day-might-reduce-dementia-risk#:~:text=Those%20who%20walked%20an%20average,Intensity%20offered%20extra%20protection." target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a 2022 paper found " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689b2527e4b0c2e59a93c522" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/taking-more-steps-a-day-might-reduce-dementia-risk#:~:text=Those%20who%20walked%20an%20average,Intensity%20offered%20extra%20protection." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;a 2022 paper found &lt;/a&gt;that just 3,800 steps a day may lower your likelihood of developing dementia by 25%, with increasing benefits up to 9,800 steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength training has been shown &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2020/02/11/strength-training-can-help-protect-the-brain-from-degeneration.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="to help protect the parts of the brain" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="689b2527e4b0c2e59a93c522" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2020/02/11/strength-training-can-help-protect-the-brain-from-degeneration.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;to help protect the parts of the brain&lt;/a&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;An experimental “off-the-shelf” vaccine for recurring pancreatic and colorectal cancer is showing great promise so far. Early results show that the vaccine appears to be safe and is potentially prolonging people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, and elsewhere are developing the vaccine, called ELI-002. In Phase I trial data released this week, people who received ELI-002 often developed an immune response to a specific type of cancer-linked mutation and lived longer than expected. The team has since launched a larger Phase II trial of the vaccine platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If this result can be confirmed in large randomized clinical trials, this could be utilized in 90% of pancreatic cancers and 50% of colon cancers who have this mutation,” lead study author Zev Wainberg, co-director of the Gastrointestinal Oncology program at UCLA, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/breast-cancer-vaccine-university-washington-her2-1850100926"&gt;Cancer vaccines&lt;/a&gt; are generally therapeutic, designed to improve our body’s natural ability to stop cancer from returning. ELI-002 is a peptide-based vaccine that tries to train our immune system’s T cells to go after cells containing a mutated KRAS gene. KRAS mutations often fuel the growth of cancerous cells, and they’re commonly found in many solid tumor cancers (up to 25%), particularly pancreatic and colorectal cancers. Unlike vaccines that have to be tuned to a person’s specific cancer, ELI-002 is intended to work against a majority of KRAS-containing cancers right from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In this latest trial, the researchers tested out a version of ELI-002 (ELI-002 2P) on 25 patients: 20 with pancreatic cancer and 5 with colorectal cancer. The patients had undergone standard treatment but continued to have residual cancer cells lingering in their blood, raising the risk of future recurrence. All were given six doses of ELI-002, aimed at their lymph nodes, while half received booster shots as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 85% of people generated an immune response to the two mutated KRAS proteins targeted by the vaccine, with two-thirds having a strong response. 67% of people also developed an immune response to other KRAS proteins, suggesting the vaccine further amplified their immunity to these mutations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, people with pancreatic cancer vaccinated with ELI-002 2P survived for 29 months and lived free of cancer recurrence for 15 months on average—better than the average survival and recurrence-free length historically seen with similar cases, according to the researchers. And those with the strongest immune responses fared even better. The team’s findings were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03876-4"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Monday in Nature Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Phase I trials aren’t intended to conclusively show that an experimental drug or vaccine works, so the findings should still be viewed with some caution until more data is collected. But it certainly looks like we’re on the verge of a breakthrough with cancer vaccines. Several candidates have shown &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/modernas-off-the-shelf-cancer-vaccine-shows-promise-in-early-human-trial-data-2000499098"&gt;similarly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/three-years-after-experimental-vaccine-these-patients-are-still-cancer-free-2000559585"&gt;encouraging&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/breast-cancer-vaccine-university-washington-her2-1850100926"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; in human trials, and the first of these newest vaccines could reach the public within the next few years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For their part, Wainberg and his colleagues have already completed enrollment of a Phase II trial for ELI-002, with results expected in 2026. This trial will test an updated version of the vaccine (named ELI-002 7P) that will hopefully cover an even broader array of KRAS mutations.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Recent generations of AI have proven handy for restaurant recommendations and writing emails, but as a source of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/more-people-are-risking-medical-advice-from-chatbots-heres-why"&gt;medical advice&lt;/a&gt; they've had some clear drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case in point: a man who followed a chatbot's health plan ended up in hospital after giving himself a rare form of toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story began when the patient decided to improve his health by reducing his intake of salt, or sodium chloride. To find a substitute, he did what so many other people do nowadays: he asked ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ai-ghosts-could-be-a-serious-threat-to-mental-health-expert-warns"&gt;AI 'Ghosts' Could Be a Serious Threat to Mental Health, Expert Warns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI's chatbot apparently suggested &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_bromide"&gt;sodium bromide&lt;/a&gt;, which the man ordered online and incorporated into his diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is true that sodium bromide can be a substitute for sodium chloride, that's usually if you're trying to clean a hot tub, not to make your fries tastier. But the AI neglected to mention this &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chatgpt-5-surprising-truths-about-how-ai-chatbots-actually-work"&gt;crucial context&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three months later, the patient presented to the emergency department with paranoid delusions, believing his neighbor was trying to poison him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the first 24 hours of admission, he expressed increasing paranoia and auditory and visual hallucinations, which, after attempting to escape, resulted in an involuntary psychiatric hold for grave disability," the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1260"&gt;physicians write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After he was treated with anti-psychosis drugs, the man calmed down enough to explain his AI-inspired dietary regime. This information, along with his test results, allowed the medical staff to diagnose him with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromism"&gt;bromism&lt;/a&gt;, a toxic accumulation of bromide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bromide levels are typically &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jat/22.3.225"&gt;less than around 10 mg/L&lt;/a&gt; in most healthy individuals; this patient's levels were measured at 1,700 mg/L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bromism was a relatively common condition in the early 20th century, and is estimated to have once been responsible for up to 8 percent of psychiatric admissions. But cases of the condition drastically dropped in the 1970s and 1980s, after medications containing bromides began to be phased out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170999" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170999" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Bromo_seltzer_newspaper-642x313.png" alt="Man Hospitalized With Psychiatric Symptoms After Following AI Medical Advice" class="wp-image-170999 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Bromo_seltzer_newspaper-642x313.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Bromo_seltzer_newspaper-600x292.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Bromo_seltzer_newspaper.png 739w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170999" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Bromide salts were once common, over-the-counter medications.

Some locals in Colorado noted seeing the same rabbits in their neighborhood dating back to 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Susan Mansfield told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/fort-collins-rabbits-virus/73-a3afc465-4296-4f2b-8491-023d10295661"&gt;KUSA&lt;/a&gt;: 'It looks like it was black quills or black toothpicks sticking out all around his or her mouth.

The first signs of SPV would be raised red spots on the skin (Stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For pet owners fearing their rabbits could contract the virus, medical experts said the best way to prevent SPV is to keep rabbits away from pests, especially mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If an insect bite does infect a pet rabbit with the virus, veterinarians can surgically remove the tumors before they become malignant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Occasionally, these growths will heal on their own; however, the residents in Fort Collins have only seen the horns get bigger and bigger on local wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some commenters on social media questioned whether it was better to euthanize any rabbits seen carrying SPV to prevent the virus from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Is it more humane to kill them when [they're] like that or just leave them alone?' one person posted on Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Animal control officials in the US have not made any kind of recommendation supporting this, adding that the virus does not pose a public health risk to people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Local wildlife officials have maintained that the best thing to do if you see these disfigured rabbits is to keep your distance and leave them undisturbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings add to evidence that early signs of MS may &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2025/05/29/clinical-tools-able-help-detect-early-subtle-symptom-ms-study/"&gt;go unnoticed&lt;/a&gt; for many years. Detecting these warning signs could aid an earlier diagnosis and start of treatment, when it’s likely to be most effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings dramatically shift the timeline for when these early warning signs are thought to begin, potentially opening the door to opportunities for earlier detection and intervention,” Helen Tremlett, PhD, a professor of neurology at UBC and study leader, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1093158"&gt;university press release&lt;/a&gt;. The study, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2837128"&gt;Health Care Use Before Multiple Sclerosis Symptom Onset&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MS occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/myelin-sheath/"&gt;myelin sheath&lt;/a&gt; on nerve fibers, causing a range of &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. While not all patients experience MS in the same way, many first notice vague symptoms such as excessive fatigue, anxiety, and depression years before a &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; is made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“MS can be difficult to recognize as many of the earliest signs — like fatigue, headache, pain and mental health concerns — can be quite general and easily mistaken for other conditions,” said Tremlett, who’s also a researcher at the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Increasing use of healthcare services&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s known that people who develop MS begin using healthcare services more before their first symptoms appear, most studies have focused on the five to 10 years before the onset of overt MS symptoms. Tremlett’s team looked at data stretching back 25 years, drawing on medical records from 2,038 people with MS whose healthcare use was compared to that of more than 10,000 people without MS. The groups were matched by age, sex, and where they lived, the goal being to see if those who later developed MS had used healthcare services differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patients were an average age of 37.9 at the time of the onset of their MS symptoms, and they visited a doctor more often starting 14 years before their symptoms began. These visits increased steadily, reaching their highest point in the year before the onset of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visits for general or “ill-defined” symptoms — for example, fatigue, dizziness, or feeling unwell without a clear diagnosis — were more common starting 15 years before the onset of symptoms. Visits related to mental health problems such as anxiety and depression were more frequent in the 14 years before symptoms, and visits to psychiatrists began as early as 12 years before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These patterns suggest that MS has a long and complex prodromal phase — where something is happening beneath the surface, but hasn’t yet declared itself as MS,” said Marta Ruiz-Algueró, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at UBC and the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visits to neurologists and ophthalmologists became more frequent in the last eight to nine years. In the year before symptoms appeared, neurologist visits were more than five times as high for people who went on to develop MS compared with those who didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that MS may begin much earlier than previously recognized, with mental health-related issues as early indicators, highlighting opportunities for earlier identification and intervention,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found why common cuff-based blood pressure readings are inaccurate and how they might be improved, which could improve health outcomes for patients.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;High blood pressure, or hypertension, is the top risk factor for premature death, associated with heart disease, strokes and heart attacks. However, inaccuracies in the most common form of blood pressure measurement mean that as many as 30% of cases of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/high+blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; could be missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, from the University of Cambridge, built an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/experimental+model/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;experimental model&lt;/a&gt; that explained the physics behind these inaccuracies and provided a better understanding of the mechanics of cuff-based blood pressure readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that some straightforward changes, which don't necessarily involve replacing standard cuff-based measurement, could lead to more accurate blood pressure readings and better results for patients. Their &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf222" target="_blank"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; are reported in the journal &lt;i&gt;PNAS Nexus&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has ever had their blood pressure taken will be familiar with the cuff-based method. This type of measurement, also known as the auscultatory method, relies on inflating a cuff around the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/upper+arm/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;upper arm&lt;/a&gt; to the point where it cuts off &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+flow/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood flow&lt;/a&gt; to the lower arm, and then a clinician listens for tapping sounds in the arm through a stethoscope while the cuff is slowly deflated.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Blood pressure is inferred from readings taken from a pressure gauge attached to the deflating cuff. Blood pressure is given as two separate numbers: a maximum (systolic) and a minimum (diastolic) pressure. A blood pressure reading of 120/80 is considered "ideal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The auscultatory method is the gold standard, but it overestimates diastolic pressure, while systolic pressure is underestimated," said co-author Kate Bassil from Cambridge's Department of Engineering. "We have a good understanding of why diastolic pressure is overestimated, but why systolic pressure is underestimated has been a bit of a mystery."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Pretty much every clinician knows blood pressure readings are sometimes wrong, but no one could explain why they are being underestimated—there's a real gap in understanding," said co-author Professor Anurag Agarwal, also from Cambridge's Department of Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous non-clinical studies into measurement inaccuracy used rubber tubes that did not fully replicate how arteries collapse under cuff pressure, which masked the underestimation effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers built a simplified physical model to isolate and study the effects of downstream blood pressure—the blood pressure in the part of the arm below the cuff. When the cuff is inflated and blood flow to the lower arm is cut off, it creates a very low downstream pressure. By reproducing this condition in their experimental rig, they determined this &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/pressure+difference/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pressure difference&lt;/a&gt; causes the artery to stay closed for longer while the cuff deflates, delaying the reopening and leading to an underestimation of blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+mechanism/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical mechanism&lt;/a&gt;—the delayed reopening due to low downstream pressure—is the likely cause of underestimation, a previously unidentified factor. "We are currently not adjusting for this error when diagnosing or prescribing treatments, which has been estimated to lead to as many as 30% of cases of systolic hypertension being missed," said Bassil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of the rubber tubes used in earlier physical models of arteries, the Cambridge researchers used tubes that lay flat when deflated and fully closed when the cuff pressure is inflated, the key condition for reproducing the low downstream pressure observed in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that there are a range of potential solutions to this underestimation, which include raising the arm in advance of measurement, potentially producing a predictable downstream pressure and therefore a predictable underestimation. This change doesn't require new devices, just a modified protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You might not even need new devices, just changing how the measurement is done could make it more accurate," said Agarwal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if new devices for monitoring blood pressure are developed, they might ask for additional inputs which correlate with downstream pressure, to adjust what the "ideal" readings might be for each individual. These may include age, BMI, or tissue characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers are hoping to secure funding for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; to test their findings in patients, and are looking for industrial or research partners to help refine their calibration models and validate the effect in diverse populations. Collaboration with clinicians will also be essential to implement changes to clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;

Source for data: Cancer Research UK &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This process triggered the lesions and ultimately cancer itself, the researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also discovered they could stop pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions from forming in the pancreas—by disabling a specific gene called CREB, which plays a pro-inflammatory role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found CREB acts like a 'master controller', capable of permanently reprogramming healthy pancreas cells into abnormal, pre-cancerous cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This paves the way for pancreatic cancer to develop.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Study co-author Dr Nipun Merchant, a surgeon in Miami, said that they believe their findings 'lay the groundwork' for future pancreatic cancer prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The discovery comes amid a troubling rise in pancreatic cancer cases among younger people—although there has not yet been a spike in deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease has a grim prognosis, with around 10 per cent of patients surviving the first year after diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By three years, the survival rate drops to around one per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly types, and kills roughly 90 percent of its victims, and has a survival rate after five years of around two percent or less&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pancreatic cancer has been dubbed a 'silent killer' due to its subtle signs that are often only spotted too late&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fewer than one in 20 pancreatic cancer patients live to see the decade after their diagnosis, according to UK figures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, it is incredibly important to catch the illness in its early stages by recognising the easy to dismiss symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include weight loss, fatigue, abdominal pain and changes in bowl habits and jaundice—the yellowing of the skin or eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pancreatic cancer is an umbrella term for various tumours found on the 25cm tadpole shaped organ that helps with digestion and hormone regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common type which is called adenocarcinoma accounts for roughly 90 per cent of cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This variant has little-to-no symptoms until patients start suddenly losing weight and turn yellow and at which point for the vast majority, it is too late. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is for this reason the heartbreaking disease has been dubbed a 'silent killer'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the surge in cases has come from another type of pancreatic cancer, called endocrine cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These are slow growing tumours which take decades to emerge, and while they may turn cancerous, are mostly benign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some experts suspect that cancer isn't appearing more often in young people, but there are better tools today to diagnosis it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They put the surge down to an increased use of high-tech medical scans like CT and MRIs which have grown more sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the National Health Service (NHS) those more likely to get cancer are over 65s and those who have chronic pancreatitis or a family history of the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other risk factors include smoking, being overweight or obese, diabetes, eating red and processed meat as well as blood group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I was just poking around to find a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/best-meditation-apps/" target="_self"&gt;good meditation&lt;/a&gt; to start my day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;I've used Headspace on and off over the years, but this time, something caught my eye: a tab labeled "Care." Out of curiosity, I tapped on it, which led me to a part of Headspace where I could access &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/best-online-therapy/" target="_self"&gt;professional help&lt;/a&gt;. There, I could book sessions with a life coach or a licensed therapist directly within the app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had been a year since I last had therapy, mostly because I hadn't yet found a trusted provider since moving to New York. As someone who's tested almost every &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/best-mental-health-apps/" target="_self"&gt;therapy app&lt;/a&gt; out there, I wasn't sure I'd be impressed. Could a meditation app offer meaningful therapy, or would it be another wellness upsell?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of now, I've had six sessions with my therapist through the Headspace app, plus some homework and self-reflection. Here's what I found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="toc-0a9acaf9-4dbc-48f1-b6ae-b8af7572d861-item-1" data-id="toc-0a9acaf9-4dbc-48f1-b6ae-b8af7572d861-item-1"&gt;How Therapy by Headspace works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Headspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headspace's therapy feature is built within the app, so you don't need a new login or an upgrade to your subscription. Just tap the "Care" tab, choose your availability and therapist, and you're ready to book your &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/first-therapy-session-guide-documents-questions-and-goals-to-prepare/" target="_self"&gt;first session&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few key things to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Therapy is billed per session. I pay $30 per appointment using my Cigna insurance. Pricing will vary depending on your provider and coverage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You'll be prompted to enter your insurance information prior to booking. You'll only be charged after your session.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sessions are 45 minutes, and you can usually book your first one within a few days. Your therapist will determine the frequency. I see mine weekly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The cancellation window is 48 hours before your appointment. If you cancel within this window, you will be charged $125.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is no matching done by algorithms or jumping to a third-party platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="toc-0a9acaf9-4dbc-48f1-b6ae-b8af7572d861-item-2" data-id="toc-0a9acaf9-4dbc-48f1-b6ae-b8af7572d861-item-2"&gt;You choose the therapist who's right for you&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I like about Headspace that sets it apart from platforms like BetterHelp or Talkspace is that you're not matched with a provider based on an algorithm. You can choose who you want to work with based on location, availability and areas of specialty, such as &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/7-free-ways-to-ease-depression/" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, trauma, relationships and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/soothe-your-anxiety-without-medication-9-tricks-to-try/" target="_self"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_adLeftRail stickyAd sticky-ad-check c-adDisplay_container_native-mpu-middle blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Headspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each therapist profile includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A photo of them and their name (I used this info to look up more on them through Google)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Specialties and therapeutic approaches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A short bio with some background information&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can't message therapists before booking, which may be a downside for some. Typically, therapists offer a free consultation call so you can get to know them before you decide if they're the right choice for you. However, the profiles (and my Google search) gave me enough information to feel confident in my choice. I found a therapist who aligned with my values and my desire to incorporate spirituality (without religion) into my care. And she made sure to remember that detail every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your first match isn't quite right, you can request a new therapist through the Member Support team. They'll help you find someone who's a better fit, at no extra cost. Be sure to initiate this process or cancel pre-booked sessions with your therapist at least 48 hours in advance to avoid late cancellation fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="toc-0a9acaf9-4dbc-48f1-b6ae-b8af7572d861-item-3" data-id="toc-0a9acaf9-4dbc-48f1-b6ae-b8af7572d861-item-3"&gt;What sessions can look like&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before your first appointment, you'll have an intake session and take a short mental health screening. The questions are designed to evaluate symptoms of depression and anxiety. Then, we discussed my goals and how I'd like to measure progress. It's important to note that every therapist will approach goals and success metrics differently. Be sure to discuss how you'd like to approach your treatment with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapy sessions occur over video within the Headspace mobile app or on your computer. To access them via your computer, you'll need to download Zoom and use the Zoom link provided in your confirmation email. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I love most about my sessions is how deep and intentional my therapist is. &lt;a href="https://www.zocdoc.com/professional/alexmi-polanco-lmhc-415555" rel="noopener nofollow sponsored" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Alexmi Polanco&lt;/a&gt; is warm and attentive and gives me homework each week. Homework includes writing letters to my inner child, practicing affirmations and outlining what my dream future self looks like. We've gone over childhood trauma, dismantled core beliefs that no longer serve me, and I even learned kind and loving ways to show up for myself each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Headspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="toc-0a9acaf9-4dbc-48f1-b6ae-b8af7572d861-item-4" data-id="toc-0a9acaf9-4dbc-48f1-b6ae-b8af7572d861-item-4"&gt;Integration with Headspace's mental wellness tools is a game changer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes Headspace shine is how well the therapy feature integrates into Headspace's ecosystem. Between sessions, I use meditation and mindfulness tools from within the app to help reinforce what we're working on. Some other features I've explored are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;CBT-based courses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/5-beginner-breathing-exercises-that-will-help-banish-stress/" target="_self"&gt;Guided breathwork&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journaling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sleepcasts and music&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/i-tried-an-ai-companion-to-help-me-process-my-emotions-and-found-it-helpful/" target="_self"&gt;Ebb&lt;/a&gt;, an AI chatbot designed to help you regulate emotions in real time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="toc-0a9acaf9-4dbc-48f1-b6ae-b8af7572d861-item-5" data-id="toc-0a9acaf9-4dbc-48f1-b6ae-b8af7572d861-item-5"&gt;Headspace Therapy Care pros and cons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many things I love about Headspace, but every app comes with some drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pros:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can select the therapist you'd like to see (based on location and availability)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Affordable with insurance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seamless integration with Headspace resources&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-quality video and audio&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In-app booking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sessions felt deeply personalized&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Switching therapists is easy, at no extra cost&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No client dashboard to track sessions, goals or leave notes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No pre- or post-session messaging with your therapist (I was able to message her via email)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High late-cancellation fee of $125&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="toc-0a9acaf9-4dbc-48f1-b6ae-b8af7572d861-item-6" data-id="toc-0a9acaf9-4dbc-48f1-b6ae-b8af7572d861-item-6"&gt;Headspace Therapy Care is better for some people &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This online therapy service is an excellent fit if you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are dealing with anxiety, depression or stress&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prefer a gentle, mindfulness-based therapy approach&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Already use and enjoy Headspace content&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Want an online therapy service that integrates with other self-care tools&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's not ideal for people who:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_adLeftRail stickyAd sticky-ad-check c-adDisplay_container_native-mpu-middle blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Need or prefer in-person therapy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Want 24/7 access or daily therapist messaging&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are in crisis or require higher-level clinical support&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="toc-0a9acaf9-4dbc-48f1-b6ae-b8af7572d861-item-7" data-id="toc-0a9acaf9-4dbc-48f1-b6ae-b8af7572d861-item-7"&gt;How Headspace compares to BetterHelp and Talkspace&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapy by Headspace feels more personalized and less transactional than other apps I've tested, like &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/betterhelp-online-therapy-review/" target="_self"&gt;BetterHelp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/talkspace-online-therapy-review/" target="_self"&gt;Talkspace&lt;/a&gt;. The latter two platforms may offer broader networks, daily messaging and more tracking tools, but they feel very corporate in tone, and I prefer Headspace's quality of therapists and care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headspace feels a lot warmer and deeply reflective.

The remediation of the 11 towers required by the health department has been completed, according to a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2025/nyc-health-provides-second-legionnaires-cluster-update.page" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Monday update;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Monday update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The following ZIP codes and bordering communities have been affected in Harlem: 10027, 10030, 10035, 10037 and 10039.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Anyone in these ZIP codes with flu-like symptoms should contact a health care provider as soon as possible,"&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2025/nyc-health-provides-second-legionnaires-cluster-update.page" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said acting health commissioner;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; said acting health commissioner&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Michelle Morse.

    &lt;p&gt;With its mild flavor and high water content, zucchini may not seem like a nutritional standout. But this summer fruit (yes, it’s a fruit) can help lower inflammation, support clearer vision and promote metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at all that zucchini has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; It contains powerful antioxidants. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For centuries, zucchini has been used in traditional medicine because of its anti-inflammatory, antiviral and antimicrobial properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, scientists link these benefits to the antioxidants in zucchini, including vitamin C, beta carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin, which help protect cells from free radical damage and enhance immune function. Half a medium zucchini contains about 15 milligrams of vitamin C, which is nearly 20% of the daily recommended amount for adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin are also carotenoids, pigments that give zucchini its bright green skin. Carotenoids can help regulate the production of inflammatory cytokines, said Taylor Wallace, a food scientist and adjunct clinical associate professor at George Washington University. Cytokines act as chemical messengers in the immune system, signaling cells to respond to infection or injury. At healthy levels, cytokines keep us from getting sick, but too many or too few can drive excess inflammation and lead to diseases like cancer, Wallace explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While dark, leafy greens and berries are richer in carotenoids and other antioxidants, zucchini’s advantage lies in its versatility. It can be prepared in all sorts of ways, and its mild taste makes it an easy filler or substitute ingredient (think “zoodles”) that packs a nutritional punch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zucchini may not be a particularly “glamorous vegetable,” but it’s inexpensive to buy and easy to grow yourself, added Christopher Gardner, the director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; It’s good for your vision. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lutein and zeaxanthin are essential for eye health. They build up in a part of the eye called the macula and help protect eye cells from damage. Over time, these nutrients can help keep vision sharp and stave off age-related macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of blindness in older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One cup of zucchini contains a little over 2 milligrams of lutein and zeaxanthin, which is about 17% of what experts recommend daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; It can help keep blood pressure in check. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the cells in your body to function properly, two minerals need to stay in balance: potassium and sodium. Unfortunately, “almost no one” gets enough potassium, Wallace said. And almost everyone gets too much sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium is key to managing blood pressure and offsetting the effects of too much sodium, said Maya Vadiveloo, a dietitian and associate professor of nutrition at the University of Rhode Island. Half a medium zucchini contains about 4% of the recommended daily amount, which is similar to what you’d find in half a banana. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Zucchini fills you up, but it isn’t calorie-dense. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to being 95% water, zucchini is low in sugar, calories and fat. Research suggests that energy density — the number of calories per unit of food weight — shapes how much we eat, how satiated we feel and our long-term health. The lower the calories-to-volume ratio, the better. Regularly eating water-rich, lower-energy-density foods can help you feel full and curb the risk of chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bulking up your plate with zucchini or other nonstarchy vegetables is a great way to reduce how much you’re eating without feeling like you’re depriving yourself,” Vadiveloo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What’s the best way to eat zucchini? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any form — raw, grilled, puréed, roasted, sautéed, spiralized — is healthy, experts said, though there are a few things to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t peel zucchini’s verdant skin, because it’s packed with nutrients. Heat can degrade some important compounds, like vitamin C. And the lutein and zeaxanthin in zucchini are fat-soluble, so they’re best absorbed with a little olive oil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, this cancer is diagnosed by specialists using invasive procedures like video nasal endoscopy and biopsies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-voice-could-hide-the-tell-tale-signs-of-parkinsons-disease"&gt;Your Voice Could Hide The Tell-Tale Signs of Parkinson's Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital screening tools that detect the early warning signs of laryngeal cancer using voice recordings could help non-specialist doctors identify patients at risk, and help them receive a diagnosis sooner than they might otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analyzing 12,523 voice recordings from 306 North American participants, researchers from Oregon Health and Science University and Portland State University identified in men the telltale vocal features of vocal fold lesions that were either benign or cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, the harmonic-to-noise ratio (the relationship between tone and noise) helped to differentiate between male voices with cancer, benign lesions, and voice disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were unable to find  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/p-value" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73101" data-postid="170955" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;statistically significant&lt;/a&gt; identifying features in women's voices in this study, but are hopeful that a wider dataset could offer better results for female voices in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170969" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170969" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/laryngeal-cancer.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-170969" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/laryngeal-cancer.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/laryngeal-cancer-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/laryngeal-cancer-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170969" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Laryngeal cancer symptoms include voice changes like hoarseness, and a sore throat that won't go away.

Building on our findings, I estimate that with larger datasets and clinical validation, similar tools to detect vocal fold lesions might enter pilot testing in the next couple of years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2025.1609811"&gt;Frontiers in Digital Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

out a post-mortem brain examination on 25 cats which had symptoms of dementia in life, including confusion, sleep disruption and an increase in vocalisation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0

Meanwhile, vaccine exemptions reached a record high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These statistics became all the more disturbing last fall when, shortly after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/health/child-vaccinations-decline-cdc.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;286,000 children&lt;/a&gt; began their educations without proof of full immunity against measles, a man who has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/us/politics/trump-anti-vax.html#:~:text=A%20long%20and%20complicated%20history%20with%20vaccines&amp;amp;text=In%202007%2C%20she%20wrote%2C%20he,happened%20to%20take%20the%20vaccine.%E2%80%9D" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;bragged about never getting a flu shot&lt;/a&gt; was re-elected to the presidency.

In doing so, they risk endangering millions of people and kickstarting a doom loop of mistrust from which it could take decades to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As usual, the Trump administration’s stance on vaccines is motivated less by sincere populism and more by personal profit. Before Kennedy launched his own presidential campaign on a platform of “making America healthy again”, he earned &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/12/03/rfk-jr-maha-pay-vaccine-group-childrens-health-defense/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$20,000 every week&lt;/a&gt; helming a non-profit dedicated to fostering vaccine skepticism. Now in the cabinet, he has fired the entire &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/09/rfk-jr-to-fire-all-members-of-the-cdcs-vaccine-advisory-committee-00395235" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC vaccine advisory panel&lt;/a&gt; and replaced them with a ragtag crew, half of whom have &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/members-rfk-jr-s-new-vaccine-committee-have-published-little-vaccines" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;never published peer-reviewed research&lt;/a&gt; on vaccines. Just last week, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/nx-s1-5493550/rfk-jr-funding-mrna-vaccine-development" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cancelled $500m of federal funding&lt;/a&gt; for mRNA vaccines, which &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9537923/#:~:text=They%20determined%20the%20number%20of,COVID%E2%80%9019%20in%20a%20year." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;prevented 14m deaths&lt;/a&gt; during the Covid-19 pandemic. And he has made these rollbacks while &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-confirmation-robert-f-kennedy-merck/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;retaining a financial stake&lt;/a&gt; in ongoing litigation against a vaccine manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All the while, the US has seen more than &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;1,300 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; and three deaths this year. In response, Kennedy has alternately &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5354900/hhs-rfk-endorses-mmr-measles-vaccine-stoking-supporters-fury" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;endorsed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;undermined&lt;/a&gt; the most effective method of prevention – widespread immunization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The evisceration of funding has extended across the sciences, with Trump cutting support for research to a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/22/upshot/nsf-grants-trump-cuts.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;35-year nadir&lt;/a&gt;. At the National Institutes of Health, &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/5437295-nih-broke-law-by-withholding-funding-gao/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;1,800 grants&lt;/a&gt; have been terminated, a move that the Government Accountability Office &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/us/politics/trump-gao-nih-funding.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;deemed illegal&lt;/a&gt;. The administration also continues to freeze grants to universities over culture war phantasms like DEI, including &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-05/ucla-negotiate-nih-nsf-doe-grant-cuts" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$339m at UCLA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/trump-administration-freezes-2-2-billion-in-grants-to-harvard/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$2.2bn at Harvard&lt;/a&gt;. So it’s not surprising that &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/5218404-scientists-poll-leaving-us-poll/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;75% of US scientists&lt;/a&gt; polled by the journal Nature are considering leaving the country, which raises the prospect of a lost generation of American talent and lifesaving innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Internationally, Trump’s heartless and thoughtless budget cuts are causing devastation. The administration &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/usaid-programs-now-run-state-department-agency-ends/story?id=123373289" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;has dismantled USAID,&lt;/a&gt; one of the most successful preventers of contagious disease in history. In doing so, it defunded programs that &lt;a href="https://ge.usembassy.gov/usaid-and-vaccines-helping-save-9-3-million-children-in-the-last-10-years/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;vaccinated more than 800 million children&lt;/a&gt; against fatal illnesses like malaria. Researchers have found that &lt;a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/media/som/news/news-logos/BU-researcher-warns-of-367,000-deaths-from-halted-USAID-programs_.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;300,000 people have already died&lt;/a&gt; because of these cuts, which could lead to another &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/07/01/nx-s1-5452513/trump-usaid-foreign-aid-deaths" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;14m preventable deaths&lt;/a&gt; over the next five years – all to gut an agency that managed the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/usaid-cuts-lead-14-million-deaths-five-years-researchers-say-rcna216095" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;equivalent&lt;/a&gt; of 4% of &lt;a href="https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/fy24_ndaa_conference_executive_summary1.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the annual national defense budget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Back in the US, medical associations, local officials and individual doctors are &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/24/vaccines-access-rfk-cdc/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;collaborating to buy vaccines&lt;/a&gt; directly from manufacturers and lobbying insurance companies to continue covering the costs of those shots. Their efforts reflect a tried-and-true strategy to counter under-immunization. Before the current outbreak, Ronald Reagan-era cuts to public health caused &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/05/13/722944146/how-public-health-outreach-ended-a-1990s-measles-outbreak-and-whats-different-no" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a more widespread measles pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, with 27,000 cases in just 1990. But locally led outreach campaigns and grassroots vaccination programs turned back the crisis, as did an eventual restoration of federal funds under Bill Clinton’s administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Budget cuts can be reversed, but trust may be more difficult to recover. Long before RFK Jr’s ascendancy, disasters like the CDC’s infamous &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/about/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Untreated Syphilis Study at Tuskegee&lt;/a&gt; and the Food and Drug Administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.12.1.226" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;glacial response to the Aids crisis&lt;/a&gt; cast long shadows over public health institutions. Today, a plurality of Americans &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/poll-many-americans-say-they-will-lose-trust-in-public-health-recommendations-under-federal-leadership-changes/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;are already predicting&lt;/a&gt; they will lose faith in medical guidance under the current administration. That would undermine the very basis of public health, which depends on people choosing to follow guidelines grounded in research they did not personally conduct and whose results they are ill-trained to parse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Repairing that breach will require years of effortful relationship-building, but it might also require rallying Americans with the classic tactic of patriotism. For all of Trump’s bellicose rhetoric, he misses that our nation’s most extraordinary scientific and medical advances have drawn bipartisan enthusiasm in part because they reinforced a perceived American exceptionalism. At the height of the cold war, RFK Jr’s uncle &lt;a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/we-choose-go-moon-jfks-moon-shot" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;chose to go to the moon&lt;/a&gt;, and Richard Nixon &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/history/55-years-ago-president-nixon-establishes-space-task-group-to-chart-post-apollo-plans/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;brought that dream to fulfilment&lt;/a&gt;. After Franklin Delano Roosevelt founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, Americans helped fund it by &lt;a href="https://time.com/5062520/march-of-dimes-history/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;mailing in more than 2.5m dimes&lt;/a&gt;, hence its christening as the March of Dimes. That money supported Jonas Salk’s development of the polio vaccine. Within two years of its introduction, annual cases of polio had &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/history-of-polio-vaccination" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fallen by 90%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even Trump, who &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/29/opinions/ways-trump-botched-covid-response-holtgrave" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;botched the initial response&lt;/a&gt; to Covid-19, managed to oversee &lt;a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/article/2309561/trump-administration-collaborates-with-moderna-to-produce-100-million-doses-of/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the historic Operation Warp Speed&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h2 class="AlignCenter"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;$4,000,000.00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that ain’t chump change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you'd like to add to the total for the four chosen groups—the World Central Kitchen, AmeriCares, Nova Ukraine, and Razom for Ukraine—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/dkukraine" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;click here and ActBlue will help you take care of the rest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Many thanks—they need the help now more than ever, especially with Putin’s puppet back in office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and one more quick thing for Mr. Putin: I noticed that you&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; haven’t included me on your&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-bans-state-department-miller-200-persons/32861738.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;list&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;of Americans banned from Russia. You really should. When you wake up tomorrow and look under your covers you’ll know why. (It’s very fresh and comes courtesy of a very good dog.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And now, our feature presentation...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


          &lt;p class="story-intro-divider"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheers and Jeers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, August 12, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today is National Middle Child's Day.  Everybody say the official motto with me: &lt;em&gt;"Oh, Marcia Marcia Marcia!!!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;By the Numbers:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;4 days!!!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Days 'til Labor Day: &lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Days 'til the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bristolharborfest.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bristol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Harbor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Festival &amp;amp; Blessing of the Fleet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Estimated inflation rate when new numbers come out today, according to Bank of America and Goldman Sachs: &lt;strong&gt;3.1%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Amount stolen from low-income households by the EPA after it canceled grants for solar power projects that were approved by the Biden administration and Congress: &lt;strong&gt;$7 billion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Percent chance that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Germany&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is now openly criticizing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Israel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; for acting too Holocaust-ish against the Gazans: &lt;strong&gt;100%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Estimated age of the meteorite fragments that fell through a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Georgia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; man's roof in June and left a big dent in his floor: &lt;strong&gt;4.56 billion years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Age of Apollo 13 astronaut Jim Lovell when he died Friday: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;97&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Puppy Pic of the Day:&lt;/strong&gt; And the 2025 winner of the World's Ugliest Dog Contest is…&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/pets/worlds-ugliest-dog-winner-2025-rcna223932" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not that ugly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JEERS &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;to another dumb week. Since I'm both "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;America&lt;/span&gt;'s Sweetheart" and "&lt;span&gt;America&lt;/span&gt;'s Most Trusted News Source," it's up to me to keep you informed on what the current brain-dead zombie clown running Planet Earth is up to these days. I'll keep it brief:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;❀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  He's meeting with puppetmaster Putin in Alaska on Friday. Also: he's all over the Justice Department's files pertaining to the pedophile sex trafficking ring of Jeffrey Epstein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;❀ &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;He's tackling the most pressing issue in &lt;span&gt;Washington&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;D.C.&lt;/span&gt;: sending in troops to deal with the horror of our nation's capital having the lowest crime rate in 30 years. Also: he's still ordering his inner circle to make the Epstein pedophilia scandal go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;❀&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; He's redecorating the White House and its grounds in fake gold that will be immediately removed by his successor. Also: the MAGA universe is growing increasingly hostile towards him for his massive, administration-wide cover-up of the Epstein scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us tomorrow for our next brain-dead zombie clown update, sponsored by He Knew Exactly What Epstein Was Doing And Did Nothing About It miracle stain non-remover. (Now available in a refreshing ketchup scent.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHEERS &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;to today's Tariffs Update. I'm late for my Pilates class disruption-related activities, so just a quick moment to toss out the latest Republican tariffs and what they mean:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tariff 1:&lt;/strong&gt; 45%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it Means: &lt;/strong&gt;You'll be paying 45% more for items from these countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tariff &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;2:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; 15&lt;/span&gt;%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it Means: &lt;/strong&gt;You'll be paying 15% more for items from these countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tariff &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;3:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; 50&lt;/span&gt;%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it Means: &lt;/strong&gt;You'll be paying 50% more for items from these countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tariff 4:&lt;/strong&gt; 0%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What it Means: &lt;/strong&gt;You lucky bastard, you won’t have to pay anything extra to have—[&lt;em&gt;checks notes&lt;/em&gt;]—deliveries of fish guts from this country dumped on your lawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figures. Trump always did like that country with all the fish guts best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHEERS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;to compassionate conservatism.  70 years ago today, on&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;August 12, 1955&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, that liberal fringe kook President Dwight Eisenhower raised the hourly minimum wage from 75¢ to a dollar.  Or, as Republicans today would call it: "a dollar too much."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BRIEF SANITY BREAK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;END BRIEF SANITY BREAK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;CHEERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;to great advances in libationology.  136 years ago this week, in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;1889&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Dan Rylands patented the screw cap for bottles. Our rule: if it doesn’t curl your nose hairs when you twist it off and sniff it, send it back to the bartender.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHEERS &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;to cool science. Exciting news to share in the world of the dreaded "c-word." Sounds like researchers are getting close to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/pancreatic-cancer-vaccine-prevents-recurrence-phase-1-clinical-trial-rcna223980" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;winning the war&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; against one of the most insidious cancers:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an early trial, a one-size-fits-all vaccine showed promise in preventing hard-to-treat pancreatic cancers from coming back. &lt;span&gt;Pancreatic cancer is of particular concern. The five-year survival rate is about 13%, and up to 80% of pancreatic cancers may come back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image-captioned align-right"&gt;&lt;img alt="FILE - In this Wednesday, March 11, 2020 file photo, a technician prepares COVID-19 coronavirus patient samples for testing at a laboratory in New York's Long Island. Confidence in the scientific community declined among U.S. adults in 2022, a major survey shows, driven by a a partisan divide that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic.

(AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Medical research is such a vial industry.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vaccine targets one of the most common genetic drivers of cancer: KRAS gene mutations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;KRAS mutations occur in about one-quarter of all cancers, including as much as 90%of pancreatic cancers and about 40% of colorectal cancers. Their ubiquity makes KRAS mutations a great target for cancer therapies, but the mutations have long been considered impossible to target with drugs. To accomplish this, the vaccine uses short chains of amino acids called peptides that teach immune cells to recognize and attack&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;cells with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;KRAS mutations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctors say three things have to happen in order to roll out the new vaccine: expand the testing, modify the serum for maximum effectiveness and, most important, make sure that RFK Jr. never gets near it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ten years ago in C&amp;amp;J: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 12, 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;JEERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to the sanctity of marriage.  Taking my cue from the right-wingers, who are still in the throes of their post-Supreme-Court-ruling hissy fit, I shall now &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/12/us/newlyweds-are-accused-of-planning-to-join-isis.html?_r=0" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cherry-pick a story&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that proves heterosexuals are sullying the institution and should be banned from it:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A newlywed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mississippi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; couple who were arrested on the way to the airport for a trip to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Syria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to join the Islamic State were ordered held without bail on Tuesday.  The couple, Jaelyn Delshaun Young, 19, and Muhammad Oda Dakhlalla, 22, were on their way to the airport in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Columbus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Miss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, on Saturday when they were arrested by F.B.I. agents after unwittingly making travel plans with undercover federal agents on social media that included discussing a trip to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Syria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; via &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greece&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Turkey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; as a honeymoon ruse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sickos. And God only knows what they do in bed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And just one more…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JEERS &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;to the silence of the modems. It was a nightly ritual back in the day. After supper was supped and the dishes were washed, we'd disconnect the phone and hook the line up to our 45-pound laptop. What happened next will &lt;em&gt;shock &lt;/em&gt;you: through the miracle of technical innovation and a loud screeching noise, we would "log on" to AOL and explore the shiny new universe known as the World Wide Web. It was our introduction to such cultural icons as the dancing hamsters, the dancing baby, and the dancing wheel that told us our signal was "buffering." And now that nightly experience is about to officially become little more than &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/aol-ditching-dial-service-relic-internet-90s-early-00s-rcna224219" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;misty watercolor memories of the way we surfed:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the hazy impressions of memory, some may even recall it fondly: The AOL dial-up internet service that those of a certain age associate with the World Wide Web is coming to a close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="align-center"&gt;
&lt;figure class="image-captioned"&gt;&lt;img alt="aol.jpg" src="https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/303375/large/aol.jpg?1474727184" title="aol.jpg"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Enjoy your Social Security, Running AOL Man.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company, also known by its "You've got mail" greeting and the CD trial discs—so many CDs—made the announcement on its website. […]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AOL, now part of Yahoo, said the dial-up service, along with the AOL Dialer software and AOL Shield browser, will be discontinued on Sept. 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to us old timers. We drove the internet's Model T and lived to tell the tale. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go watch six streaming services simultaneously, sort through my 50,000-song iTunes playlist, and finish using my AI programs to write the next great American novel. Just as soon as the pop-up ads stop freezing my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have a tolerable Tuesday. Floor's open...What are you cheering and jeering about today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today's Shameless C&amp;amp;J Testimonial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The deeper reality is that &lt;em&gt;Cheers and Jeers&lt;/em&gt;, as the portal to the digital metasphere, has rewired how an entire generation thinks, feels, and relates to the world. There’s no undo button."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The owner of the dog then expertly reversed their vehicle before calling the dog back. The wolf was then able to continue on its path and swim across the Yellowstone River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Commenters were quick to blame the owner, but the author of the post pointed out another issue: the countless people who ran in the direction of the wolf. While the owner should take responsibility for the dog's escape, mistakes do happen, but members of the public should know better than to approach a dangerous animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/safety.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National park guidelines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National park guidelines&lt;/a&gt; state that people should keep at least 100 yards away from dangerous animals such as wolves and bears.

      &lt;p&gt;Eleanor Ceres found out she had lung cancer after the tumor spread from her chest and began protruding out her neck.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Born and raised in Cape Town, South Africa, Ceres has been smoking for over 30 years — and smoking causes &lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21834" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nearly three-quarters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of lung cancer deaths around the world.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Why wasn't she diagnosed earlier? Prior to the tumor's manifestation, her only symptom had been a sore arm, which the doctors chalked up to arthritis. By the time she was diagnosed in April 2024, the cancer had advanced to Stage 4 and was terminal. Doctors could only offer palliative care, easing her pain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I've got a child around 12 years old. I want to see her grow up and get married and have her own children," says Ceres, a single mother. "I cry a lot because I'm gonna die and everybody's gonna stay alive."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The story of Ceres holds clues to a puzzling issue involving lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's the deadliest cancer &lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21834" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in the world&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, killing 1.8 million people each year — more than any other cancer. But the official statistics suggest that isn't the case in sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, based on mortality rates, it seems that lung cancer is only a problem in South Africa — the &lt;a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPD@WEO/AFQ/DZA/ZAF/MAR/NGA/EGY?year=2019" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;richest country&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the region — and, in particular, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1877782117301637?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Western Cape&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — the province with the &lt;a href="https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/western-cape/state-of-sa-hospitals-western-cape-has-most-efficient-health-care-in-country-but-fears-grow-of-deterioration-5239603c-6698-400c-9d53-44f8ce144dca" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most efficient&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(02)11820-4/fulltext#:~:text=The%20Western%20Cape%20has%20had,proportion%20than%20any%20other%20province." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;well-resourced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; health care system.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But experts say these statistics hide the real story: how lung cancer is being grossly undercounted across sub-Saharan Africa. While smoking is slightly higher in &lt;a href="https://africa.businessinsider.com/local/lifestyle/top-10-african-countries-that-have-the-most-smokers/dl63tzv" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;South Africa&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; compared to its neighbors, that's only half the story, according to Dr. Coenie Koegelenberg, a pulmonologist at Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town. "We have the most accurate stats because we actually diagnose lung cancer," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-77205" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Africa's hidden lung cancer epidemic, as Koegelenberg calls it, is part of a larger crisis in global health, as infectious diseases like tuberculosis and HIV have increasingly &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30925-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;come under control&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) become an existential threat.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.35458" target="_blank"&gt;Africa's cancer burden, for example, is expected to more than double by 2050&lt;/a&gt;, from 370,000 new cases a year to 940,000 cases. However, &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/272534/WHO-NMH-NVI-18.8-eng.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;only 1%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of global health funding is allocated to preventing and treating NCDs in low- and middle-income countries, despite accounting for two-third of annual deaths.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lung cancer offers a case study for how these countries can succeed or fail in addressing NCDs, given that this disease can usually be prevented through smoking cessation or even &lt;a href="https://press.rsna.org/timssnet/media/pressreleases/14_pr_target.cfm?ID=2380" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cured&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with regular screening and early treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Instead, systemic undercounting and resource constraints have allowed the disease to grow unchecked across sub-Saharan Africa. "If you don't report things and put your head in the sand, that doesn't mean it's not there," Koegelenberg says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why lung cancer goes undiagnosed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are almost no nerve endings in the lungs, so in the early stages, the most common symptom of lung cancer is no symptom at all, says Dr. Keertan Dheda, a pulmonologist at Groote Schuur Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And when symptoms do appear, they are often quite generic — chest pain, coughing up blood, and difficulty breathing. So, doctors in sub-Saharan Africa often misdiagnose lung cancer patients as having tuberculosis, given the &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/tuberculosis-tb" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;high burden&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the region, Dheda continues.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Patients would go through the whole treatment regimen for tuberculosis and not really be investigated for lung cancer," says Lorraine Govender, a nurse and the national manager of health promotion at The Cancer Association of South Africa. Those lost six to nine months of possible treatment can be deadly, since &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/lung-cancer/survival" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;55% of people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with lung cancer die within a year, according to Cancer Research UK "The lack of training for health care providers to identify lung cancer is a big problem," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis may play an even more direct role, given that patients with this disease are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8836400/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;twice as likely&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to get lung cancer than those without — likely due to this bacterial disease causing lung inflammation and DNA damage.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;HIV is also implicated in lung cancer since this virus weakens patients' immune systems, leaving them less able to fend off respiratory diseases or kill budding cancer cells, according to Koegelenberg. His own research shows that, among &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27384354/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lung cancer patients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, those with HIV tend to be younger and have more advanced cancer than those without HIV. "Lung cancer is but one spoke in the wheel of colliding epidemics," Koegelenberg says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Given these challenges, many lung cancer patients die misdiagnosed, and their real cause of death is rarely known, given poor infrastructure to certify deaths and their causes. "In Africa, where we don't have the screening and diagnosis available, we may see deaths from cancer but not know what cancer the patient actually died from," Govender says, "or maybe have deaths and not know it was cancer."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Autopsies could help answer these questions but are rarely performed for religious and cultural reasons, says Dr. Kelechi Okonta, a cardiothoracic surgeon at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital in Nigeria. The World Health Organization thus assessed that &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/news/whats-cause-certifying-deaths-sub-saharan-africa" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;two-thirds of countries&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Africa don't have reliable data on births, deaths, and cause of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Okonta thinks sub-Saharan Africa is in a catch-22 on lung cancer, where systemic undercounting leads to limited data and limited data allows governments to ignore this disease and the need for better record-keeping. "There is no intentional activity by any government at any level. There is no lung cancer registry, there is no lung cancer group, there is no lung research grant, there is no lung cancer unit, even in the hospitals," says Okonta. "They think it's not a problem."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The other side of the problem is timely diagnosis. While the Western Cape and South Africa lead the region in spotting lung cancer, for most patients, it comes too late. Data from the largest hospital in the Western Cape showed that, in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9250306/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;94%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of patients with lung cancer had advanced, incurable disease at the time of diagnosis. There's always an ethical dilemma around asking someone with advanced lung cancer to stop smoking, says Dr. Ayanda Trevor Mnguni, head of the department of internal medicine at Khayelitsha District Hospital in South Africa and a pulmonologist. "Once you are actually so far gone, there's really no point."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-77206" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Dr. Ayanda Trevor Mnguni is the head of internal medicine at Khayelitsha District Hospital, where he treats lung cancer patients. He says that the diagnosis almost always comes so late in the progression of the cancer that only palliative care can be offered to relieve pain.

Especially &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4382920/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;at risk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are communities like Khayelitsha, a racially segregated township on the outskirts of Cape Town, as tobacco companies often flood poor areas with cheap cigarettes and aggressive marketing. It's a sprawling maze of makeshift homes — of cardboard, wood and corrugated metal — over &lt;a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/new-york/manhattan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;twice&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sikhulasonke.org.za/about-khayelitsha.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;as dense&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as Manhattan, with an estimated &lt;a href="https://borgenproject.org/life-inside-worlds-largest-slums/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2.4 million residents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;At Khayelitsha District Hospital, patients in blue gowns regularly step outside to have a smoke. Mbulelo Shicani, a lung cancer patient here, says that he buys a pack of cigarettes for 10 rand, or 50 cents, and that these prices have actually been &lt;a href="https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/tobaccocontrol/29/Suppl_4/s267.full.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;coming down&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Local shop owners also never turn away customers since they're too young, Shicani continues.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We obviously diagnose lung cancer a lot better compared to the rest of the country and the rest of the continent," Mnguni says, given that the Western Cape has the strongest health care system in South Africa and perhaps all of sub-Saharan Africa. "But that doesn't mean much if smoking rates continue to rise," he says, and the disease is almost always so advanced that the only option is palliative care.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; and lung cancer patients only receive palliative care upon diagnosis" — For those in Khayelitsha, they're almost always facing such advanced disease that "we don't even refer them to the oncologist," Mnguni says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why screening isn't an easy solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One way to find tumors and treat them early is with &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6790462/#" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lung cancer screening&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, especially given that &lt;a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/07/23/2024/africa-big-pharma-push-cancer-early-detection" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pharmaceutical companies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, such as AstraZeneca and Chinese firm BGI Genomics, see Africa as a key region for innovation and investment. So, in 2019, Koegelenberg and Dheda created the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6790462/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;first lung cancer screening guidelines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in sub-Saharan Africa, and Discovery, the largest private health-insurance provider in South Africa, started covering screening several months ago, Koegelenberg says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That, however, would only serve South Africa's private health care system, which caters to a small, wealthier minority with far greater resources. Dheda openly acknowledges that lung cancer screening isn't practical for the &lt;a href="https://www.thepresidency.gov.za/node/8149" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;84% of South Africans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the public system, or even most other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, "although we should be screening and we know we should be screening," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even if there were enough CT scanners to screen high-risk individuals, there wouldn't be capacity to biopsy nodules and treat all these cases, given budget shortfalls and rapidly growing waitlists. "It's unethical to do the scan if there's an abnormality, and you actually can't do anything about it," says Dr. Sameera Dalvie, an oncologist at Groote Schuur Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The only option, as Mnguni sees it, is public health awareness with comprehensive anti-smoking campaigns and regulations. He points out that Shicani and most people in Khayelitsha don't know that smoking can lead to lung cancer, so governments shouldn't take awareness for granted. "Once people end up with cancer, unfortunately, you're not going to do well," Mnguni says. "For most limited resource countries, the best bet is to prevent people from getting the disease."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This too is easier said than done, given &lt;a href="https://www.iol.co.za/ios/news/tobacco-dealers-cry-foul-over-anti-smoking-bill-6c93f37e-ef45-44e7-aa1d-226f68f54f6a" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pressure from tobacco companies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the need for greater social support to help people manage addiction. "Many people view smoking as a coping mechanism," says Salomé Meyer, one of the leaders of South Africa's Cancer Alliance. "What are you going to offer in the place of smoking when communities are living in stress?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change may be on the way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, Meyer is hopeful about the future. South African lawmakers are &lt;a href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/government/824494/new-smoking-laws-for-south-africa/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;considering a&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.medicalbrief.co.za/new-smoking-vaping-bill-proposes-20-year-sentences/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new smoking law&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that would ban all tobacco and e-cigarette advertising, as well as raise penalties to 15 years of jail time for businesses that sell tobacco to children or at cut-rate low prices. Furthermore, recent research from Vietnam suggests that lung cancer screening might be feasible with &lt;a href="https://www.jto.org/article/S1556-0864(23)01169-3/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chest x-rays and artificial intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a more realistic, scalable option for sub-Saharan Africa, Koegelenberg says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, change hinges on better data collection, from comprehensive cancer registries to a universal death registration system, Okonta says. And that might have to be proactively driven by the healthcare system instead of the government — in order to break the catch-22. "With adequate record keeping and follow-up of patients, we can solve this," Okonta adds. "Maybe the government will start paying attention to lung cancer."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We must stop hiding behind, 'Oh, it's not going to be affordable,'" Meyer says, since the cost of inaction is far too high. "We must just do it."&lt;/p&gt;

Their findings, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12024-024-00903-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Forensic Science, Medicine and Pathology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, suggest that dyes like methylene blue and toluidine blue, as well as medications or consumer products containing warning colors, tend to produce distinct discoloration patterns in the body. These color changes may offer clues about medical interventions or substance exposure prior to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study emerged from an autopsy of a 72-year-old man, where the forensic team noticed that some organs began to darken into a striking blue-green hue shortly after exposure to air. This prompted a systematic review of similar cases, both in their own institutional records and in the existing literature, to determine the cause and possible diagnostic relevance of such unusual color changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forensic pathologists are trained to identify and interpret a wide range of tissue abnormalities. Changes in the color of organs during autopsy are often linked to common causes such as decomposition or bleeding. But in some rare cases, the source of discoloration is not immediately clear. The case that initiated this study involved a rapid and unexpected shift in organ color, specifically in the brain and heart, prompting questions about whether a chemical or pharmaceutical compound might have caused the effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that subtle findings—like organ color shifts—can be easy to miss or misinterpret, particularly if they are rare or not well documented. In this case, the absence of obvious decomposition, combined with the pattern of discoloration and the rapid intensification of the color during the procedure, pointed to a more specific etiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore potential causes, the team reviewed a database of over 15,000 autopsy records from their institution, looking for keywords such as “blue-green,” “turquoise,” and “greenish” in descriptions of organ appearances. This search returned eleven relevant cases, including the initial index case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined the full autopsy reports for each case and, when possible, reviewed the patients’ hospital records. They also conducted a targeted literature review to identify reports of similar discolorations linked to known drugs or toxic substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of the eleven cases, nine involved deaths that occurred in a hospital setting. Medical records were available for most of these patients, allowing the researchers to reconstruct the medical interventions and medications given before death. In six of the hospital cases, methylene blue had been administered intravenously. In two others, toluidine blue had been used. In the remaining cases, the discoloration was likely due to the ingestion of substances containing food-grade dyes or other pigments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methylene blue is a synthetic dye that has been used in medicine for over a century. It is commonly employed as a diagnostic stain during surgeries to visualize structures like the urinary tract or gastrointestinal lining. Clinically, it is also used as an antidote for conditions such as methemoglobinemia, where it helps restore the blood’s ability to carry oxygen. In intensive care settings, methylene blue may be given to treat circulatory shock that does not respond to other medications, as it can help improve blood pressure by affecting blood vessel tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toluidine blue, another synthetic dye, is primarily used in medical imaging and tissue staining. It selectively binds to acidic cellular components like DNA and RNA, making it useful for identifying abnormal or precancerous cells during endoscopic examinations or biopsies. Although less commonly used than methylene blue, toluidine blue has similar staining properties and is occasionally employed when methylene blue is unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the cases reviewed, a consistent pattern emerged: discoloration tended to affect specific organs depending on the substance involved and the route of exposure. When methylene blue had been administered intravenously, the discoloration was most often seen in the brain and heart. In contrast, oral ingestion of dyes or dyed substances was more likely to produce localized staining in the gastrointestinal tract or urinary bladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the original case, the 72-year-old man had received toluidine blue both orally and intravenously during treatment for a perforated duodenal ulcer and subsequent septic shock. After death, the autopsy revealed a rapidly darkening blue-green tint in the brain, heart, and mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another case, a 30-year-old man with severe COVID-19 and necrotizing pancreatitis had received methylene blue as part of his treatment for circulatory shock. Upon autopsy, his brain and heart exhibited the same dark blue-green tint shortly after being exposed to air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar discoloration pattern was seen in other cases where methylene blue had been used, reinforcing the idea that this dye, or its oxidized form, is responsible for the color change. The researchers explained that methylene blue circulates in a reduced form within the body but oxidizes upon contact with atmospheric oxygen after death, intensifying the blue-green appearance during autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to medically administered dyes, the team also identified two cases in which the discoloration could be traced to the ingestion of Rohypnol®, a drug that includes a blue dye to deter misuse. In both cases, the individuals had consumed large quantities of the drug in apparent suicide attempts, and blue-green staining was found in the stomach lining and intestinal tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another case involved a woman who had ingested a cleaning product containing Brilliant Blue FCF (a synthetic dye used in food and industrial products). In her case, the urinary bladder lining exhibited the same striking coloration, likely due to excretion of the dye through the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings align with a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12024-020-00316-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2020 case report&lt;/a&gt;, also published in &lt;em&gt;Forensic Science, Medicine and Pathology&lt;/em&gt;, which described a similar discoloration of the brain and heart in a 63-year-old woman who had been treated with methylene blue for septic shock. That report noted a greenish-blue hue in the affected organs, which intensified upon air exposure, consistent with the oxidation of the compound. The authors of that report highlighted the importance of distinguishing such findings from other causes of discoloration, such as decomposition or toxic gas exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study builds on those observations by identifying a larger set of similar cases, offering a clearer understanding of the substances that tend to produce these effects and the specific tissues they affect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers were able to associate discoloration patterns with specific xenobiotics, their conclusions were based primarily on visual observations and review of medical records. Due to the retrospective nature of the study, tissue samples were not always available for histological or toxicological confirmation of methylene blue or toluidine blue residues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conventional histology, the dyes often degrade or are no longer visible, limiting the ability to confirm their presence postmortem. More sophisticated testing could provide chemical verification, but such analyses were beyond the scope of this review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights the rarity of systemic toluidine blue administration, which may explain why its effects have not been previously documented in forensic contexts. As this dye is sometimes used as a substitute for methylene blue during shortages, awareness of its potential for postmortem discoloration may become more important in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the authors suggest that forensic teams should consider the possibility of xenobiotic exposure when encountering unexplained blue-green discolorations during autopsy. Integrating clinical history, medication records, and targeted toxicology testing can help avoid unnecessary speculation or misdiagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12024-024-00903-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Fifty shades of green and blue: autopsy findings after administration of xenobiotics&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by J.

			&lt;p&gt;Scientists may have identified a way to naturally regulate blood sugar levels and sugar cravings in a similar fashion to drugs like Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice and humans, the key to unlocking this natural process was found to be a gut microbe and its metabolites – the compounds it produces during digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By increasing the abundance of this one gut microbe in diabetic mice, researchers led by a team at Jiangnan University in China &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01902-8"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; they can "orchestrate the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-reveals-a-drug-free-way-to-mimic-the-effects-of-ozempic"&gt;Expert Reveals a Drug-Free Way to Mimic The Effects of Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormone that is naturally produced by the body and which helps regulate blood sugar levels and feelings of fullness. GLP-1's release is stimulated by certain foods and gut microbes, and its mechanism of action is mimicked by drugs like semaglutide (the ingredient behind Ozempic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="171046" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; typically have impaired GLP-1 function, leading to issues with blood sugar control, which is why &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-protein-discovery-could-rival-ozempic-with-fewer-side-effects"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and other GLP-1 agonists work as treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These drugs mimic natural processes in the body, and while they have proved very effective, some researchers want to figure out how to get the body to produce more GLP-1 on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A growing body of research has revealed that our cravings for dietary components originate from signals sent from the gut, a key organ in transmitting dietary preferences," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01902-8"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; the authors in their paper published in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, which genes, gut flora, and metabolites in the gut microenvironment are involved in the regulation of sugar preference is currently unclear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research suggests gut microbes like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phocaeicola_vulgatus"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bacteroides vulgatus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and their metabolites may help shape a person's sweet tooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments, if mice could not produce a gut protein, called Ffar4, the researchers found the gut colonies of &lt;em&gt;B. vulgatus&lt;/em&gt; shrank.

But at what cost? Do you even know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no hard-and-fast numbers on how often people pee in the pool, but at least one &lt;a href="https://sachsmedia.com/healthy-pools-survey-results-2019/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="survey" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6895f267e4b001d68aee01fe" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://sachsmedia.com/healthy-pools-survey-results-2019/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; got 40% of American adults to admit to peeing in the pool. It doesn’t seem like they’re exaggerating: Older research published in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.estlett.7b00043" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology Letters" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6895f267e4b001d68aee01fe" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.estlett.7b00043" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology Letters&lt;/a&gt; analyzed water samples from 31 pools and hot tubs and discovered that a 220,000-gallon pool contained about 20 gallons of pee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, the odds of you swimming in pee this summer are high. While peeing in the pool is gross, is it really all that bad? What can happen if you or someone around you does this just once? In the name of science, we tapped a toxicologist, infectious disease physician and microbiologist to break it all down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens when you pee in a pool?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few things. The big issue is the interaction of urine with the chemicals in the pool. “When human urine combines with chemicals that are present in chlorinated swimming pools, potentially harmful compounds called disinfection byproducts, or DBPs, can form,” said &lt;a href="https://www.medstarhealth.org/doctors/kelly-krisna-johnson-arbor-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6895f267e4b001d68aee01fe" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.medstarhealth.org/doctors/kelly-krisna-johnson-arbor-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor,&lt;/a&gt; a toxicologist at MedStar Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Stefan Cristian Cioata via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Stefan Cristian Cioata via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The more organic matter in the pool, the more chloramines are produced (that includes pee, along with sweat and poop particles).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Urine naturally contains nitrogen-containing compounds like urea, ammonia and creatinine, Johnson-Arbor explained. “These nitrogen-rich compounds can react with chlorine or other disinfectants found in swimming pools to form DBPs that can cause harmful health effects.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chlorine specifically forms something called chloramines when it binds to human waste products (like pee) in the pool, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-swimming/toolkit/chloramines-and-pool-operation.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6895f267e4b001d68aee01fe" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-swimming/toolkit/chloramines-and-pool-operation.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. These chloramines can build up in the water and off-gas into the air. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This isn’t just a urine thing. “Chlorine interacts with many kinds of organic matter,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=tmelendy" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Thomas Melendy" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6895f267e4b001d68aee01fe" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=tmelendy" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thomas Melendy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, associate professor of microbiology and immunology, and biochemistry in the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University at Buffalo in New York. “The reason it’s put in pools is to act as an antibacterial and antiviral. It helps to keep the pool clean and noninfectious.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How big of a deal is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It depends on how you look at it. “From an infectious disease point of view, peeing in a well-chlorinated pool doesn’t really present a problem. That’s not to be confused with pooping in the pool, which does,” said &lt;a href="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=trusso" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Thomas Russo," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6895f267e4b001d68aee01fe" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=trusso" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Thomas Russo,&lt;/a&gt; professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo. While &lt;a href="https://www.europeanurology.com/article/S0302-2838%2815%2900206-7/abstract/-sterile-urine-and-the-presence-of-bacteria" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="urine isn’t sterile" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6895f267e4b001d68aee01fe" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.europeanurology.com/article/S0302-2838%2815%2900206-7/abstract/-sterile-urine-and-the-presence-of-bacteria" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;urine isn’t sterile&lt;/a&gt;, most people don’t carry major pathogens in their pee that chlorine can’t handle, Russo said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But chloramines can be an issue, according to Melendy. “Any time chlorine interacts with organic matter, it makes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; chloramines,” he said. “The more chloramines that are produced,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; the higher the risk of skin, eye and lung irritation.” (This can be a bigger problem in people with underlying respiratory issues such as asthma, he said.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If ventilation in an area isn’t great, chloramines that off-gas from the water will settle on the water’s surface, where they can cause symptoms, according to the CDC. One of those chloramines is trichloramine, a volatile chemical that evaporates easily into the air and causes that signature “chlorine” smell in swimming pools, Johnson-Arbor said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The more organic matter in th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;e pool, the more chloramines are produced, Melendy said. (That includes pee, along with sweat and poop particles.) This also inactivates the chlorine, he points out. “The more organic matter you introduce to the pool, the less effective chlorine is at being an antibacterial because it gets used up,” Melendy said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if you pee in a saltwater pool?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The impact is likely the same, Johnson-Arbor said. “Saltwater pools use &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35725075/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="electrochemically generated chlorine" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6895f267e4b001d68aee01fe" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35725075/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;electrochemically generated chlorine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; instead of liquid chlorine for disinfection,” Johnson-Arbor said. (Electrochemically generated chlorine happens after an electric current is passed through a concentrated salt solution.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Since this process still generates chlorine, any nitrogen-containing matter that is present in a saltwater pool can still combine with the chlorine to generate DBPs,” Johnson-Arbor said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if only one person pees in the pool?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you really have to go and there’s no bathroom nearby, it’s fair to wonder how much of an issue it will be if just one person pees in the pool. “It’s a matter of concentration,” Melendy said. “There’s so much chlorine and water in the pool. If just one pers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;on pees in a very large pool, it’s unli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;kely to create a significant irritant.” (However, he points out that sensitivity varies from person to person.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If it’s one person in a really small pool, it might have a significant impact,” Melendy said. “Conversely, if it’s a big pool and a lot of people are doing it, i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;t’s going to produce lots of chloramine gases. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a nuanced thing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Johnson-Arbor also pointed out that this isn’t just a urine issue. Sweat and poop particles inevitably slip off your skin and into the water, too. “In addition, if individuals do not shower before entering pools, their loose hairs and skin cells can transfer from their bodies into the pool, further contributing to development of DBPs,” Johnson-Arbor said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

From breakfast scrambles to rich desserts, its versatility makes it a culinary favorite. But beyond its taste and texture, new research suggests eggs may also be a powerful ally for your brain health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="more-49736"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="Eggs_a_nutritional_powerhouse"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eggs: a nutritional powerhouse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutritionally, eggs are hard to beat. A single egg delivers about 70 kilocalories, 7 grams of &lt;a href="https://chicagoaudible.com/mug-cake-proteine-chocolat/" data-type="post" data-id="49419"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;protein&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, healthy fats (saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated), and vitamin D. They are also an excellent source of choline, a nutrient vital for cell function and brain development. Studies have already linked eggs to cardiovascular health, eye protection, and weight management. Surprisingly, despite long-standing myths, recent findings also suggest eggs can help regulate blood cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="What_the_latest_study_reveals_about_the_brain"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the latest study reveals about the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 study published by the &lt;strong&gt;Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)&lt;/strong&gt; examined data from 890 people, including 531 women, to explore the relationship between egg consumption and cognitive performance. The results were striking: women who ate the most eggs showed slower memory decline, while men who consumed eggs regularly scored better in overall and long-term cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="Why_eggs_may_boost_cognitive_function"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why eggs may boost cognitive function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers point to eggs’ rich content of carotenoids and choline as key factors. These nutrients support the nervous system, enhance neurotransmitter function, and may improve cognitive abilities such as &lt;strong&gt;memory and focus&lt;/strong&gt;. However, the study also noted that certain benefits appeared to differ between men and women, and more research is needed to understand why these variations occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section" id="The_bottom_line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ez-toc-section-end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are more than just a breakfast staple — they may be a &lt;strong&gt;brain-boosting &lt;a href="https://chicagoaudible.com/this-is-the-worlds-healthiest-food-according-to-scientists/" data-type="post" data-id="49507"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that supports mental sharpness over time. Whether poached, scrambled, or boiled, including them as part of a balanced diet could help nourish not only your body but also your mind. And as science continues to uncover their full potential, one thing is clear: &lt;strong&gt;eggs deserve their reputation as a nutritional all-star&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Chicago Audible</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxNSGJZejRsMlNTSVdnWnc4Qm1xYzNfejcyMUdTZ2RmN2tKZ0RISERkSzNSZmYteXdGRkJfNnIzbTdyV2hnREE5WUpJdWFiRk9odXhsVklFbzd0cVJnTFE4a0YxNTV1Sm5Fb1JDYmp1MVJyTzdKblY0c0xTNU1RaU9qa1c0emdITERLQlQtSW1RY3NWREEtSDJxTUpQOENRUWlkSXRIMXY0ZEx3dURGY1JhQzdR</guid></item><item><title>维生素D过量：当善意变成有毒时- Medscape</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxQVzhldU1XRHVjWlRyQ1k1OWpkc0prUFg5VEVWUk5oVWs0YUxicm5yaFV5dGNuZF9RQ19GZVExb1hPUDI1WE1wOE5BMl9lRjJuUGRjQ1FJLWFSUVpodkF1VGlsM09laGZUYUJuN1R6ZnJ4bkFQeTZETU1rY3BCd1FTZGlFZDdEZ0tDUVMwQ0NIVGRuYUNvYTdwR1piOThIVlR0VEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__body-maincontent" id="article-body_2025a1000lbk"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption and bone health.

Clinical evaluation confirmed acute renal failure, hypercalcemia, and high serum vitamin D levels, prompting a public health investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities in Spain’s Balearic Islands reported that poisonings occurred in otherwise healthy individuals who had consumed multivitamin products purchased online without medical guidance or supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following these cases, the Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition (AESAN) &lt;a href="https://www.aesan.gob.es/AECOSAN/web/seguridad_alimentaria/alertas_alimentarias/2025_32.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;issued an initial&lt;/a&gt; public health alert. Although the distribution of the defective batch was initially confined to the Balearic Islands, AESAN noted that it might have been redistributed elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This case highlights the dangers of vitamin D intake without supervision. In 2019, the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices &lt;a href="https://www.aemps.gob.es/informa/notasInformativas/medicamentosUsoHumano/seguridad/2019/docs/NI_MUH_FV-2-2019-vitamina-D.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;warned that&lt;/a&gt; high-dose preparations could cause hypervitaminosis D after multiple cases were reported in adults and children through the Spanish Pharmacovigilance System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1695403325001754#bib0045" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin D overconsumption&lt;/a&gt; can occur at any age, a recent study reported an increase in pediatric cases. The authors noted that although such cases remain uncommon, reports have increased &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1695403325001754#bib0045" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;in recent years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent complications, the Ministry of Health urged the public and health professionals to use vitamin D prudently, based on evidence. This includes requesting diagnostic tests and prescribing supplements only when clinically indicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While vitamin D is essential for bone metabolism and calcium regulation, “supplements should only be prescribed when clinically justified. Unsupervised use, particularly when exceeding recommended doses, may lead to adverse effects and is not recommended without specific medical indication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2018/0215/p254.html#:~:text=enfermedades%20esquel%C3%A9ticas%20manifiestas.-,%C2%BFC%C3%B3mo%20se%20define%20la%20deficiencia%20de%20vitamina%20D?,adecuada%20a%20la%20vitamina%20D." rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;US National Academy of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; (formerly the Institute of Medicine), the recommended daily dietary intake of vitamin D is intended to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels that support overall health.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which produces them, said it was reviewing its advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;NICE recommends that monitoring, using blood tests and scans, should be offered to the lowest risk cases in England and Wales, where nine in 10 will have no signs of cancer spreading within five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But research has suggested this could be extended to the next lowest risk group where eight in 10 men will have no signs of cancer spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Evidence gathered by Prostate Cancer UK suggests many hospitals have started offering monitoring to this wider group of patients, but a quarter have not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;According to the analysis of data in England, this appears to have resulted in over-treatments rates of between 2% and 24% across different hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The charity estimates this results in around 5,000 men a year getting treatment they do not always need instead of monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some of this could be down to patient choice – men are generally given the option of treatment even if they are at low-risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But the charity said if the NHS was more active in offering monitoring it could help strengthen the case for prostate cancer screening, which has gained traction since the diagnosis of Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;One argument against screening is that the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/tests-and-treatments/psa-test/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test&lt;/a&gt;, used to spot potential signs of the cancer, is unreliable and leads to unnecessary treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Amy Rylance of Prostate Cancer UK, said: "To reduce the harm caused by prostate cancer and build the foundations for a screening programme, we need to both save lives and prevent unnecessary treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She said NICE needed to update its guidance to reflect the emerging evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;One patient who opted for monitoring was Michael Lewis, 63, from the West Midlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2020 and, as it was judged low-risk, he opted for monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Four years later tests suggested the cancer was worsening so he had his prostate removed. He said delaying treatment was so valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I was able to continue my everyday life with no side effects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;NICE said the organisation was reviewing the prostate cancer guidelines and looking to update them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We are committed to ensuring our guidelines continue to reflect the best available evidence and give patients the best possible outcomes," said a spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 10:43:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9hVzF0TUpQMkV1TWEzMVBhc21Rc0hYY2tsUkNtUGx3QUZJVGpRVGZzZEJneGt3bDc1elRPcVRCcEFjak5qSlNlLXphaHlaN2l4aGdEV0FNOGp2UdIBX0FVX3lxTE1OcjZFWUZDTElvTUJYN3lkX0ZOQzlSaVlBZ2xsTzV2MnpqQUNKOVgwNUFkS2N1U1kyeFRXSEJXY3pmSGdtUE1DeDRiQjI5WDBoS05UeV9FYnNpZHNKbnBv</guid></item><item><title>孤独的人倾向于将自己视为他人的负担- PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxOc2VZaUJiWUYtRHdIZHVMcE5TTzZWMVMzdTEzc1laVlhZeGM1N050S2FvZkpVaWs5V2NROE4zN3pvbE42ZUdLc0RJVHRrRzg3S21NNFNETTVmaFpQWTVqbVRwQUtQQzlaQ1dJdjYtcFhOS0ROamJVUER6TEw3Mk13S3BUWDdLbU9rYmZreGZzdGNYbnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70105" target="_blank"&gt;Psychophysiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; sheds light on how people experiencing loneliness tend to view their own contributions to relationships more negatively, particularly with family. The findings suggest that a person’s resting heart function — specifically high-frequency heart rate variability — might slightly buffer these self-critical perceptions, indicating a potential physiological mechanism that supports social resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness is often misunderstood as simply being alone. In reality, it refers to the subjective feeling that one’s social relationships are lacking in quality or quantity. A person can be surrounded by others and still feel lonely if those interactions do not feel meaningful. In contrast, social isolation is an objective state defined by having few social contacts, which may or may not be distressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness acts as a psychological alarm, signaling a perceived loss or threat to social connection. This feeling tends to ramp up attention to social cues, especially those signaling rejection or conflict. For some, this heightened sensitivity may help guide reconnection efforts. For others, however, it can spiral into withdrawal and further alienation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although loneliness has been consistently linked to poor mental and physical health, not everyone responds to it in the same way. Some people seem to navigate loneliness without falling into persistent patterns of distress. The researchers behind this study were interested in understanding what might explain this variability — particularly how people perceive their own social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Loneliness and social support are often looked at in terms of what a person receives from others, but we were curious whether, when people feel lonely, they also see themselves as giving less to their relationships. Could a negative perception of your own ability to engage in close relationships contribute to developing prolonged loneliness?” said Emily Kent, a teaching fellow in the social sciences at the University of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than focus on how lonely individuals judge others, this study explored how they judge themselves — especially their own tendency to be supportive or to cause strain in their close relationships. The researchers also investigated whether a biological marker of emotional flexibility, known as high-frequency heart rate variability, helps moderate these perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-frequency heart rate variability refers to the variation in time between heartbeats that is regulated by the parasympathetic branch of the nervous system. This system helps the body relax and maintain internal balance. Greater variability in this measure tends to indicate a stronger ability to adapt emotionally and socially. In past research, individuals with higher resting variability have shown better emotion regulation, stronger social skills, and greater resilience to stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from 824 participants in the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS) study, a long-running project tracking health and psychological outcomes in American adults. Participants had completed assessments of loneliness, and they also rated how much support or strain they believed they contributed to their relationships with friends and family. These assessments asked how often they felt they were helpful or burdensome to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, each participant also underwent a psychophysiological evaluation during which their resting heart rate variability was recorded using electrocardiography. The researchers focused on high-frequency heart rate variability, considered a specific measure of parasympathetic nervous system activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With this study, we were excited to explore the idea that loneliness might not just change how people feel about others, but also how they see what they offer socially,” Kent told PsyPost. “The MIDUS dataset gave us the opportunity to test that idea in a large, real-world sample and explore whether individual differences in physiological flexibility (HF‑HRV) might help buffer those effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis indicated that individuals who reported greater feelings of loneliness also tended to see themselves as offering less support and causing more strain in both friend and family relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One thing that was really striking was how consistent the relationship between loneliness and negative self-perception was across different types of relationships,” Kent said. “It became clear that, whether it’s friends or family, loneliness was strongly linked to feeling like you give less support and contribute more strain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the researchers were especially interested in whether heart rate variability might play a role in how people interpret their own behavior. They found tentative evidence that this physiological trait slightly influenced the link between loneliness and perceived strain in family relationships. Among those with lower resting heart rate variability, the connection between loneliness and feeling like a burden to family was stronger. In contrast, people with higher resting variability showed a weaker link between loneliness and these self-critical perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This buffering effect did not appear in evaluations of friendships or in perceptions of how much support the individual believed they provided, suggesting that the influence of heart function may be specific to certain types of self-evaluations or relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were somewhat surprised to find that resting HF-HRV (our measure of physiological flexibility) only moderated this effect in family relationships and not friendships,” Kent remarked. “That suggests there may be more nuance in how these relationship types function and how sensitive they are to our internal regulation processes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that loneliness not only affects how people view others, but also how they view themselves — especially in the context of their relationships. The small but meaningful role of heart rate variability points to a potential physiological factor that influences how loneliness is processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Loneliness isn’t just about what support or strain you get from other people – it’s also about how you see yourself and your confidence in your ability to connect,” Kent told PsyPost. “If you feel lonely, you might be more likely to see yourself as burdensome or believe you have little to offer friends and family. Whether or not this lines up with reality, that kind of persistent negative self-view can increase feelings of disconnection. Lonely people may withdraw not just because others are pulling away, but because they feel incapable of contributing, creating a self-fulfilling cycle of further isolation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study found that people with greater physiological flexibility (reflected in better regulation of their body’s stress response) were less likely to hold these negative views of themselves when thinking about family relationships. Strategies like self-compassion, cognitive reframing, and emotion regulation practices that support physiological regulation may help people recognize these thought patterns and break the cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study adds to the growing understanding of how loneliness affects self-perception, it is not without limitations. One key issue is that the data are cross-sectional, meaning all measurements were taken at a single point in time. This makes it impossible to say whether loneliness causes changes in self-perception or whether negative self-perceptions drive loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the study relies on self-report measures. Although these perceptions may not reflect objective reality, they still tend to shape behavior — especially in the social realm. Someone who feels they are a burden may avoid contact with others, regardless of whether others actually view them that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physiological effects observed were also modest and specific to family relationships. The researchers caution against overinterpreting the heart rate variability findings without replication. They emphasize the need for future studies that track individuals over time to determine whether heart function helps predict long-term outcomes in social health and loneliness recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also open questions about how cultural factors and age-related changes might influence the findings. The MIDUS sample consisted largely of middle-aged and older adults. It’s unclear whether younger individuals — or those embedded in different cultural norms about family support — would show the same patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our long-term goal is to better understand the factors, including individual differences like self-perception, that contribute to variability in how people respond to loneliness,” Kent explained. “We hope to take a longitudinal approach and follow individuals over time to see how these self-views develop and change, and whether they predict who is more resilient to isolation or better able to reconnect socially.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70105" target="_blank"&gt;Loneliness Is Associated With Decreased Support and Increased Strain Given in Social Relationships&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Emily M Kent, Anita Restrepo, Kelly E.

Kennedy Jr. cited to justify &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html" target="_blank"&gt;canceling some $500 million in federal grants&lt;/a&gt; for mRNA vaccine research looked impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data, according to the agency, were embodied in some 400 research papers listed in &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26047485/mrna-vaccine-harms-research-collection-v2.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;a compilation that ran to 181 pages&lt;/a&gt;. The document was headlined “COVID-19 mRNA ‘vaccine’ harms research collection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After reviewing the science and consulting top experts at NIH and FDA,” Kennedy said on &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1952851097019633766" target="_blank"&gt;a video posted on X&lt;/a&gt;, referring to the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration, “HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits” for respiratory viruses such as COVID-19 and flu. “We reviewed the science, listened to the experts, and acted,” he wrote in an accompanying post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class="quote"&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="quote-body" data-long-quote&gt;I can say unequivocally that this was the most dangerous public health decision I have ever seen made by a government body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p class="quote-attribution"&gt;— Michael Osterholm, University of Minnesota&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is that so? A close look at the so-called data reveals that the vast majority of the cited papers — all but about 40 — have little or nothing to do with the vaccines. They concern the consequences of COVID-19 &lt;i&gt;infection&lt;/i&gt;, not the shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the papers that do reference the vaccines are studies not of human subjects, but laboratory mice; in some of these studies the mice received the vaccines via injections directly into the brain or intravenously, which is not how people receive the vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt; &lt;ps-newsletter-module class="module newsletter-module" data-id="519" data-module-id="00000198-9abf-dd0c-a19d-9ebf59ca0012"&gt; &lt;div class="module-container"&gt; &lt;p class="module-icon"&gt; &lt;svg class="icon flying-envelope-icon"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-flying-envelope"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;Newsletter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="module-title"&gt;Get the latest from Michael Hiltzik&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p class="module-description"&gt;Commentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="module-disclaimer"&gt; You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/ps-newsletter-module&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s also important is the lack of evidence supporting the agency’s claims. The data packet fails to include well-researched studies attesting to the safety and efficacy of the mRNA vaccines, including some published very recently. Among those is an exhaustive study by Danish researchers of more than 1 million recipients of the latest mRNA COVID booster, published July 28. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That study investigated the incidence of 29 potential adverse side effects from the vaccine, including heart, liver and kidney failure; neurological conditions; diabetes; and arthritis. It found &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26047605/andersson-2025-ld-250146-175285596115093.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;“no statistically significant risk”&lt;/a&gt; of any of them from the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle that is often cited by anti-vaccine agitators as a dangerous side effect of the mRNA vaccines. That condition was most commonly seen among young men, particularly if they had received two shots within a short time span. But for the most part it was mild and short-term; once the booster was reformulated after 2022, the effect appeared to disappear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No deaths from the condition were known to have occurred, and myocarditis effects were more common and serious among unvaccinated people infected with COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor did the agency’s data packet include &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26047632/ioannidis-2025-oi-250049-175285453990814.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;an estimate of lives saved&lt;/a&gt; by the COVID vaccines, led by Stanford epidemiologist John P.A. Ioannidis and published July 25. That study calculated that from the beginning of the global vaccination campaign in 2020 through September 2024 as many as 4 million lives were saved by the vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ioannidis acknowledged that his estimate is “conservative.” Indeed, in 2022 the Commonwealth Fund estimated that in just the first two years the vaccines were available, the shots prevented more than 18 million hospitalizations and &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26047632/ioannidis-2025-oi-250049-175285453990814.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;more than 3 million COVID-related deaths in the U.S. alone&lt;/a&gt;. A 2022 study in The Lancet, a British medical journal, estimated &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00320-6/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;as many as 20 million COVID-related lives saved&lt;/a&gt; around the world in just the first year of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weigh those figures against Kennedy’s assertion that the mRNA vaccines pose “more risks than benefits,” and it becomes evident that decision-making has gone seriously awry at the Department of Health and Human Services under Kennedy’s leadership. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/941921e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/320x252!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f5c0b66/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/568x447!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c6fd17c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/768x604!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5268ca3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/1024x806!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dd60747/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/1200x944!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="COVID deaths" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/744a35e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/320x252!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6a1e1fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/568x447!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5fb4a78/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/768x604!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e036f55/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/1024x806!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aad5698/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/1200x944!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aad5698/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/1200x944!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;Were the mRNA vaccines ineffective against COVID-19, as RFK Jr. claims? The CDC doesn’t think so: Its figures for 2020 showed much higher death rates among the unvaccinated (solid line) than the fully vaccinated (dashed and dotted lines).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Jake Scott, an infectious disease expert at Stanford Medical School who painstakingly examined the agency’s data citations, they point to “textbook confirmation bias”—the quest for information that confirms someone’s preexisting beliefs. In this case, that someone is Kennedy, whose &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-06-17/with-slate-of-anti-vaccine-moves-rfk-jr-steps-up-his-assault-on-public-health"&gt;record of anti-vaccine advocacy is indisputable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mismatch between the data packet cited by Kennedy and the established facts of the vaccines’ safety and efficacy explain why Kennedy’s cancellation of 22 contracts supporting mRNA vaccine research has been greeted by experts as a senseless and devastating blow against science and public health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have have been in this business for over 50 years on the front lines of public health,...and I can say unequivocally that this was &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/federal-mrna-funding-cut-is-most-dangerous-public-health-decision-ever-expert-says" target="_blank"&gt;the most dangerous public health decision I have ever seen&lt;/a&gt; made by a government body,” Michael Osterholm, an expert in infectious diseases at the University of Minnesota, told PBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the very least, if Kennedy is so convinced that the effects mRNA vaccines are not sufficiently well-understood, the solution is &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; research, not less. I asked Kennedy’s department to respond to criticism of his decision, but received no response.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A few words about the mRNA technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using messenger RNA as an intermediary in their actions, the vaccines instruct the body &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mrna-vaccine-tech-could-transform-medicine-and-cure-diseases-rfk-jr-just/" target="_blank"&gt;how to manufacture parts of a pathogen&lt;/a&gt; that its immune system can recognize and fight. For immunologists, the virtues of the new technology are manifest. Vaccines to combat new pathogens or new versions of existing pathogens can be engineered quickly, allowing them to be rolled out to stifle pandemics before they even emerge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential utility of mRNA vaccines is unprecedentedly broad. The possible targets under study today — including in some of the research contracts Kennedy cancelled — include flu, HIV, hepatitis C, malaria, tuberculosis, and cancer, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01393-8.epdf" target="_blank"&gt;Drew Weissman of the University of Pennsylvania and other scientists told Nature in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Weissman shared the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine with Katalin Karikó in 2023 for their work on mRNA vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., the development of the mRNA COVID vaccine was sponsored by $2.5 billion in grants and purchase guarantees from the federal government to Moderna, one of the two drugmakers that brought out the COVID vaccines, partially through Operation Warp Speed, an R&amp;amp;D effort under the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the agency that Kennedy has ordered to cancel the mRNA contracts. President Trump bragged about the achievement during his first term, but reversed course after the vaccines became the target of fearmongering from the right-wing and the anti-vaccine camp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kennedy’s video on X explaining his decision was replete with fundamental misconceptions about the vaccines, according to scientists and real-world data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As the pandemic showed us, mRNA vaccines don’t perform well against viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract,” he said. But that’s plainly contradicted by the record of lives saved and hospitalizations averted. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, which falls under Kennedy’s jurisdiction, show that the average weekly COVID case rate in late 2020 was 347.8 per 100,000 population among the unvaccinated, but 25 per 100,000 among the fully vaccinated and boosted population. The weekly average death rate in the same period was 7.8 among the unvaccinated and 0.1 among the vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He claimed that the vaccines promote the mutation of COVID; “one mutation, and the vaccine becomes ineffective,” Kennedy said. Neither of those statements is supported by science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MRNA vaccines do not cause the virus to mutate — they do that all on their own,” writes Steven Novella, a neurologist and veteran misinformation debunker. “What causes new variants to arise more quickly is allowing a virus to spread uninhibited throughout a population — the more it replicates, the more opportunities there are for new mutations. Widespread vaccination therefore decreases new mutations and variants.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, no “one mutation” causes the vaccines to become ineffective; as vaccinologist Peter Hotez observes, in no known case has a single mutation rendered the vaccine ineffective. Boosters developed for COVID variants have remained relatively effective even as new variants become dominant. Anyway, the virtue of mRNA technology is that the vaccine can be rapidly retooled to meet the challenge of new variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That brings us to the data package Kennedy’s agency offered to defend his decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not the product of U.S. government scientists, although one of its developers, Steven Hatfill, is currently on the HHS staff. Its other chief compilers are identified as Martin Wucher, a dentist ; Byram Bridle, a faculty member at a Canadian veterinary college; and Erik Sass, a nonfiction author. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reached out to all three for comment but received no reply. The compilation originated as material for a book titled “TOXIC SHOT: Facing the Dangers of the COVID ‘Vaccines’,” an anthology of essays by prominent anti-vaxxers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compilation doesn’t  make the case for canceling the research. A paper listed as support for the myocarditis threat, for example, states, &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26047793/icausality-ntramyocardial-inflammation-after-covid-19-vaccination-an-endomyocardial-biopsy-proven-case-series.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;“no causality can be assumed or established”&lt;/a&gt; linking the condition to the vaccine because of the lack of a control group for comparison. “There is no direct evidence of a vaccine-induced inflammatory response” to the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s action is almost certain to hamstring American science for years, possibly decades, to come. It’s the antithesis of Trump’s claim to put “America First,” for it cedes the development of a life-saving medical technology to Europe and China. And it’s not limited to the development of vaccines for respiratory diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a recent appearance on a podcast hosted by the right-wing influencer Steve Bannon, the newly-appointed commissioner of the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya, declared, “As far as public health goes for vaccines, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB0H2lJPGIk" target="_blank"&gt;the mRNA platform is no longer viable&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bhattacharya justified this statement by noting a rise in public skepticism about mRNA technology. What he didn’t say was that the skepticism was promoted  by Kennedy and other anti-vaxxers denigrating the technology; a competent and responsible NIH chief would be defending a technological innovation, not magnifying disinformation about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that the mRNA platform is likely to be seen in retrospect as a historic advance in healthcare ... everywhere but in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOS25OWF9GT0pudFYzVWowaFFTNnZEc0psR3Rmam51YV9xREc3QXdjUzgxOWdueU5rQWttbmxWZUo0RFZRTXd0STFkSk4tQWNFc2V0ajRyMmF4dGFZeTNQMzZnMmlXM2hzdHlLWTZicFd4NFVReFNzRjNibjMwWmlBRnBtbUQwWFdWT1BCUEJEX1BPeW83cjcyM1VyV18</guid></item><item><title>罗奇博士：以下是人们现在可以做出的改变，以避免以后出现痴呆症-底特律新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1gFBVV95cUxPOG1ybkRQRHcyMnF3MV9CZVBTczRDbEZJNGk2OEREd092OFBMb1h0Y1Z1ejV3QkJmYzJKNm4wTFBTUGo3cnY0alMtaVhfV3pPcl9Db0dod050dTFPOHBZZWwtcEFEekFJY2l1aFNYdHE5U0JhcXFDbkgxWGFOUWp1WXVYMkpXc2JoTjZ3cUkwQkMybWxHcDBIaWNZay00VHN0d3ZCVllTSjJzMjdoTkFEbnlXU0kxdl85QkJ6THFjRjZXVGpONHVFbGp0cS1CSGxXYzJITEZB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_by"&gt;Dr. Keith Roach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; The females in my family on my mother's side seem to develop dementia/Alzheimer's on a fairly regular basis. It seems to become noticeable once the women are in their mid-70s or so. We girls are concerned as we head toward our elderly years and wondered which sort of diet or supplemental changes we should look into? There seems to be so many articles and opinions that it's hard to know where to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On the positive side, our father's side of the family seems healthy and robust well into their 80s and 90s. Our extended family has females ranging from their mid-30s to 71 years of age. Are we being overly concerned? Could this be a genetic thing? Any suggestions would be helpful in calming some real fears that we have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— E.J.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear E.J.:&lt;/strong&gt; I don't think supplements are going to be the answer for dementia. I haven't seen any good data to support any of the supplements I see that are touted to prevent, slow, treat or cure dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I do think that diet may help slow dementia, and one of the best diets according to the studies that have been done so far remains a Mediterranean-style diet. This includes plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes, fish (especially fatty fish), limited amounts of red meat, and minimally processed foods. Alcohol is increasingly likely to be problematic, and I recommend against more than occasional alcohol use for people who want to minimize their risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Regular moderate exercise has a pretty clear protective effect. Although cognitive exercises like games and puzzles help improve memory short-term, it's not clear that they are preventing or delaying the onset of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Advanced imaging, such as PET scans, are beginning to show the ability to diagnose Alzheimer's dementia in people with early symptoms. Early treatment to attack amyloids in the brain with lecanemab or donanemab slows progression of dementia by approximately 25% to 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; I cared for my ailing mother, and even though I tried to minimize my stress, I gained a lot of weight and still have my "cortisol belly." I need to get healthy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— D.H.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear D.H.:&lt;/strong&gt; Taking care of a family member is always stressful. Taking care of yourself as well is hard, and most of us aren't able to eat, sleep, exercise, and otherwise take good care of ourselves as well as we should during a period of time when we are taking care of others. Most of us have other demands, including family and work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Although I often see the term "cortisol belly," it isn't the slightly elevated level of stress hormones that causes the abdominal weight gain. People who have Cushing's syndrome develop a particular type of abdominal weight gain as a result of dramatically elevated cortisol levels, as a result of a tumor, or by taking high doses of steroids. In your case, it's more likely that the result of not having healthy behaviors lead to your weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Losing abdominal weight is achieved through the same ways you would lose weight anywhere. I won't ever say it's easy, but a combination of a healthy diet and regular exercise is going to improve your health, whether you lose a pound or not. I don't recommend medication treatment to lose weight unless a person is very overweight ("morbidly obese" is the precise medical term) or has medical complications related to their weight.&lt;em&gt; Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 09:57:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1gFBVV95cUxPOG1ybkRQRHcyMnF3MV9CZVBTczRDbEZJNGk2OEREd092OFBMb1h0Y1Z1ejV3QkJmYzJKNm4wTFBTUGo3cnY0alMtaVhfV3pPcl9Db0dod050dTFPOHBZZWwtcEFEekFJY2l1aFNYdHE5U0JhcXFDbkgxWGFOUWp1WXVYMkpXc2JoTjZ3cUkwQkMybWxHcDBIaWNZay00VHN0d3ZCVllTSjJzMjdoTkFEbnlXU0kxdl85QkJ6THFjRjZXVGpONHVFbGp0cS1CSGxXYzJITEZB</guid></item></channel></rss>
