So when he suddenly experienced left-sided weakness, numbness and difficulties with balance, walking, swallowing and speech, a family member rushed him to a nearby stroke clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His blood pressure was sky high — about 254 over 150 millimeters — yet when you looked at him you've never know it, because he looked so well. That's why we call hypertension the silent killer," said Dr. Sunil Munshi, a consulting physician at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munshi is the senior author of a case report about the man, a warehouse worker from Sherwood, Nottingham, whose name was withheld to protect his privacy. The paper was &lt;a href="https://casereports.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bcr-2025-267441" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal BMJ Case Reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Normal blood pressure for adults&lt;/a&gt; is less than 120 over 80 mm HG (millimeters of mercury). Blood pressure of 180 over 120 or higher is considered a medical crisis that requires immediate emergency care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His left side was numb, and scans showed he had a stroke in the deeper part of the brain, the thalamus, which explains the unsteadiness," Munshi said. "He was admitted, and we treated him with five different medications until his blood pressure dropped to 170."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at home again, the man's blood pressure continued to climb, reaching 220 despite numerous drugs. Munshi and his team searched for answers for weeks, running extensive tests that turned up negative. Then one day the man told Munshi about his energy drink habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Each day he consumed eight highly potent energy drinks to stay alert for his job — two cans at four different times during the day," Munshi said. (The brand name was withheld from the study.) "Each of the drinks contained 160 milligrams of caffeine. Suddenly the diagnosis was clear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some energy drinks can have up to 500 milligrams of caffeine, compared with 30 milligrams in tea and 90 milligrams in coffee, said study first author Dr. Martha Coyle, a resident doctor at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the UK, guidelines suggest 400 milligrams of caffeine a day, between two and four cups," Coyle said. "This gentleman was consuming 1,200 to 1,300 milligrams, three times the amount."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also r&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much#:~:text=Daily%20Caffeine%20Consumption%20for%20Most,generally%20associated%20with%20negative%20effects." rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;ecommends&lt;/a&gt; no more than 400 milligrams a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just weeks after stopping his consumption of the energy drink, the man's blood pressure returned to normal. Today, years after the incident, he is healthy but still lives with the aftermath of his stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I obviously wasn't aware of the dangers drinking energy drinks were causing to myself," the man told his doctors. "(I) have been left with numbness (in my) left hand side hand and fingers, foot and toes even after eight years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Combinations of ingredients 'cause havoc'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just high levels of caffeine. Today's energy drinks also contain blood pressure boosting ingredients such as the amino acid taurine, Munshi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Energy drinks that contain caffeine plus taurine produce significantly higher blood pressure than caffeine alone," he said. "They also contain high levels of glucose — we know sugar damages the blood vessels in diabetes, which leads to heart damage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy drinks also typically contain ginseng, which impacts metabolism, and guarana, a plant thought to contain caffeine at twice the concentration of a coffee bean, according to the study. Milder stimulants such as theophylline, found in cocoa, and theobromine, found in tea, are often included as well, Coyle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such energy drinks can cause cardiac arrhythmias, damage the endothelium, the tissue that lines blood vessels, and aggregate blood platelets, Munshi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When platelets are aggregated, especially in the setting of high glucose, they can produce blood clots," he said. "Young people are often willing to try energy drinks, especially in combination with other drugs such as cocaine or methylamphetamine, which have similar effects, and all of these drugs together can cause havoc."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical literature is full of examples of the harms of energy drinks, so this case, while startling, is not an isolated event, Munshi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have seen other patients who developed an irregular heartbeat, what we call atrial fibrillation," he said." Another patient developed an intracellular hemorrhage in the brain, while yet another patient had a stroke in the brain due to a blood clot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munshi believes doctors need to become more aware of the impact of energy drinks and ask about use during regular checkups, "especially when people come at a younger age with cardiovascular problems or strokes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The nature of these drinks is changing. They have become more and more dangerous and more potent," he added. "We propose increased regulation of energy drink sales and advertising campaigns, which are often targeted at younger ages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

As the virus evolves, some signs you’re sick might too. So, what are COVID-19 symptoms in 2025? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="3" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;While some liken it to the common cold, COVID-19 is still a lethal disease, and certain groups are still at a higher risk of a more severe form of the virus. But many people are experiencing an uncomfortable illness with symptoms that are slightly different from what having COVID-19 used to feel like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Infectious disease doctors stress that every person’s experience with the virus is different. “So many infections now are milder, but there are still people being hospitalized with COVID,” says &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="William Schaffner, M.D.," data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;William Schaffner, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="body-tip css-19jy3s emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="6.0"&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=trusso" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=trusso" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Thomas Russo, M.D.," data-node-id="6.2" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Thomas Russo, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York; &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="William Schaffner, M.D.," data-node-id="6.4" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;William Schaffner, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Even if you’re not in a high-risk group for serious complications from COVID-19, “you can’t count on avoiding severe illness,” says &lt;a href="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=trusso" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=trusso" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Thomas Russo, M.D.," data-node-id="7.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Thomas Russo, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;So, what are the biggest COVID symptoms right now? Here’s what you should know. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-covid-19-symptoms-now" data-node-id="9" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="9.0"&gt;What are COVID-19 symptoms now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Again, everyone’s experience with COVID-19 is slightly different. “It depends on a combination of how much virus you’re exposed to, what your underlying state of immunity is, and the underlying host—are you a younger, healthier host, an older host, or have underlying health conditions?” Dr. Russo says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But doctors agree that there are a few COVID-19 symptoms that many people are experiencing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="12" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="12.0"&gt;      Sore throat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="12.1"&gt;      Sinus congestion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="12.2"&gt;      Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;This constellation of symptoms can make COVID-19 feel like a bad cold, if you’re lucky enough to get a mild case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But it’s still possible to experience the other legacy symptoms of COVID-19, which may &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/signs-symptoms/index.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="include" data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;include&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="15" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;

&lt;li data-node-id="15.17"&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-are-some-people-experiencing-more-mild-symptoms" data-node-id="16" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;Why are some people experiencing more mild symptoms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;It’s likely due to a few factors, including the different dominant variant and built-up immunity to the virus (from vaccination and previous infection), Dr. Russo says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;It’s also just the nature of the virus, according to Dr. Schaffner. “COVID is a respiratory virus, and all of these viruses can produce similar symptoms involving the nose, throat, and chest,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Again, that doesn’t mean that this is what COVID-19 will look like for you—it’s just what many people are experiencing right now. “I’m thrilled that many people are experiencing mild symptoms, but you can’t count on that, particularly if you haven’t gotten your vaccine or boosters, and haven’t recently been infected,” Dr. Russo says. “The subsequent consequences of COVID, in terms of long COVID, is much more significant than it is for influenza.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="where-are-cases-surging" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;Where are cases surging?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;According to wastewater data from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC), COVID-19 cases are currently high in these states:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="22" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="22.0"&gt;      Alabama&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="22.1"&gt;

Overall, Dr. Russo says it’s safe to assume that you’re not likely to infect anyone 10 days after you first got sick. “That’s a safe rule of thumb,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you’re planning to be around people who are vulnerable to getting seriously ill before then, like small children, older adults, and people with underlying health conditions, Dr. Russo recommends wearing a mask. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-protect-yourself-from-covid-19-right-now" data-node-id="28" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.0"&gt;How to protect yourself from COVID-19 right now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;No shocker here—doctors recommend getting your updated &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a64839017/updated-fda-covid-vaccine-stricter-regulations/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a64839017/updated-fda-covid-vaccine-stricter-regulations/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="COVID-19 vaccine" data-node-id="29.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, if you haven’t already.  “Think about getting out your mask and think twice about those holiday gatherings, especially if you’re high-risk,” Dr. Schaffner says. And, of course, do your best to stay away from people who are obviously sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;While many people have stopped testing themselves for COVID-19, it’s still worth taking an &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/g45086861/best-at-home-covid-test/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/g45086861/best-at-home-covid-test/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="at-home COVID test" data-node-id="30.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;at-home COVID test&lt;/a&gt; if you’ll be around vulnerable people—or just don’t want to spread what you’ve got to anyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 13:32:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNQXI2b2Q4VXNETTduRGJ2Q3JnbW8zd0xERU1ENUNBQVFJempYUTJOT29JYnRWZHgzYmRHb2RJY0J4eTVCaTFpaGNwQlEydU1ydlhSR0w3OExJMjZHTmtZdzJYTkVwT0piWUNlRVkyYU5OcndCZFhWUHhHZHJJUUNiYjNvSzN5RnBONWlQenJSazE</guid></item><item><title>医生说COVID症状正在发生变化-以下是使用新变体需要注意的事项- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/doctors-covid-symptoms-changing-watch-133000031.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;The 3 Most Common Signs of COVID Right Now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;sakchai vongsasiripat - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stratus variant is fueling COVID-19 cases around the country.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Symptoms of the virus look slightly different right now. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here, doctors share what to look out for and how to protect yourself from the latest variant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A newer COVID variant called XFG is currently fueling cases of the virus across the country.

But many people are experiencing an uncomfortable illness with symptoms that are slightly different from what having COVID-19 used to feel like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infectious disease doctors stress that every person’s experience with the virus is different. “So many infections now are milder, but there are still people being hospitalized with COVID,” says &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:William Schaffner, M.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;William Schaffner, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=trusso" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Thomas Russo, M.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Thomas Russo, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York; &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:William Schaffner, M.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;William Schaffner, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re not in a high-risk group for serious complications from COVID-19, “you can’t count on avoiding severe illness,” says &lt;a href="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=trusso" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Thomas Russo, M.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Thomas Russo, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what are the biggest COVID symptoms right now? Here’s what you should know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are COVID-19 symptoms now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, everyone’s experience with COVID-19 is slightly different. “It depends on a combination of how much virus you’re exposed to, what your underlying state of immunity is, and the underlying host—are you a younger, healthier host, an older host, or have underlying health conditions?” Dr. Russo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But doctors agree that there are a few COVID-19 symptoms that many people are experiencing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sore throat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinus congestion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Runny nose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This constellation of symptoms can make COVID-19 feel like a bad cold, if you’re lucky enough to get a mild case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s still possible to experience the other legacy symptoms of COVID-19, which may &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/signs-symptoms/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:include;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;include&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are some people experiencing more mild symptoms?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s likely due to a few factors, including the different dominant variant and built-up immunity to the virus (from vaccination and previous infection), Dr. Russo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also just the nature of the virus, according to Dr. Schaffner. “COVID is a respiratory virus, and all of these viruses can produce similar symptoms involving the nose, throat, and chest,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, that doesn’t mean that this is what COVID-19 will look like for you—it’s just what many people are experiencing right now. “I’m thrilled that many people are experiencing mild symptoms, but you can’t count on that, particularly if you haven’t gotten your vaccine or boosters, and haven’t recently been infected,” Dr. Russo says. “The subsequent consequences of COVID, in terms of long COVID, is much more significant than it is for influenza.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where are cases surging?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to wastewater data from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC), COVID-19 cases are currently high in these states:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alabama&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indiana&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vermont&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of other states with moderate levels of the virus, per CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long are you contagious with COVID-19?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of time you’re contagious with COVID-19 can vary, but the virus tends to follow a certain pattern in terms of being able to infect others. “You’re contagious for the day before you get sick and then most contagious for the next two to three days,” Dr. Schaffner says. “It tapers off after that, but it’s not like a light switch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been vaccinated, the amount of time that you’re contagious will be less than if you’re unvaccinated, Dr. Russo says. Overall, Dr. Russo says it’s safe to assume that you’re not likely to infect anyone 10 days after you first got sick. “That’s a safe rule of thumb,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re planning to be around people who are vulnerable to getting seriously ill before then, like small children, older adults, and people with underlying health conditions, Dr. Russo recommends wearing a mask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to protect yourself from COVID-19 right now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No shocker here—doctors recommend getting your updated &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a64839017/updated-fda-covid-vaccine-stricter-regulations/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:COVID-19 vaccine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, if you haven’t already. “Think about getting out your mask and think twice about those holiday gatherings, especially if you’re high-risk,” Dr. Schaffner says. And, of course, do your best to stay away from people who are obviously sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many people have stopped testing themselves for COVID-19, it’s still worth taking an &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/g45086861/best-at-home-covid-test/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:at-home COVID test;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;at-home COVID test&lt;/a&gt; if you’ll be around vulnerable people—or just don’t want to spread what you’ve got to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNRnpPbzczMi1CcjVYRnJULVNKVTA2bFB3RjdvVkZucHFfUHRfSXE1VldDVDkzZk95SWxXNHlQWTRpSzlBQU5LSzBURE9PajJXajlTUEtKVW51ekphWjZKdE1SU21HLUx1MDdIc2htU1NVaWtrSjZWSjZaRFdaT1RkWUFrTV9qWWNT</guid></item><item><title>密歇根州耐药真菌的崛起- MLive.com</title><link>https://www.mlive.com/news/2025/12/what-to-know-about-drug-resistant-fungus-on-the-rise-in-michigan.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3PV6PW5E7JBRJJQSU6NNON6VRY"&gt;Michigan hospitals have noted a rise in a drug-resistant fungal infection in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="W265FY4RDJCHFIZPADLVWQKQUQ"&gt;Candida auris was first identified in a resident in 2021.

Dolan at PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This means that genes that give a sensitivity to PTSD also increase the likelihood for misophonia, and that could point to a shared neurobiological system that affects both.

They reported feeling trapped or helpless and unable to escape the noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, people with misophonia were more likely to be bothered by sounds like normal breathing and swallowing, whereas these didn't prompt any reaction in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregory and the UK team think their survey may be a useful tool to help other clinicians identify those troubled by misophonia – a term that they report less than 14 percent of their sample population were previously aware of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/misophonia-turns-out-to-be-way-more-common-than-we-thought"&gt;Misophonia Turns Out to Be Way More Common Than We Thought&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies like these are invaluable for understanding how our perception of the world links with our mind's ability to cope within it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb0"&gt;"We conclude that – based on the genetics of a common misophonia symptom – misophonia most strongly clusters with psychiatric disorders and a personality profile consistent with anxiety and PTSD," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2022.971752"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; the Netherlands team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2022.971752"&gt;Frontiers in Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in October 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When Dr. Su Wang was in medical school, she donated blood. That's when she learned she was infected with hepatitis B, a virus that attacks the liver and can lead to cancer and death decades later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was 18, healthy, in college," she said. "And suddenly I had a chronic illness I didn't even know about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in Florida in 1975, Wang grew up before the hepatitis B vaccine was routinely given to newborns. For years, she assumed she had been infected by her mother, only to discover later that both her parents were negative. "It turns out my grandparents, who cared for me after birth, probably passed it to me," she said. "That's how easy this virus spreads — not from some exotic risk factor, just family."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Wang is the medical director for viral hepatitis programs at RWJBarnabas Health in New Jersey. Her story now sits at the center of a historic turning point in public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 5, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-acip-vaccine-panel-hepatitis-b-birth-dose/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;voted to end the universal U.S. recommendation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the newborn dose of the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hepatitis-b-vaccine-what-parents-need-to-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;hepatitis B vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, instead adopting a policy urging individual-based decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    &lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the new approach, only infants born to mothers who test positive for hepatitis B will automatically receive a dose of the vaccine and hepatitis B antibodies shortly after birth. For everyone else, if the parents choose to vaccinate, the birth dose can be delayed until 2 months of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the committee members were &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-cdc-acip-members-covid-vaccine-critics/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;appointed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist. In an 8-to-3 vote, the panel decided that since most pregnant women now receive hepatitis B testing, administering the vaccine at birth should be reserved for infants whose mothers test positive. They framed the shift as a way to reduce interventions deemed unnecessary, align vaccination with test results, and give parents more control over timing. Supporters of the decision described it as a move toward parental choice rather than a reflection of changing epidemiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to many clinicians and epidemiologists, the change represents a dangerous rollback that could reverse three decades of progress toward eliminating a disease that still infects as many as 2.4 million Americans and kills tens of thousands each year. They see echoes of the 1980s, when risk-based vaccination left entire generations unprotected, and worry the country is about to repeat that mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the panel's move on hepatitis B — in the face of overwhelming data that shows the birth dose is effective and safe — portends further upheaval for the nation's childhood vaccine schedule, a cornerstone of public health.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They're not just trying to change one vaccine," said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist and an editor of the scientific journal Vaccine. "They're trying to dismantle how vaccine policy is made." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Emily Hilliard responded: "ACIP reviews all evidence presented and issues recommendations based on evidence and sound judgment to best protect America's children."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of a &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project/hepatitis-b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;new independent review&lt;/a&gt; by the Vaccine Integrity Project, which evaluated more than 400 studies and reports, warned in a &lt;a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/CDC-2025-0783-2400" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;public comment&lt;/a&gt; that delaying the birth dose "would reduce protection for infants and increase the risk of avoidable HBV infections, undermining decades of progress" toward eliminating the hepatitis B virus. The review was led by researchers at the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, which created the Vaccine Integrity Project in response to what it regards as Trump administration actions that "&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/VIP-FullReport_Final_7-25.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;put the federal vaccine landscape at risk&lt;/a&gt;," and it was vetted by outside experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We fought hard for that universal birth dose because targeted approaches missed too many babies," Wang said. "We know what happens when you wait."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's unfolding now is not just a technical policy update but a fundamental test of the systems meant to protect the most vulnerable. The debate turns on a few critical questions — whether testing is reliable enough to replace universal safeguards, how infectious hepatitis B truly is, why past strategies failed, and what the CDC's internal shake-ups mean for vaccine policy writ large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The limits of testing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B testing sits at the center of the new ACIP recommendation, but even the CDC acknowledges that testing alone can't guarantee protection. Pregnant women may test negative if the virus was acquired late in pregnancy or during the "window period," before hepatitis B surface antigens become detectable. False negatives happen. No testing system, no matter how well designed, can catch every infection. That's why universal vaccination was created in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a mother's status is unknown at delivery, hospitals are supposed to give the newborn a hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours, adding hepatitis B antibodies for premature infants or if the mother later tests positive. But in real clinical settings, these safeguards routinely break down. Results take time. Nurses miss or misread labs. Pharmacies delay deliveries. Documentation gets lost.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Every step you add increases the chance that something falls through the cracks," Wang said. "Delaying the vaccine just adds another."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP's vote shows how that logic is being challenged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some committee members suggested dropping the third hepatitis B shot if antibody levels look high after the second. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Brian McMahon, a liver disease specialist who has spent decades treating hepatitis B, told the panelists that the data doesn't support that idea. "Only maybe 20% to 30%" of infants have an adequate antibody level after the first dose, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You need two doses to really reach a high level of protection," he said, with the third shot giving a stronger, longer-lasting response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the overall message coming from the committee seemed designed to "discourage the birth dose."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're making it more and more difficult," McMahon said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second vote, ACIP also encouraged parents and clinicians to order post-vaccine serology tests — blood tests that measure protective antibody levels — after the second or third dose. The tests, ACIP said, should be covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More infectious than HIV or hepatitis C&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B can survive on toothbrushes, razors, and household surfaces for a week. It spreads not just from mother to child but also through ordinary family contact: shared items, open sores, small blood exposures. In the 1980s, researchers found that about half of infections in American children came not from mothers but from other household members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why state health departments continue to insist that every newborn be vaccinated within 24 hours of delivery, regardless of maternal status. "Delaying vaccination misses a crucial period of potential exposure," &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/han/advisory/2025/han-advisory-24-hepatitis-b-birth-dose.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;a New York advisory&lt;/a&gt; warned this year. The vaccine, it noted, is 80% to 100% effective when given on time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vaccine Integrity Project report underscores the stakes. Since the universal birth dose was introduced in 1991, pediatric hepatitis B infections in the U.S. have dropped by more than 99%. A &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;2024 CDC analysis&lt;/a&gt; estimated that the current schedule has prevented more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits are lifelong. Infants vaccinated at birth are shielded not just from hepatitis B but also from the liver failure and cancer it can cause decades later. Yet because the disease unfolds slowly, the consequences of policy shifts may not surface for 20 or 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Trieu Pham, a California physician, doesn't need to imagine those consequences. Born in Vietnam in 1976, he probably contracted the virus at birth. "If the vaccine had existed then, I wouldn't have gone through what I did," he said. Diagnosed in his 20s, he developed cirrhosis by 40. At 47, he was coughing blood from ruptured esophageal veins. Eventually, he required a liver transplant to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You live with this constant fatigue and fear," he said. "And the saddest part is it was preventable."&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc6" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",6]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His three children, all vaccinated within hours of birth, are free of hepatitis B. "That's the difference a day can make," Pham said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A lesson already learned&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1982, ACIP recommended the new hepatitis B vaccine only for adults at high risk: health care workers, injection drug users, and men who have sex with men. But by the late 1980s, it was clear that risk-based vaccination couldn't contain transmission. Many newly infected adults didn't fit any defined risk group. Identifying high-risk people proved imperfect, stigmatizing, and ultimately ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, infants infected during or shortly after birth had a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/perinatal-provider-overview/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;90% chance&lt;/a&gt; of developing chronic infection, compared with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/perinatal-provider-overview/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;less than 5%&lt;/a&gt; in adults. Yet public health officials repeated the same targeted strategy, this time with newborns. In 1988, the CDC recommended universal prenatal screening and linked an infant's vaccination to the mother's test result, again basing protection on a risk marker instead of vaccinating all infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As before, it failed. Many infected mothers weren't correctly identified. Some were never tested, some were tested too early, and others had results that were misread or never communicated. Too many infants slipped through the cracks, proof that another targeted approach couldn't reliably protect them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1991, the CDC issued its landmark guidance recommending that all infants, regardless of their mother's infection status, receive a hepatitis B vaccine at birth, followed by two additional doses in infancy. By 2005, the policy was fully embedded in the routine immunization schedule, then reaffirmed in 2018. This evolution was based on data showing that a universal strategy, rather than a targeted one, was the most effective in preventing infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A matter of trust&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC's new hepatitis B policy rests on the premise that moving the decision to parents will strengthen trust in the vaccine system. Supporters frame it as an empowerment shift — a way to give families more control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1999, when it was last recommended to postpone the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine for infants born to uninfected mothers, vaccination rates &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/190937" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;also dropped&lt;/a&gt; among infants born to those who were infected.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc7" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",7]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Opt-in policies sound patient-centered," Wang said, "but in practice they're inequitable. They leave behind the very families who need protection most" — the ones most likely to miss prenatal care and testing, have infections that go undetected or arise after testing, or slip through gaps in hospital care, as well as infants who can be exposed and infected by other caregivers and household members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are often immigrant families, including from Asian and Pacific Islander communities in which hepatitis B remains endemic.

"These experiences – especially when they're unexpected or surprising – can be very confusing for people and may be isolating," Sevelius says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Ideally, professional support is involved, if not during the trip itself, then in the important work that comes afterward while processing it. "It is really important that psychedelic-assisted therapy practitioners are affirming and aware of the potential for someone's sense of identity to evolve, and to see this not as a negative outcome but as potentially healing," Sevelius says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-bc40c3a0-0 kXcvpr"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 jJmNMc"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0mmzccn.jpg.webp 160w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0mmzccn.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0mmzccn.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mmzccn.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0mmzccn.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0mmzccn.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0mmzccn.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0mmzccn.jpg.webp 1376w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0mmzccn.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0mmzccn.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images There has been a resurgence in research on the therapeutic use of psychedelics such as psilocybin, which is found in magic mushrooms (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;There has been a resurgence in research on the therapeutic use of psychedelics such as psilocybin, which is found in magic mushrooms (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Many people do not have the resources to seek help from therapists who are competent in psychedelics, identity-affirming integration, LGBTQ+ issues or all three. Family and friends can also provide crucial lifelines for a person processing major shifts to their identity, but again, not everyone has a supportive network. For people raised by caregivers who "talked about never being able to accept a queer kid", Voce says, or who belong to a straight, conservative peer group, "it's much harder to say, 'I'm the person who's going against the grain'".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It can also be difficult if a current romantic partner is not on board. "That can be an identity shift for the other person in the relationship too," says Kayla Knopp, a licensed clinical psychologist and, with Khalifian, a co-founder of Enamory. A husband and wife in their 60s recently came to Knopp, for example, after the husband started exploring bisexuality and gender identity, and trying out cross-dressing. The wife "had a really negative reaction", Knopp says. Tensions were eased somewhat after the couple tried ketamine-assisted therapy and found, afterwards, that they were better able to talk through what this meant for their relationship. "It wasn't a big, dramatic thing," Knopp says. "They just both felt a little more open and softer with each other."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQOElJNG1tR0hNaGdodG1wWFJrUjl4X2thWDhzcm05X2stM0tyUS12MGdnLWpLS0V1dXNtM3g5bTlMN1JSTGtoUGNmYURONkhoME8zRjEzd2lEWXZnUmdrY25DaTVSOElOY1FuTjZyTkFlSmd3bndoU3VhSkM3MXN0bzZWZmlqX1laX0lxLTlzU2pWdzBkTjVYQzlFVVRralVveTNSWGF1RFlyWEFSbEMzaVlOQWVGZw</guid></item><item><title>四张图表中的流感-今年的冬季疫情有何不同- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yq9wr3pnro</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;Flu in four charts -  how this year's winter outbreak is different&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-573fa0e8-0 bWRWzH"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-573fa0e8-11 cOQNNv"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0" class="sc-573fa0e8-5 ciiGlA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-573fa0e8-7 kdBCdE"&gt;Jim Reed,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0-role-location" class="sc-573fa0e8-8 eDNgSC"&gt;Health reporter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc-573fa0e8-9 keGieE"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-1" class="sc-573fa0e8-5 ciiGlA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-573fa0e8-7 kdBCdE"&gt;Wesley Stephenson,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-1-role-location" class="sc-573fa0e8-8 eDNgSC"&gt;BBC Verify&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 eRlINq"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c59f/live/687689b0-d6e1-11f0-aa51-f3f688349a6c.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c59f/live/687689b0-d6e1-11f0-aa51-f3f688349a6c.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c59f/live/687689b0-d6e1-11f0-aa51-f3f688349a6c.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c59f/live/687689b0-d6e1-11f0-aa51-f3f688349a6c.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c59f/live/687689b0-d6e1-11f0-aa51-f3f688349a6c.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c59f/live/687689b0-d6e1-11f0-aa51-f3f688349a6c.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c59f/live/687689b0-d6e1-11f0-aa51-f3f688349a6c.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c59f/live/687689b0-d6e1-11f0-aa51-f3f688349a6c.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A female paramedic opening the door to an ambulance.

But Chris Streather, the medical director for the NHS in London, said the situation was "well within the boundaries" of what the NHS could cope with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;How then is winter 2025 really any different and which patients have been affected most by what the NHS is now describing as "super flu"?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;An earlier start for flu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The major difference between 2025's flu season and the previous three years is that the virus started spreading around a month earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The first sign of this was in October in data published by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;When someone goes to their GP or hospital with flu-like symptoms they can be tested for a number of viruses including influenza, Covid and RSV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;UKHSA records the percentage of those tests that come back positive for flu, which can then give a strong indication that rates in the community are either rising or falling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Virologists have linked the earlier flu season this year to a subtle shift in the genetic makeup of the main flu virus that is circulating - called H3N2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So-called 'super-flu' is not a medical term and it does not mean the virus is more severe or harder to treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But the general public has not encountered this exact version of flu before, which means there may be less immunity built up in society, allowing it to spread more easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Children and young people most affected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Children tend to be more susceptible to flu than older adults, partly because their immune systems are still developing and because they tend to spread viruses more quickly through close contact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The latest breakdown of UKHSA data shows that the proportion of positive tests is currently much higher in children and young people still at school or university. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some schools have had to bring back Covid-like measures to prevent the spread of the virus, such as cutting back on singing in assemblies and introducing sanitisation stations, &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3e0z9433pwo" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;while one site in Caerphilly had to close temporarily&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Each year thousands of otherwise healthy children end up in A&amp;amp;E with complications after catching influenza. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But there is another concern: that younger people will go home and then spread the disease to elderly relatives who tend to be more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Flu adds to winter pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The NHS records the number of patients in hospital each week with influenza and other types of respiratory illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The number has been rising sharply in England with an average of 2,660 flu patients taking up a hospital bed last week, up from 1,717 in the previous week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Those over 85-years-old are five times more likely to be hospitalised than the general population.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But the patients being admitted now would have been infected with the virus a week or so ago when infection rates were lower. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The greater concern for the health service is what happens over the coming weeks as new cases appear in A&amp;amp;E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The NHS has roughly 105,000 available hospital beds in England and tends to "run hot" over the winter with 95% of those taken up at any one time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If the number of flu patients needing overnight treatment jumps to 5,000 or higher, as Sir Jim Mackey predicts, then it could put the whole hospital system under more pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;What about vaccine protection?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The message coming from doctors and the NHS is for people in vulnerable groups to continue to come forward for a flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Even though the genetic make-up of the virus has shifted this winter, the main jab is still thought to offer effective protection, particularly against severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The flu vaccine is free on the NHS for those over 65-years-old, young children, pregnant women, those with certain health conditions, carers, and front line health and social care workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;People in other groups can get the same vaccine for between £15 and £25 from high street pharmacists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;As of 30 November, around 70% of older people and care home residents had taken up the offer of a free flu jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But vaccination rates in younger at-risk groups such as the clinically vulnerable were lower at just over 40%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Rates among NHS workers in England, which have fallen back since the Covid pandemic, appear to have stabilised this year at roughly the same level - around 42%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0

Based on the study’s data, Barouch said Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center has started a clinical trial with one such drug — abrocitinib, which is used to treat eczema.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The viral remnant hypothesis emerged over the last several years because researchers found small viral fragments in people with long COVID. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“That was an attractive hypothesis because we have antivirals,” Barouch said. “The problem is that so far, the first three studies that have been published with Paxlovid [an antiviral used to treat COVID-19] that I’m aware of showed no therapeutic efficacy.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Data from the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2828033" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2828033"&gt;National Health Interview Survey&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 estimated that 3.6 percent of Americans were  suffering from long COVID at the time, compared to 8.4 percent who ever had long COVID. The chronic condition is highly varied, characterized by symptoms that can include extreme exhaustion, difficulty breathing, neurological problems, chronic pain, and brain fog. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Long COVID occurs after a COVID-19 infection, lasts for at least three months, and affects one or more organ systems, according to an &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2408466" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;official definition&lt;/a&gt; published by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine in July 2024.

Walker/Globe Staff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Barouch’s study looked at two cohorts of COVID patients, from 2020 to 2021 and again for confirmation from 2023 to 2024. They found that patients with long COVID had a substantially increased level of chronic inflammation compared to those who had recovered from COVID-19 infection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Through blood tests, researchers found persistent activation over six months of several chronic inflammatory pathways, which are complex cascades that activate the immune system to fight infection or injury. For both cohorts, researchers collected plasma and cells from blood during acute COVID-19 infection, 90 to 180 days post-infection, and more than 180 days post-infection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s really yet another piece of this big complex puzzle we call long COVID,” said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, chief of research and development at the VA St. Louis Health Care System and leading long COVID researcher who was not involved in the study. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The important thing here is that some of the identified signatures of long COVID in this paper could be potentially leveraged as therapeutic opportunities,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;One chronic inflammation pathway that was the most activated was the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, one of many systems that play a role in the immune response, Barouch said. Inhibitors of the JAK-STAT pathways are already approved, such as abrocitinib, the anti-inflammatory drug Barouch is testing for long COVID in a clinical trial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;High chronic inflammation was consistent across both cohorts of long COVID patients and over time, the study shows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Normally you see inflammation go up and then come down,” Barouch said. “Here in the long COVID patients, we saw the chronic inflammation go up and stay up.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;While this study doesn’t introduce a new theory, Al-Aly said it brings clarity to exactly what chronic inflammatory pathways are activated in long COVID patients. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The hypothesis of chronic inflammation leading to long COVID is out there, and people have been researching it,” he said. “I’m not shocked or surprised, but I’m pleased … that now we have a little bit more clarity about what is going on in these patients.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Barouch said more research would be needed to firmly establish chronic inflammation as the cause for long COVID and generalize it to a larger population. The first cohort, enrolled early in the pandemic, included 142 individuals, and the second cohort included 38 individuals, for a total of 180 patients. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But the data was quite convincing, Barouch said, especially for individuals with long COVID who  primarily experience brain fog and fatigue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Al-Aly said the reason for studying the origin of a disease like long-COVID, even in a small group of people, is not just to satisfy intellectual curiosity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“If there’s an exemplar of why studying mechanisms is important, it’s this paper, because sometimes you find things that you can immediately link to potential therapeutics,” Al-Aly said. “Deep insight into why the disease is happening in some people is really enormously valuable, because it can help us develop treatment and ease suffering of people.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

While a death by suicide for some is preceded by suicidal ideation and behavior, including survived attempts, about half of those who take their own lives have no documented suicidal thoughts or behaviors and no known mental health conditions linked to suicide risk, such as depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;There were no clear indicators of risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Those are the findings of a genetic study in which university researchers teamed up with the Utah Office of the Medical Examiner to try to learn more about the drivers of suicide, using genotyping data from 2,769 de-identified electronic health records and clinical notes of individuals who died by suicide. They thoroughly analyzed the genetic data of those who died to analyze genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The findings are published in &lt;a href="https://watermark02.silverchair.com/coon_2025_oi_251059_1760388425.74069.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAzAwggMsBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggMdMIIDGQIBADCCAxIGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMMrMjdVOV90MbBoDVAgEQgIIC40PE0-ucUk8hn9auL2MvPT_sucKLI9gHAdz55lPV0yVS7WV2O2YczMTfrh5h8N05Uw3Z3Hv_BtJreoRd3GjmXVgcVkk7_tMGW1s2oSj0kLXKl3r4M6AUWyZJ6ScJbrjXX03YjvhCSb-q0eZK0FuiH4WHvmkgzySTfldJ_oHnbQr30fhxXVgIIWnQXXoqHpfwTsy5vNf2XbLcZjw4Rn4RkZCR8UHxvGIoTszfxg3CIIow1MmAP1d9Wwtcg4qjCGX8_NfS2-2h4xDrZ9OCzZiKKlkfNvLigU0-AwWO5NLpBPTtDPCrTyYDiFuvWmRZfJxTVUU4dvmXapw60TAtk3PeDpU0VOmqjTpkNaJ265gCRPw455q16QzNTacAzTc2PN1jgPq2gA7GlkEnWrrT4SxS1boDSGObDDDN6LhKOWXiZ5tj_fH1rHFgHdPlWEhxHxNAQBvLAVzUYNXd021LlvREt-BEY660g8OIXi0pMmRkP2hY7m8xpPu6B2i1ZtnQntkQUFVCX3K434r3gJ3MbH-MkApFqfM8A_QkE2A7OG7NggfDk03xj5lDgx9OBl1PDQzGR5N0rts6etlJF3myYNd9Klx4W9NuTdn5pP-O6DaCMbavo4GbHvm1tOonP4IyM_FTbn3KQeZdo_w1HbNydHfo_8PuvCk9owmCaFEg6-b1HRQDDo_VUqwspIsqN8zNHUNHRL7ARLCPSibVa4pMvG4Y_B0zRtAI7R2L3w0rTvwKH486Zo76OtZ7wJrl4NKGX5-QY327PkzphfMxPNh6kHZVZ3YKoEipkSdLHanFtNc06oqNeBcH4aOpkYppjaZamCNRLSicJwdMjxXFbojKJSu9J-16o2IGvarL9PJi8FBWgpuvYUjznSoq2gfcYpHx4_uqsbyPSloFcvIw_nAnczN-lEVUxRutya77uNDjcX2eiCzWBePxAgROT-8pLtP4cSKXJQth8XbinjfYikmVGRv-u45LDHY" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://watermark02.silverchair.com/coon_2025_oi_251059_1760388425.74069.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAzAwggMsBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggMdMIIDGQIBADCCAxIGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMMrMjdVOV90MbBoDVAgEQgIIC40PE0-ucUk8hn9auL2MvPT_sucKLI9gHAdz55lPV0yVS7WV2O2YczMTfrh5h8N05Uw3Z3Hv_BtJreoRd3GjmXVgcVkk7_tMGW1s2oSj0kLXKl3r4M6AUWyZJ6ScJbrjXX03YjvhCSb-q0eZK0FuiH4WHvmkgzySTfldJ_oHnbQr30fhxXVgIIWnQXXoqHpfwTsy5vNf2XbLcZjw4Rn4RkZCR8UHxvGIoTszfxg3CIIow1MmAP1d9Wwtcg4qjCGX8_NfS2-2h4xDrZ9OCzZiKKlkfNvLigU0-AwWO5NLpBPTtDPCrTyYDiFuvWmRZfJxTVUU4dvmXapw60TAtk3PeDpU0VOmqjTpkNaJ265gCRPw455q16QzNTacAzTc2PN1jgPq2gA7GlkEnWrrT4SxS1boDSGObDDDN6LhKOWXiZ5tj_fH1rHFgHdPlWEhxHxNAQBvLAVzUYNXd021LlvREt-BEY660g8OIXi0pMmRkP2hY7m8xpPu6B2i1ZtnQntkQUFVCX3K434r3gJ3MbH-MkApFqfM8A_QkE2A7OG7NggfDk03xj5lDgx9OBl1PDQzGR5N0rts6etlJF3myYNd9Klx4W9NuTdn5pP-O6DaCMbavo4GbHvm1tOonP4IyM_FTbn3KQeZdo_w1HbNydHfo_8PuvCk9owmCaFEg6-b1HRQDDo_VUqwspIsqN8zNHUNHRL7ARLCPSibVa4pMvG4Y_B0zRtAI7R2L3w0rTvwKH486Zo76OtZ7wJrl4NKGX5-QY327PkzphfMxPNh6kHZVZ3YKoEipkSdLHanFtNc06oqNeBcH4aOpkYppjaZamCNRLSicJwdMjxXFbojKJSu9J-16o2IGvarL9PJi8FBWgpuvYUjznSoq2gfcYpHx4_uqsbyPSloFcvIw_nAnczN-lEVUxRutya77uNDjcX2eiCzWBePxAgROT-8pLtP4cSKXJQth8XbinjfYikmVGRv-u45LDHY"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The study showed that those who died by suicide without earlier suicidal behaviors had fewer psychiatric diagnoses and underlying genetic risk factors for mental health conditions than those who exhibited warning signs, according to Hilary Coon, a professor of psychiatry in the Spencer Fox Eccles School of Medicine at the University of Utah and the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She told Deseret News that the sheer number of suicide deaths with no previous indicators, including depression diagnosis, suggests it’s not just a matter of many not having sought treatment or due to gaps in screening or care. It indicates that paying attention to mental health remains very important, but that emphasis alone is not likely to identify all who may ultimately end their own lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Maybe we need to think about what people struggle with in a more broad way,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Suicide-a-multifaceted-issue" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Suicide a multifaceted issue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2023, 49,000 individuals in the U.S. ended their own lives, making suicide the 11th leading cause of death nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Coon describes suicide as a complicated behavior. She noted that what’s going on with someone who is young and impulsive or dealing with significant depression is different from someone later in life who has chronic health conditions or other stressors, for instance. She spoke of suicide survivors who said they were not depressed or anxious, but rather were in situations that felt unmanageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She also noted that at some point everyone experiences traumas and events that are challenging and most don’t take their lives. But the difference between those who do and those who don’t is hard to untangle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Traditional screening is likely ineffective in many cases, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Prior suicidality is the most robust estimator of suicide death,&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;but the association with this estimator is imperfect, and many suicide deaths occur in its absence,” per the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Regarding clinical interventions, the study said “a focus solely on mental illness risk reduction may be less effective for individuals for whom this underlying liability may be substantially lower.” It added that “further understanding of clinical characteristics, underlying genetic liabilities, and external exposures” in those cases without known previous suicidal behaviors or mental health challenges “will be required to direct more targeted interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Clinicians do a good job of understanding people who have warning signs. The others, we don’t know who they are,” Coon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Screening-risk-factors" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Screening risk factors&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;When they looked at the genetic data, the researchers found those without earlier suicidal ideation and behavior had fewer risk factors for a variety of psychiatric conditions — not just depression, but also anxiety, Alzheimer’s disease and post traumatic stress disorder. They appeared to have less genetic vulnerability to other conditions, like heart disease. In a news release about the study, the researchers said that “this group isn’t any more likely than the general population to have milder conditions like depressed mood and neuroticism,” either. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers note some limitations, including that some with previous suicidal notions may not have had those captured in the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;They also noted most of those in the data were of European ancestry, so findings might not be generalizable to all groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Coon said that future research will try to tease out some of the hidden risk factors, including links between suicide and chronic pain or major medical issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She and her colleagues are also trying to figure out what factors might be protective against suicide. People in similar situations have different degrees of resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Coon is careful to point out that genetic risk factors that may play a role still have a very small effect on risk overall and that none of them actually cause suicide. As the background material notes, “Environmental and societal contexts are crucial contributors to risk, and understanding the interplay between the environmental and underlying biology will be essential to discovering who’s at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She’s hoping the research they’ve done will help identify other factors and their contexts outside of mental distress that contribute to risk so that suicides can be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We hope our work will begin to define subsets of individuals at risk, and also the contexts in which these risk characteristics may be important,” Coon said in the news release. “If people have a certain type of clinical diagnosis that makes them particularly vulnerable within particular environmental contexts, they still may not ever say they’re suicidal. We hope our work may help reveal traits and contexts associated with high risk so that doctors can deliver care more effectively and specifically. ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Coon also suggested resources for those who may be struggling:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/hmhi/programs/crisis-diversion/988" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://healthcare.utah.edu/hmhi/programs/crisis-diversion/988"&gt;Call 988&lt;/a&gt; to reach a 24/7 free, confidential support line for suicidal crisis or emotional distress.

Researchers tested whether raising NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels with high-dose nicotinamide riboside could help restore energy metabolism and ease symptoms. While the randomized trial didn’t show major differences in cognitive scores between treatment and placebo groups, participants who took NR for at least 10 weeks reported improvements in fatigue, sleep, mood, and some executive function tasks. The results highlight both the complexity of long COVID and a promising direction for future therapies focused on cellular energy and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chao-Yi Wu, PhD, OT, from the Department of Neurology and Edmarie Guzmán-Vélez, PhD, of the Department of Psychiatry at Mass General Brigham, are the lead and senior authors of a paper published in &lt;em&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/em&gt;, "Effects of Nicotinamide Riboside on NAD+ Levels, Cognition, and Symptom Recovery in Long-COVID: A Randomized Controlled Trial."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How would you summarize your study for a lay audience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of people worldwide continue to experience lingering symptoms after COVID-19, a condition known as long COVID. These symptoms can affect people of all ages and often include neurological issues such as "brain fog," which makes thinking and memory difficult. Because these problems can significantly disrupt daily life, researchers are working to find effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our clinical trial tested whether raising levels of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; -- a molecule that helps cells produce energy -- through nicotinamide riboside (NR), a form of vitamin B3, could improve health outcomes. Participants took NR supplements for up to 20 weeks, and we tracked changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What question were you investigating? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; molecule is present in all human cells and is essential for energy production, immune function and inflammation control. Previous research suggests COVID-19 may interfere with NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-related biological processes, possibly contributing to neurological symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our study, we wanted to know if boosting NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; through NR supplementation could improve cognitive function and ease common long COVID symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What methods or approach did you use?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ran a 24-week clinical trial at Massachusetts General Hospital between August 2021 and September 2023. We enrolled 58 people with long COVID and randomly split them into two groups:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;One group took 2,000 mg of NR every day for 20 weeks.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The other group took a placebo (a fake pill) for 10 weeks, then switched to NR for the next 10 weeks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure unbiased results, neither the participants nor the researchers knew who was getting the real supplement at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We measured NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels through blood tests and asked participants to complete surveys and cognitive tests about memory, sleep, fatigue and mood at the beginning, at 10 weeks and at 20 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What did you find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 58 people who joined the study, 37 started NR right away, and 21 began with the placebo. Only 18 people completed the full 22-week protocol. The others left the study for reasons such as getting COVID again, moving, changing medications or experiencing possible side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we compared the two groups, we didn't see major differences in thinking or memory scores, which were the main focuses of the study. Other symptoms like fatigue, sleep and mood also didn't show big differences between groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in exploratory post hoc analyses with a slightly larger sample size of everyone who took NR for at least 10 weeks, we observed improvements in self-reported fatigue, sleep, and depressive symptoms after 10 weeks of NR supplementation compared to baseline. Some also performed better on a task of executive functioning, a set of mental skills that help us, for example, plan, organize, and switch between tasks. This suggests that some people may benefit from the use of NR, even if the overall results didn't show clear differences between groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What are the implications?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long COVID affects an estimated 400 million people worldwide, yet its causes remain unclear. In this study, high-dose NR safely boosted NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels. While results were mixed, findings suggest that boosting NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; may play a role in easing symptoms like fatigue and poor sleep for some people. This points to a promising direction for future treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common side effects were mild, such as easy bruising or rash. None were serious, and only a few participants discontinued due to side effects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What are the next steps?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future studies should include larger and more diverse groups to confirm these findings and identify who benefits most. For example, do men and women respond differently? Are people with lower baseline NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels or higher inflammation more likely to improve? Because long COVID often involves inflammation, an important question is whether boosting NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can help reduce it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also plan to analyze physical activity data collected during the trial, as well as examine whether other supplements taken by participants influenced NR's effects.&lt;/p&gt;

						Classes are canceled at a southern Iowa school district Friday, Dec. 12, after a case of whooping cough was confirmed. Officials with Davis County Community School District in Bloomfield said Thursday afternoon that the case of whooping cough, also called pertussis, was confirmed at the elementary school. Pertussis is a contagious respiratory illness. It gets its name based on the "whooping" someone makes while gasping for air after coughing."School will be canceled (Friday) as we continue our investigation and receive guidance from public health officials," Superintendent Megan Christiansen said in a post on the district's Facebook page. School events and activities have been canceled or postponed Thursday, Friday and Saturday, according to the school's activities calendar.Christiansen is also superintendent of Moulton-Udell Community School District, which canceled classes Tuesday and Wednesday due to 30% of students and staff being out — many with influenza A.The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services recommends that Iowans take the following steps to stay healthy this winter:Stay home and avoid social gatherings if you or your children are sick.Clean high-touch surfaces in your home frequently with household disinfectants.Practice hand hygiene frequently with soap and water or hand sanitizer for at least 20 seconds.Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, or if a tissue is not available, cover them with an upper shirt sleeve, not a hand.Keep children home from daycare or school who have fever, cough, congestion, runny nose, or sore throat, and until they are fever-free for 24 hours without medications that reduce fever.If you or a loved one is sick and needs medical care, contact your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider can offer advice on whether you or your child needs to be evaluated in person, tested for flu or other respiratory diseases, and the best location for care.Iowa vaccination rates for whooping coughIowa's 2-year-old immunization rates for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis have risen since 2015, from 68.6% in that year to 89.5% in 2024, according to data on the Iowa Health and Human Services website.In Davis County, the 2-year-old rate is lower for this vaccine, according to HHS.

She had just given birth to her first child. “It was a crossroads moment for me, with the fear of denial, but I chose action,” Karipa, who is now in her 50s, said at an Aids awareness event in Papua New Guinea’s capital Port Moresby in December. She and the baby received treatment, and her child remains healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Karipa, from East Sepik in northern PNG, is unusual in sharing her story. The stigma around the disease is high in the Pacific nation, but speaking out has never been more important. This year PNG declared HIV a “national crisis”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;UNAids, the UN agency that fights HIV/Aids globally, says the epidemic in PNG is among the fastest growing in the Asia-Pacific region, along with Fiji and the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;New infections have doubled since 2010 and it is estimated that only 59% of people living with the virus know they are HIV positive. The rise of infections in women and children is particularly alarming, UNAids says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="9b98fb0c-f2a9-4d51-8f76-6ab86dba5580" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Aid cuts have shaken HIV/Aids care to its core – and will mean millions more infections ahead","elementId":"9b98fb0c-f2a9-4d51-8f76-6ab86dba5580","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/01/global-health-hiv-aids-funding-cuts-infections-prevention"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The transmission of [the virus from] mother to child is very high in Papua New Guinea, one of the highest globally,” says Manoela Manova, UNAids country director for PNG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Changes to funding for HIV support and prevention have hit PNG hard. The suspension of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/24/foreign-aid-israel-egypt" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;US foreign aid &lt;/a&gt;by the Trump administration this year has affected hundreds of clinics.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Sharp global reductions in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/01/global-health-hiv-aids-funding-cuts-infections-prevention#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20estimated%20that,than%20it%20was%20in%202023.&amp;amp;text=Winnie%20Byanyima%2C%20the%20UNAids%20executive,was%20shaken%20to%20its%20core.%E2%80%9D" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;funding for UNAids&lt;/a&gt; is also worrying health providers, and calls for the PNG government to do more are growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Manova says HIV awareness has declined over time and now, “it’s like the feeling that the epidemic does not exist”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“That’s the perception in both the public and in the political class.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="20337c4c-3ff1-4dbe-b73f-a3466b30269b" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;There are concerns not enough people in PNG are aware of the threat from HIV/Aids.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Torsten Blackwood/AFP/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The crisis in the country of about 10 million people is compounded by a combination of factors, including inadequate testing and lack of awareness. UNAids says PNG recorded an estimated 11,000 new cases in 2024, with nearly half of all new infections &lt;a href="https://unaids-ap.org/2025/06/26/national-hiv-crisis-declared-in-papua-new-guinea/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;among children and people aged under 25&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An estimated 2,700 infants were infected with HIV in PNG in 2024. In most cases, mothers were unaware of their HIV status and didn’t receive the necessary antiretroviral therapy (ART) which could have prevented transmission to their child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“A lot of people do not know their status and that’s the first step to addressing the epidemic [and] to be put on treatment,” Manova says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="us-aid-freeze-hits-clinics" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;US aid freeze hits clinics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The government declared HIV a national crisis in June and put in place an emergency response plan including more testing, treatment and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Deputy secretary of health, Ken Wai, says while the government is responsible for drug supplies, other support services and community outreach has depended heavily on US aid. In January, the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/24/foreign-aid-israel-egypt" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cut foreign aid&lt;/a&gt;, which was distributed through the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/03/elon-musk-says-usaid-is-beyond-repair-and-he-is-working-to-shut-it-down" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;United States Agency for International Development (USA&lt;/a&gt;ID&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/03/elon-musk-says-usaid-is-beyond-repair-and-he-is-working-to-shut-it-down" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;, although Wai says some funding has been restored to specific programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“USAID finances an organisation called FHI360; they help us with data recording, and one laboratory coordinator assists at the central public health laboratory,” Wai says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Chair of the national Aids council, Wep Kanawi, says the government must do more to address the crisis. The council works to prevent HIV transmission and provide treatment across the country. Kanawi says the government does not receive direct funding from USAID for HIV medicines, but PNG does seek funding from global not-for-profit organisations which receive contributions from USAID. That then supports some HIV programs in PNG, including paying staff salaries, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kanawi says more than 200 clinics run by the government or churches that provide HIV services have lost funding after the US suspended foreign aid&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;earlier this year, without providing further details about the services the clinics provide. Kanawi wants the government to do more, and says about K45-K50m (US$10m) annually is needed to deal with the epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Many of our centres are operating but scaling down on their operations,” Kanawi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kaugere Clinic in Port Moresby, which provides HIV and other health services, is one of the centres affected by the funding freeze. Rose Marai, a social worker at the clinic, says when aid was suspended by the Trump administration, salaries at the clinic were withheld because there was no funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There was no second plan given to us and we were told to close down the clinic, which had affected the communities,” Marai says. “I used to receive K1,000 (US$235) to run a day awareness program in communities but since the stop of funding I now receive K240 monthly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I started doing voluntary counselling of referral patients who were already tested positive, STI and gender-based violence couples.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The US embassy in PNG did not respond to questions about USAID or US funding. In a statement, it said the US is “committed to our partnership with Papua New Guinea”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“US foreign assistance to PNG, managed through the Department of State and other US agencies, includes robust programs in security cooperation, disaster preparedness, and health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/12/embed-80-zip/giv-32554hrsJrk2qEbpv","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"map of png","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":0},"elementId":"142cbcf8-12ab-4a43-8dc2-a4bd3215bee0","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="142cbcf8-12ab-4a43-8dc2-a4bd3215bee0" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="map of png" data-testid="interactive-element-map%20of%20png" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/12/embed-80-zip/giv-32554hrsJrk2qEbpv" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;map of png&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the same time, UNAids has this year seen what it describes as a “historic funding crisis” because of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jul/04/us-aid-cuts-kill-millions-unaids-head-winnie-byanyima" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cuts in the US foreign aid budget&lt;/a&gt; and reductions from &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/01/global-health-hiv-aids-funding-cuts-infections-prevention#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20estimated%20that,than%20it%20was%20in%202023.&amp;amp;text=Winnie%20Byanyima%2C%20the%20UNAids%20executive,was%20shaken%20to%20its%20core.%E2%80%9D" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;other donor countries.&lt;/a&gt; A December report from UNAids said abrupt funding reductions and persistent funding shortfalls “are having profound, lasting effects on the health” of millions of people, although it noted funding for some HIV programs has restarted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;UNAids in PNG say the country has so far been shielded from the hit as Australia stepped in with additional funding.

Around 8% of women have it, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/anaemia-iron-deficiency/background-information/prevalence/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence&lt;/a&gt;, while far fewer men are affected  – only 3% in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Pregnancy - like Rose had just experienced - is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/iron-deficiency-anaemia/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;a common cause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Rose's symptoms - tiredness, dizziness and tongue ulcers - are just some of the things to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Other common symptoms can include shortness of breath, heart palpitations, paler than usual skin and headaches, while some people could experience rarer symptoms like tinnitus, restless legs syndrome and hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;For her deficiency, Rose was initially prescribed iron tablets - the most common form of treatment - but, despite trying three different ones, found none of them agreed with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Sue Pavord, a consultant haematologist at NHS Hospitals Oxford, says taking iron tablets first thing in the morning on an empty stomach with a glass of water or some Vitamin C is the best approach - otherwise you risk them not working effectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;After she responded badly to tablets, Rose's doctor referred her for an iron infusion - a way of quickly getting iron into your bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This can be "transformative for women with severe deficiency", Dr Pavord says, but she also stresses that tablets can work "extremely well" so it's important to try them first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But what you eat can also help limit your risk of becoming iron deficient in the first place, according to Dr Pavord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She suggests foods which contain absorbable iron like red meat, chicken, liver and fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Vegetables like spinach, kale and broccoli also contain iron, but the body doesn't absorb it from these sources as effectively as meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Two-and-a-half months on from her infusion, Rose says she feels like "a completely different person".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I can do stuff.

This is important because, as we age, the risk of falls increases, with one in four American adults age 65 and older falling each year.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While this may not sound like a big deal, falls are the leading cause of fatal and nonfatal injuries in this age group.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Injuries from falls also add up to more than $80 billion in healthcare costs each year in the U.S.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that many falls are preventable with some strategic planning. Part of this includes &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/afternoon-habit-women-after-50-for-healthy-aging-11830800" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;incorporating exercises&lt;/a&gt; into your routine that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/walking-mistakes-and-how-to-fix-them-7158418" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;strengthen muscles related to walking&lt;/a&gt; and standing, and you don't have to go to the gym to do them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In a recent &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DR5Js54koWf/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Instagram post&lt;/a&gt;, Joy Bhat, M.D., shared insights into how her 79-year-old father, &lt;a href="https://jivahealth.com/providers/naras-bhat-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Naras Bhat, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, became a "super ager" by staying strong, sharp, mobile and independent. "It's not luck," writes Bhat. "It's these five habits he does every single day."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--instagram"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bhat notes that the best part is that what her dad does isn't an actual workout. "They're simple, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-add-movement-limited-time-11772724" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;habit-stacked movements&lt;/a&gt; built into his morning and daily routine. Because longevity isn't created only in the gym. It's created in the moments you repeat, day after day."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Habit stacking is a strategy used to help people change their habits. You incorporate (or stack) the new habit you're trying to create with habits you already have. For example, doing side and rear leg lifts while you wash dishes or push-ups off the kitchen counter while making lunches.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here's how Bhat habit-stacks his exercises throughout the day to stay strong:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-glute-bridges"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Glute Bridges  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before even getting out of bed, Bhat does &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7949443/best-strength-training-exercises/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;glute bridges&lt;/a&gt;, which strengthen the glutes (butt muscles), hamstrings (back of thigh muscles) and hips. You can also get the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-for-better-balance-and-stability-11800652" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;core muscles&lt;/a&gt; involved by intentionally pulling your belly button in toward your spine while holding the bridge pose. All of these muscle groups play a crucial role in walking and balance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-one-legged-standing"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; One-Legged Standing &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While Bhat brushes his teeth, he stands on one leg while lightly holding onto the bathroom sink. Balance tends to be one of the first skills that weaken as we age, so being intentional about incorporating exercises that safely &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7917613/exercises-to-improve-balance/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;challenge balance&lt;/a&gt; is imperative.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While facing the bathroom sink and holding onto it, Bhat does heel and toe raises. Heel raises strengthen the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8021161/what-to-eat-to-build-muscle/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calf muscles&lt;/a&gt;, while toe raises focus on the shin muscles. Both are involved with keeping the legs and ankles strong. To hit all parts of the calf muscles, perform three different sets of heel raises: one with toes pointing forward, one with feet turned out and one with feet turned in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-sit-stands"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Sit-Stands &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the dinner table, Bhat does sit-stands. This involves standing up from a sitting position without pushing off with your hands, then slowly sitting back down without plopping down or using your hands. This can also be done while watching TV or sitting at your desk. This exercise targets several muscle groups, including front and rear thighs (quads and hamstrings), glutes and core muscles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-planks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Planks &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; During Bhat's computer breaks, he does planks. In the reel, it shows Bhat doing full planks with arms and legs extended. This is more of an advanced plank, so feel free to modify it by keeping your knees on the floor. You can also go onto your forearms. No matter which position you choose, the primary goal is to pull the belly button up toward the spine, keep the head in line with your spine (in other words, your chin should not be on your chest) and keep your elbows in alignment with your shoulders. Remember to breathe throughout the exercise.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's essential to remember you're never too young or too old to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/expert-reveals-what-leads-to-longevity-11831397" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;focus on healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;, and consistency is the key to cultivating new habits. "Healthy aging is built in small moments," says Bhat. "And as my dad shows every day, it's never too late to start!"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you want to make some changes to your routine for healthier aging, we recommend pairing these exercises with meals chock-full of foods that can help support your health as you get older, including &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-for-cognitive-function-after-age-60-11807629" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plenty of veggies, fish and plant protein&lt;/a&gt;.

It’s concerning, she said, because Utah hasn’t had this many measles cases in more than 30 years. Nationwide, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 1,912 cases in 2025 — the highest number since the disease was considered eliminated here in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The U.S. could actually lose that declared status soon if any outbreak lasts more than 12 months. Canada recently lost its status as a country where measles was eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In Utah specifically, it doesn’t help that measles was first seen largely in the southern part of the state near the Arizona border, but there have now been cases in central and northern Utah, too, according to the Utah Department of Health and Human Services’ &lt;a href="https://files.epi.utah.gov/Utah%20measles%20dashboard.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://files.epi.utah.gov/Utah%20measles%20dashboard.html"&gt;measles dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Thursday, during a media briefing, Nolen said that cases have been confirmed recently in Salt Lake, Davis, Utah and Wasatch counties, among others. And they’re expecting to learn of more because measles is an incredibly contagious illness that can linger in the air for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;If 20 people who were unvaccinated or never had measles were to be exposed, 18 of them would come down with measles, Nolen said. It’s more contagious than the flu or COVID-19 or pretty much anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;A happy note, according to Nolen and Dorothy Adams, a Salt Lake County Health expert speaking on behalf of the Utah Association of Local Health Departments, is that about 90% of Utah residents are vaccinated against measles. Tempering that is the fact that herd immunity requires a 95% vaccination rate. When enough people are vaccinated, it largely stops the spread, shielding those who for various reasons cannot be vaccinated, including very young babies, who Nolen described as very vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2179"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/JUBD5DDJFVA3RA4T3MGGDMTCNI.JPG?auth=eb978da8f0db7fe049a00ab362f75c9908ef1709ce209121d6a26d1d1aaf3348&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=581" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/JUBD5DDJFVA3RA4T3MGGDMTCNI.JPG?auth=eb978da8f0db7fe049a00ab362f75c9908ef1709ce209121d6a26d1d1aaf3348&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1162 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;The Utah state epidemiologist, Dr. Leisha Nolen, left, and Dorothy Adams of Salt Lake County Health, representing the Utah Association of Local Health Departments, speak with reporters about the measles update at the Multi-Agency State Office Building in Salt Lake City on Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Laura Seitz, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Nearly 70% of the cases have involved children and the vast majority of those who have been infected have not been vaccinated, they said, though there were seven breakthrough cases where someone had at least partial vaccination and still got sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="A-miserable-and-maybe-dangerous-illness" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;A miserable and maybe dangerous illness&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Measles cases can be mild, but they aren’t always. So far in Utah, 12 people have required hospitalization in 2025, according to the dashboard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Those at highest risk of complications include children younger than 5, adults over 20, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; said that complications range from common ills like ear infections, diarrhea and pneumonia — which is a common cause of deaths that can occur — to brain inflammation that can lead to permanent damage and a rare but fatal brain disease called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis that shows up years after someone apparently recovered from measles. Pregnant women can miscarry or deliver too soon or have low-birthweight babies. And complications for those with compromised immune systems, young children and adults over age 20 can include blindness and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Measles has a timeline of sorts. Typically people have a high fever, cough, runny nose and red watery eyes for a few days, then they develop little white spots inside their mouth two or three days after that. Between three and five days, usually, after symptoms begin, the familiar rash pops up, usually on the face at the hairline before moving down and covering the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2223"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/OOTJY5HBTFAA7NWDHEA5V62NKM.JPG?auth=0068dc8e4ae0ea86d29aaa7c8a7767d0e7943cd54fdc3ba0a5a365e41856db2c&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=592" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/OOTJY5HBTFAA7NWDHEA5V62NKM.JPG?auth=0068dc8e4ae0ea86d29aaa7c8a7767d0e7943cd54fdc3ba0a5a365e41856db2c&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1184 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Jody deJonge, R.N., holds a multi-dose vial of the measles, mumps and rubella virus vaccination at the Salt Lake Public Health Center in Salt Lake City on Wednesday, July 9, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Laura Seitz, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="Reducing-risk-of-spread" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Reducing risk of spread&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Earlier Thursday during a national briefing on vaccine schedules hosted by the National Press Foundation, Dr. Mona Amin, a board-certified pediatrician who founded &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-pedsdoctalk-podcast-child-health-development/id1501057527" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;PedsDocTalk&lt;/a&gt;, said the risk of the illness itself is not worth taking, given how well tolerated the vaccine is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;While vaccines were hailed as the best way to prevent the spread of measles — Nolen called it 95% effective and said it has a decades-long history of being safe with mild side effects — the briefing was also about other ways to stop the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Call ahead if you think you’re sick or were exposed was advice from both Adams and Nolen, who said that showing up in a doctor’s office and waiting increases the likelihood that others in the waiting room could become infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That allows health care providers to take precautions to protect other patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The need to protect babies came up several times in the briefing, because babies don’t usually qualify for that vaccine until they’re at least a year old, though with so many cases around, Nolen said there’s an option to get a baby vaccinated for measles at 6 months. In normal times, with little spread, she said that’s not usually recommended, but she called it “reasonable” given the surge in cases. Those babies would also get a dose at the regular time, so it’s an extra dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Others who are not vaccinated but are exposed can also get a measles vaccination and if it’s done within days, it can offer some protection and reduce the risk of serious illness, per Nolen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Adams talked about contact tracing as a tool to stop the spread of measles, noting that the investigations are done to prevent spread. When a case is confirmed, health departments reach out to learn where the person had been with the goal of warning those who might have been exposed to watch for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2136"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/EOKCBV3RDZFUHM2RXNACJU63XM.JPG?auth=deaaeacf2be8a40a4352af68bf5d93e045ace28ea2523b777ae96b4a2d728754&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=569" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/EOKCBV3RDZFUHM2RXNACJU63XM.JPG?auth=deaaeacf2be8a40a4352af68bf5d93e045ace28ea2523b777ae96b4a2d728754&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1138 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Dorothy Adams of Salt Lake County Health, representing the Utah Association of Local Health Departments, speaks with reporters about the measles update at the Multi-Agency State Office Building in Salt Lake City on Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Laura Seitz, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She acknowledged that people might be suspicious to receive a phone call from a stranger asking health questions, and encouraged anyone who isn’t sure to call their local health department and verify that the person who called them works there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She asked that people do that instead of letting worry prevent them from answering questions that could reduce spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Because many people don’t suspect measles until they have the signature rash, there’s not a big window to offer symptom-reducing treatment. So prevention is key, said Adams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 23:54:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPRFRsR0pQY0hWRU1GcGx6VVFwSzhQZU9qTDlOQlRXdTc5T1RnUTdQRGxpUTByd3N2TUV3WDFOSks3bmZZRk9nb0ppTm5SbFdEWGl6N1poaEtQNThmQjc0bkZMaGNLZ1FKQ0R4TmNCTEZKWnhIVHRaMmtlMC04dFBCUXBWSlZzVXJGejRKQXVuc0xTeUhlYlNtblZyQXkyZUE</guid></item><item><title>妻子说， CDC疫苗小组的新主席被儿科诊所解雇- thehill.com</title><link>https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5645398-milhoan-cardiology-termination-acip-cdc/</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

When we drink energy drinks, our bodies are more alert and focused, thanks in part to an increase in adrenaline. The specific effects—as well as their intensity and duration—depend on the individual and total caffeine consumed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-are-energy-drinks-different-than-coffee" data-node-id="8" class="body-h2 css-guqo8m emevuu60"&gt;How Are Energy Drinks Different Than Coffee?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-15" data-node-id="9" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-y6m8k e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-1am3yn9 e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-10bgxwr e1geg53v2"&gt;Dan Kitwood&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-10t3vcu e1geg53v0"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-10bgxwr e1geg53v1"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;It's complicated. The category is huge, and there’s no single comparison that fits every brand. Generally, though, many energy drinks deliver more caffeine per serving than a standard cup of coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wowmd.com/pages/catherine-gervacio" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.wowmd.com/pages/catherine-gervacio" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Catherine Gervacio" data-node-id="11.0" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;Catherine Gervacio&lt;/a&gt;, RND, a registered nutritionist and diet consultant for WOWMD, notes that an average 8-ounce cup of brewed coffee contains about 95-100 mg of caffeine. Energy drinks vary wildly, but often contain between 70 to 200 mg per serving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Caffeine sources differ, too, which can affect overall nutritional value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“Different sources contain not only caffeine but also other beneficial compounds like antioxidants and minerals, which can contribute to the overall nutritional value,” says Dasgupta. “For example, green tea is rich in antioxidants, which many energy drinks don’t have, giving it an edge in terms of health. Guarana and yerba mate also include natural compounds that can enhance mood and energy. On the other hand, artificial or heavily processed caffeine sources often miss out on these benefits.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The biggest difference is often the sugar content. &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/just-for-fun/a63325264/is-coffee-healthy-to-drink-every-day/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.delish.com/just-for-fun/a63325264/is-coffee-healthy-to-drink-every-day/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Coffee" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;Coffee&lt;/a&gt; can be sweetened to personal taste; many energy drinks are high in added sugar. A single 16-oz can of &lt;a href="https://www.rockstarenergy.com/products/the-original" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.rockstarenergy.com/products/the-original" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rockstar’s original formula" data-node-id="15.3" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;Rockstar’s original formula&lt;/a&gt; packs a whopping 63 grams of sugar—127% of the daily recommended intake. Other brands opt for artificial sweeteners, which have been linked in research to a higher risk of &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a41136822/study-artificial-sweeteners-linked-to-higher-risk-of-heart-disease/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a41136822/study-artificial-sweeteners-linked-to-higher-risk-of-heart-disease/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="heart disease and stroke" data-node-id="15.5" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;heart disease and stroke&lt;/a&gt; over time.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-safe-are-energy-drinks" data-node-id="16" class="body-h2 css-guqo8m emevuu60"&gt;How Safe Are Energy Drinks?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Health officials say that no matter what your caffeinated beverage of choice is, you should consume it in moderation. Dasgupta notes that most healthy adults can safely consume up to 400 mg of caffeine per day without experiencing adverse health effects. “Too much caffeine can lead to jitters, trouble sleeping, a racing heart, and sometimes headaches or an upset stomach,” he says. “In the long run, regularly overdoing it on caffeine can make you dependent on it and need more to get the same boost.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Those with certain health conditions should be especially cautious. “For people &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/just-for-fun/g43784840/best-and-worst-foods-for-anxiety/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.delish.com/just-for-fun/g43784840/best-and-worst-foods-for-anxiety/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="dealing with anxiety" data-node-id="19.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;dealing with anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and other mental issues, caffeine can possibly make the symptoms worse since it stimulates the nervous system. It may also interfere with sleep for those who struggle with it already,” Gervacio says. “People with cardiovascular issues may want to modify their intake or avoid caffeine as it may cause a rise in heart rate and blood pressure.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Antioxidants and added supplements may look appealing on the label, but the high sugar, high caffeine, and preservatives cancel out any other potential benefits—and you can get the same nutrients from whole foods like fruits and vegetables.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“In general, energy drinks are not a ‘healthy’ choice since many are loaded with sugar and artificial stuff, plus high caffeine doses,” Dasgupta says. “Some energy drinks without added sugar can give you a quick energy lift, but natural sources like coffee or &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food/a64443359/coffee-vs-tea-health-benefits/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.delish.com/food/a64443359/coffee-vs-tea-health-benefits/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="tea" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt; are usually better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you &lt;em data-node-id="22.1"&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; choose to enjoy an energy drink, it’s recommended that you read the label closely and keep your total daily caffeine intake in check.

(Courtesy of Chase Johnson)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I am literally doing anything possible to make sure this doesn’t come back,” Johnson said. “For triple negative, the resources are so limited; if the traditional treatment methods don’t work, you’re just kind of out of luck.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The vaccine targets a protein called α-lactalbumin, which is present in about 70% of triple-negative breast cancers and found on the surface of tumor cells. If successful, the vaccine would teach the immune system to make T-cells that attack and destroy cells with the protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The latest findings of the Phase 1 clinical trial, which included 35 women, were presented Thursday at the &lt;a href="https://sabcs.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium&lt;/a&gt; in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The trial looked at whether the vaccine was safe and if it triggered an immune response in three groups of patients. (It did not look at how the vaccine affected outcomes.) The first group, which included Johnson, was women who had recovered from early stage triple-negative breast cancer and were tumor-free but at high risk for recurrence. The second was women who had undergone treatment for early-stage disease and had remaining tumor cells. The third group had not yet been diagnosed with breast cancer, but carried a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/guidelines-say-more-women-may-need-breast-cancer-gene-test-n1044416" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:genetic predisposition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;genetic predisposition&lt;/a&gt;, such as the BRCA gene, that put them at high risk for triple-negative cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The researchers found that 74% of the women developed an immune response to the vaccine — though what that result means for reducing recurrence or preventing disease is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Whether this immune response will translate into reducing the risk of recurrence or preventing breast cancer, we don’t know that yet,” said trial leader Dr. G. Thomas Budd, a breast cancer medical oncologist at Cleveland Clinic’s Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The vaccine also appeared to be safe: Women reported redness or a lump at the injection site, but no serious adverse events were seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One concern was whether the vaccine would trigger an autoimmune response, where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body. Women naturally produce α-lactalbumin when lactating, which the vaccine could train the body to attack. Because of this, Budd said he doesn’t recommend that women who want to breastfeed enroll in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Phase 1 results, while promising, only represent an early step in determining whether the vaccine will prove successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A Phase 2 trial is expected to begin late next year. That trial will be the first to look at whether the vaccine can reduce the risk of a triple-negative breast cancer recurrence. If that goes well, future trials will test prevention in patients with a genetic risk, Budd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Justin Balko, co-leader of the Breast Cancer Research Program at Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, said the most promising use for the vaccine would be to prevent a first cancer occurrence or a recurrence, rather than target lingering cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That’s because over time, tumor cells can learn how to hide target proteins from the immune system, Balko said. New cancer cells are less likely to develop this ability, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vaccine exploration for triple-negative breast cancer is a welcome task, said Dr. Larry Norton, founding medical director of the Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The most effective targeted breast cancer treatments need estrogen or HER2 receptors to be present in tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Triple-negative doesn’t have either, so we are left only with chemotherapy,” Norton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even if the α-lactalbumin-targeting vaccine is not effective in a Phase 2 trial, Norton said scientists are getting better at identifying the abnormal molecules found on different tumor cells. Those abnormalities serve as targets for novel therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There was a time when we would say HER2 is the worst type of breast cancer you can have, then along came HER2-targeting therapies and now all of the sudden one of the worst prognosis markers becomes one of the best,” Norton said. “This could be the story of triple-negative breast cancer if we find a target for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/triple-negative-breast-cancer-vaccine-shows-promise-early-clinical-tri-rcna248672" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NBCNews.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;NBCNews.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 23:00:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOWDd0azdldlNHMnBlZEhqV0lIWU9XOFV2dnhDR3Rxa011Q1hqS291N2k2VWlEd1NYVnUybzRQU1laMlIwU1hqUmEyVF85RjNyRnJRQTJIMGc4bGJNeXVsaHM4Smp4aFJzOE4xYkh4eGVCaHR3a1htUVFucGFuRzNteVVsU0FiUjBHazZKSjRGR3FIQQ</guid></item><item><title>三阴性乳腺癌疫苗在早期临床试验中显示出希望- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/triple-negative-breast-cancer-vaccine-shows-promise-early-clinical-tri-rcna248672</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2718da" class="body-graf"&gt;When Chase Johnson was 31, her dog began acting strange.

If successful, the vaccine would teach the immune system to make T-cells that attack and destroy cells with the protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0bb0ab" class="body-graf"&gt;The latest findings of the Phase 1 clinical trial, which included 35 women, were presented Thursday at the &lt;a href="https://sabcs.org/" target="_blank"&gt;San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium&lt;/a&gt; in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-629f7a" class="body-graf"&gt;The trial looked at whether the vaccine was safe and if it triggered an immune response in three groups of patients. (It did not look at how the vaccine affected outcomes.) The first group, which included Johnson, was women who had recovered from early stage triple-negative breast cancer and were tumor-free but at high risk for recurrence. The second was women who had undergone treatment for early-stage disease and had remaining tumor cells. The third group had not yet been diagnosed with breast cancer, but carried a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/guidelines-say-more-women-may-need-breast-cancer-gene-test-n1044416" target="_blank"&gt;genetic predisposition&lt;/a&gt;, such as the BRCA gene, that put them at high risk for triple-negative cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cfafae" class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers found that 74% of the women developed an immune response to the vaccine — though what that result means for reducing recurrence or preventing disease is still unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-add13c" class="body-graf"&gt;“Whether this immune response will translate into reducing the risk of recurrence or preventing breast cancer, we don’t know that yet,” said trial leader Dr. G. Thomas Budd, a breast cancer medical oncologist at Cleveland Clinic’s Cancer Institute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e87643" class="body-graf"&gt;The vaccine also appeared to be safe: Women reported redness or a lump at the injection site, but no serious adverse events were seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cea253" class="body-graf"&gt;One concern was whether the vaccine would trigger an autoimmune response, where the immune system mistakenly attacks the body. Women naturally produce α-lactalbumin when lactating, which the vaccine could train the body to attack. Because of this, Budd said he doesn’t recommend that women who want to breastfeed enroll in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f1a331" class="body-graf"&gt;The Phase 1 results, while promising, only represent an early step in determining whether the vaccine will prove successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-614604" class="body-graf"&gt;A Phase 2 trial is expected to begin late next year. That trial will be the first to look at whether the vaccine can reduce the risk of a triple-negative breast cancer recurrence. If that goes well, future trials will test prevention in patients with a genetic risk, Budd said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-51565b" class="body-graf"&gt;Justin Balko, co-leader of the Breast Cancer Research Program at Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, said the most promising use for the vaccine would be to prevent a first cancer occurrence or a recurrence, rather than target lingering cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1c283b" class="body-graf"&gt;That’s because over time, tumor cells can learn how to hide target proteins from the immune system, Balko said. New cancer cells are less likely to develop this ability, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-707391" class="body-graf"&gt;Vaccine exploration for triple-negative breast cancer is a welcome task, said Dr. Larry Norton, founding medical director of the Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The most effective targeted breast cancer treatments need estrogen or HER2 receptors to be present in tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4f1e71" class="body-graf"&gt;“Triple-negative doesn’t have either, so we are left only with chemotherapy,” Norton said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d45de1" class="body-graf"&gt;Even if the α-lactalbumin-targeting vaccine is not effective in a Phase 2 trial, Norton said scientists are getting better at identifying the abnormal molecules found on different tumor cells. Those abnormalities serve as targets for novel therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2e75a8" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“There was a time when we would say HER2 is the worst type of breast cancer you can have, then along came HER2-targeting therapies and now all of the sudden one of the worst prognosis markers becomes one of the best,” Norton said. “This could be the story of triple-negative breast cancer if we find a target for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQYzA1Ty1wUGlDUmF1c241Smx1MGh0TVUzYkNvQ2lsRE1seGlwbkQ2VmJjQnM1NDBuazU2YkJwYllhWHRHQjhrSW01Y2ZqTjNycFFoY1ZvSGEwdmhnUTFjbHBxaDhPdGNxSzNhR1E3QlB2YnpLUDcxR1duY0p6Z1p5NW1haGZEOEMtb1FiejBHdmFIQ2E2bFVaMElfOFNkVGJueG9qUHhfS252YmRzOEtQOGptTEdhZW9TcGJB0gFWQVVfeXFMTjgxNXlERU5OMlBkSHk0UlBDUjJQMFBLaTFPUzQ4U19ULXNxNW9BdlRPcDVNSDNTRFZ1aGxRQm1hLTN4OU1yQ3M4TExMOEZWRnAycERxZnc</guid></item><item><title>感冒了？医生警告说，最喜欢的舒适食品可能会让你感觉更糟- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/news/sick-cold-doctors-warn-favorite-130021537.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we approach winter — and all the illnesses that come with this time of year — many Americans are looking for proactive measures to protect their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between loading up on citrus fruits and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eating fresh vegetables,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;eating fresh vegetables,&lt;/a&gt; it's worthwhile to build up a healthy immune system to protect against germs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when you're hit with a cold or the flu, which foods will help you recover — and which ones will make the illness worse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/researchers-say-millions-ditched-bread-no-reason-heres-whats-really-happening" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Researchers Say Millions Ditched Bread For No Reason — Here's What's Really Happening;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Researchers Say Millions Ditched Bread For No Reason — Here's What's Really Happening&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital spoke with medical experts about the worst foods to eat while you're sick — many of which are common choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out four items to avoid — and what to choose instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS/mvaj7wvj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read On The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read On The Fox News App&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Many Americans are seeking ways to stay healthy as flu season kicks into high gear.

Experts urge otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fried and greasy foods "slow gastric emptying, trigger visceral hypersensitivity and promote intestinal inflammation," said Ednie.

		&lt;p&gt;Authorities are looking for a man who moved a rabies-infected raccoon out of a Wells roadway with his bare hands Monday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The raccoon was blocking traffic near the 1900 block of Sanford Road when police say a caller reported that the unidentified man tried to move the animal — first by poking it with a stick, then by picking it up by the scruff of its neck.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Responding officers observed that the raccoon was exhibiting signs of significant health distress, including visible porcupine quills embedded in its face,” the Wells Police Department wrote &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/WellsMainePolice/posts/pfbid02LDqnTdLV7zvALpZDdgXbQFwc3N42XpugjMyYDcsvh5PDfm4EC5QKuWiygEsZq138l" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;in a social media post&lt;/a&gt; Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Wells officer euthanized the raccoon, which later tested positive for rabies, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rabies is a viral disease transmitted through contact with spit or nervous tissue from an infected animal. It affects the brain and spinal cord and can be deadly if left untreated. Rabies cannot be spread by petting animals or touching dried saliva, blood or other bodily fluids.&lt;/p&gt;


	
	


&lt;p&gt;Though rabies in people is rare in the U.S., it is more common among wild animals in Maine, &lt;a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/diseases-conditions/animal-borne-diseases/rabies" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/diseases-conditions/animal-borne-diseases/rabies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;according to the Maine CDC&lt;/a&gt;. Signs of rabies in a wild animal include peculiar behavior, such as unusual tameness or normally nocturnal animals being outside in the daytime.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly 50 cases of rabies have been reported across Maine so far this year, according to state data. Of those cases, 22 were found in raccoons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because the man touched the infected raccoon with his bare hands, Wells police wrote in their post, he may be at risk of exposure and require medical evaluation. Signs and symptoms of having rabies include fever, headache and exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anyone with information about the man’s identity is asked to contact the Wells Police Department at 207-646-9354.&lt;/p&gt;

A spokesperson for HHS declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“We have a men's health crisis in this country. Now we need a national strategy,” Christine said as part of a call for creating so-called Men's Health Centers of Excellence across the country that would collaborate with one another, share information, and generate data to inform policy and programs around men’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Participants in Wednesday’s FDA panel—which included federal health officials, urologists, experts on male sexual health, and the CEO of a TRT pharmaceutical company—voiced support for expanding the eligibility criteria for TRT and removing testosterone from the FDA’s list of controlled substances. Earlier this year the FDA held a similar panel on hormone replacement therapy for menopausal women and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/hhs-advances-womens-health-removes-misleading-fda-warnings-hormone-replacement-therapy"&gt;announced in November&lt;/a&gt; that it would remove a black-box warning from the medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The Trump administration has aggressively canceled equity and transgender initiatives across the government and cut &lt;a class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/health/trump-administration-slashes-research-into-lgbtq-health.html"}' href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/04/health/trump-administration-slashes-research-into-lgbtq-health.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hundreds of millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; in funding for research into women’s and LGBTQ health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;During the panel discussion, Christine called attention to men’s health more broadly, pointing out the widening gender gap in life expectancy in the US and that &lt;a href="https://newsroom.clevelandclinic.org/2023/09/06/cleveland-clinic-survey-examines-the-current-state-of-mens-health-in-america"&gt;44 percent of men&lt;/a&gt; surveyed in 2023 didn’t get an annual physical. While rates of depression are similar among men and women, men are much less likely to seek treatment, despite suicide rates in the US being much higher in men. Substance abuse compounds that problem, he said, with the majority of opioid overdoses &lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/2023/06/men-died-of-overdose-at-2-3-times-greater-a-rate-than-women-in-the-us-in-2020-2021"&gt;occurring in men&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“There are fewer federal programs targeting men's health concerns than women,” Christine said. “None of this suggests that we should back off our commitment to women's health. No—never. But we do need a parallel track for men's health in this country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Christine also couched men’s health concerns, particularly obesity, as a national security issue. “Men's health concerns truly affect defense preparedness, defense readiness, and the safety of this country against our enemies,” he said, adding that obesity is a barrier to serving in the military.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 22:11:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxONk9VUUxRM0ktTy1wNlJsZkZ6OHFTMlI4NFhOQkFGcmVFa25iMkpuQ3BHUjhCc3lOR3FWaW53NnE1MlQtSkVfNF9kUUtYT3FURTF0b0owdm5BNjVMVGdqWXpFYm5sYkZtSDM2dlBVcEhnMUVTSGZ1NFU1SmRkLWFaUTJ0RTJpM0JCeHRnRHptOWJJdUxhekVYaldkUDQ2MkJIeU9J</guid></item><item><title>在与临床医生的通话中， CDC广泛推荐流感疫苗- CIDRAP</title><link>https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-general/call-clinicians-cdc-recommends-flu-vaccines-widely</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) hosted its first Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity (COCA) call since September, focusing on seasonal influenza activity and vaccination, especially the importance of vaccinating children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The time to get vaccinated is right now for those 6 months and older. [Flu] rates are increasing,” said Tim Uyeki, MD, MPH, MPP, the chief medical officer of the Influenza Division at CDC. Uyeki said that last year saw high morbidity and mortality with only moderate flu vaccine efficacy (VE). Most important, he said, there was a significant number of severe flu cases among children, with 288 deaths.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s the highest number of deaths we’ve seen since CDC starting tracking this data,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year the CDC confirmed 37 cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE), a rapid and severe swelling of the brain following infections. Uyeki said, of the 37 patients, only six (16%) were vaccinated against flu, and the average age of ANE patients was 5 years.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANE comes on quickly, within two days of flu symptoms, he explained, and 74% of patients end up admitted to intensive care units. Last year, 15 (41%) of the 37 patients with ANE died.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US dominated by H3N2 activity so far&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uyeki said the United States has not yet seen the swift and early flu activity reported by the United Kingdom and Japan, though, like those countries, flu activity is so far dominated by influenza A(H3N2) subclade K.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have not seen early activity compared to other countries, but cases are now increasing throughout the US.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have not seen early activity compared to other countries, but cases are now increasing throughout the US, and influenza H3N2 is increasing and is being reported,” he said. So far of the H3N2 cases subtyped by the CDC this season, 87% are subclade K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisa A. Grohskopf, MD, MPH, also a medical officer in the CDC’s Influenza Division, emphasized that all children six months and older should be vaccinated, and said flu vaccines formulated without thimerosal are preferred.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32711/HHS-approves-flu-vaccines-without-thimerosal"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thimerosal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a preservative that has been proven safe in countless studies, but it has become a target of anti-vaccine advocates. This summer, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted in favor of using only single-dose influenza vaccines without thimerosal for the current season.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rise in subclade K in some global regions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON586"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In related news&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the World Health Organization (WHO), in a global situation report on seasonal flu yesterday, said subclade K infections are rapidly rising in some countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although global activity remains within expected seasonal ranges, early increases and higher activity than typical at this time of year have been observed in some regions,” the WHO said, noting the rise of subclade K infections.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the CDC official and the WHO said preliminary UK data show that the current seasonal vaccine offers strong protection against subclade K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Early estimates suggest that the influenza vaccine continues to provide protection against hospital attendance in both children and adults, even though its effectiveness against clinical disease during the current season remains uncertain,” the WHO said.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

in over four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.trumbull-ct.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=2959" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;a notice posted to the town website&lt;/a&gt; Thursday, Trumbull officials said the town's administration and the Trumbull Health Department were notified of a confirmed case of measles involving an unvaccinated child under the age of 10 at Christian Heritage School, a private school that teaches students from kindergarten through 12th grade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the town, local health officials are working closely with the school's administration and the Connecticut Department of Public Health to ensure all proper precautions are being taken to ensure the health and well-being of all students, faculty and residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock__MjFe8 ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock--mobile__nW8lf"&gt;&lt;section class="styles_SubscribeForm__h3Jpx"&gt;&lt;h2 class="styles_SubscribeForm__title__k8VOX"&gt;Find out what's happening in Trumbull&lt;span class="styles_SubscribeForm__title--nextLine__xasJy"&gt;for free with the latest updates from Patch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="exco-playerDesktopNative" data-exs-config='{"customParams":{"slot":"exco","user":"false"}}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trumbull health officials will continue to closely monitor the situation and update the community, according to the town.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The town also provided &lt;span class="redactor-unlink"&gt;a letter&lt;/span&gt; sent Thursday to Christian Heritage School parents by the Trumbull Health Department, which is &lt;a href="https://www.trumbull-ct.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=2959" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;available to read in full here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock__MjFe8 ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock--desktop__irxNV"&gt;&lt;section class="styles_SubscribeForm__h3Jpx"&gt;&lt;h2 class="styles_SubscribeForm__title__k8VOX"&gt;Find out what's happening in Trumbull&lt;span class="styles_SubscribeForm__title--nextLine__xasJy"&gt;for free with the latest updates from Patch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the letter, health officials said a member of the school community with measles was present at the school on Dec. 4.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unvaccinated or undervaccinated children and adults, including those who have a medical or other exemption to vaccination, must be excluded from school for 21 days after their most recent exposure, which the letter noted was through Dec. 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents of students who are unvaccinated or undervaccinated will be contacted by the school nursing department, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the letter, measles is a viral infection that spreads through coughing and sneezing and is very contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most school-aged children who are fully vaccinated with two doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine are protected from measles, however three in 100 people who have received two doses of MMR vaccine will still get measles if exposed to the virus, according to the letter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Therefore, we want to provide you with information about measles and the signs and symptoms to look for in your child," the letter reads. "Usually about 8-12 days (but up to 21 days) after exposure, measles begins with a mild to moderate fever accompanied by cough, runny nose and red eyes. Two or three days later, the fever spikes, often as high as 104-105°F. At the same time, a red blotchy rash appears, usually first on the face, along the hairline and behind the ears. The rash rapidly spreads downward to the chest and back and, finally, to the thighs and feet."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the letter, most students with measles are sick enough that they miss at least a week of school. One in every 20 people with measles develops pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More rarely, serious or even life-threatening complications can occur, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"If your child is not in compliance with the MMR requirements, they should receive a dose of MMR vaccine, unless there is a valid, documented medical reason why they cannot receive the vaccine," the letter reads. "We recommend that you contact your healthcare provider for immunization as soon as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For families who do not have a healthcare provider, their child may receive the immunization for a fee by appointment at the Trumbull Health Department, located at 335 White Plains Road, by calling 203-452-1030, according to the letter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"If your child develops an illness with fever (101°F or more), cough, runny nose or red eyes, with or without rash, immediately call your doctor and let them know about your child's exposure and symptoms so that they can tell you what to do next," the letter reads. "Your doctor can make special arrangements to evaluate you, if needed, without putting other patients and medical office staff at risk. Keep your child at home until the doctor and the school staff have cleared him/her to return."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyone with questions is encouraged to call the Trumbull Nursing Department at 203-452-5090 or the Trumbull Health Department at 203-452-1030. More information about measles is available &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;on the CDC website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the state Department of Public Health &lt;a href="https://patch.com/connecticut/across-ct/measles-case-confirmed-ct-heres-everything-you-need-know"&gt;announced a confirmed case of measles&lt;/a&gt; in an unvaccinated Fairfield County child under the age of 10 but did not identify the town where the case was reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the first case of measles in Connecticut in more than four years. Nationwide, more than 1,800 cases of measles have been reported in 2025 — the most since the virus was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000 and the most cases in more than three decades, according to the International Vaccine Access Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the DPH, the child recently traveled internationally and began showing symptoms of measles several days later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those symptoms included cough, runny nose, congestion, fever and eventually a rash starting at the head and spreading throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;See also: &lt;a href="https://patch.com/connecticut/across-ct/measles-case-confirmed-ct-heres-everything-you-need-know"&gt;Measles Case Confirmed In CT: Here's Everything You Need To Know&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, 9 out of 10 unvaccinated individuals who encounter an infected person will become infected with the measles virus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles can be dangerous, especially for children under the age of five. About 1 in 5 unvaccinated people in the U.S. who get measles end up being hospitalized, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles generally begin 7–14 days after the exposure to an infected person. A typical case of measles begins with mild to moderate fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and sore throat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Three to five days after the start of these symptoms, a red or reddish-brown rash appears, usually starting on a person's face at the hairline and spreading downward to the entire body. At the time the rash appears, a person's fever may spike to more than 104 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The single best way to protect your children and yourself from measles is to be vaccinated," DPH Commissioner Manisha Juthani said in a news release. "One dose of measles vaccine is about 93% effective, while two doses are about 97% effective. We must ensure we continue to protect those who matter most — children and other vulnerable people — from vaccine preventable illnesses through on-time vaccination."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DPH, the American Academy of Pediatrics and several other organizations recommend children get two doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the first dose at 12 through 15 months of age, and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A total of 98.2 percent of Connecticut students were vaccinated with two doses of MMR by kindergarten, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state's MMR vaccination rate is the highest in the country, officials said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="styles_HTMLContent__bNPCl SubscribeCTABlurb_SubscribeCTABlurb__5x0v2"&gt;Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox. &lt;a target="_blank" href="/connecticut/trumbull/subscribe" class=""&gt;Sign up for free Patch newsletters and alerts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MuiBox-root css-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 20:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNWnZvemVtVHVJVWFuWUpFYUFqSUhPUlc0cmVrV0FEZEJzc19zWEpCS1NkR2FvTjVVa1ZQRkNXSXBFT3RGb2lNLXFXWFlGQ19SUG44cjlsanRVU205ZFZjaTdPTXRmWWlRalRPNW1GOFo1Y0NxWFFPWV92eXRVUnVEMnV4T0I4UVQ3WDFYd0ozZFIyb3FxWkt4TmdGVdIBsAFBVV95cUxObUVnbTNIdl9GSjA1VkZsN3VXeFFXN1dERGVfVEg4ZjlNSDJPZVVfZXN5b1Rsb2g0My1ScXY3a25fYjY2TmtQNUw0RFR0MnQySjlqOTFpX25PVFpuOWZxTWgtVkIyRjU1czF6dmZadlRFTUxKYk1RNUtqVU4yTms0a3hUNTJZR013eTE3TWlhRXhUWnhXVF9uamdKVEstSkQyQ3FFMVhsS3FtOTk4N0JmWA</guid></item><item><title>家庭警告：一名Farmville中学生患有肺结核- WRAL</title><link>https://www.wral.com/lifestyles/health/tb-tuberculosis-north-carolina-middle-school-december-2025/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Parents in Pitt County were notified this week that a middle school student tested positive for tuberculosis (TB). &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Though there is no immediate public health risk from this exposure, we are investigating the possible exposures and will inform staff and parents/guardians of students who need to be tested to ensure that any potential exposure to TB is identified,” said Pitt County Health Director Wes Gray.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis is a contagious bacterial infection that can be spread when an infected person speaks or coughs. Common symptoms are a cough, chest pain and fatigue. TB can be cured with a course of antibiotics, but recovery can take months.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Staff at Farmville Middle School will test students who are believed to have been exposed to TB, and anyone who tests positive will be able to get free treatment, Gray said.&lt;/p&gt;

Even though he has his kids 50% of the time, the parent who gets support (his ex) is supposed to cover all the normal kid expenses unless the divorce explicitly says otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In his case, OP and his ex are only supposed to split uninsured medical/dental issues and mutually agreed extracurriculars. OP said he provides child support and alimony, and noted that his ex doesn't work.

His ex emailed him to say that she can only afford the party if they split the cost. OP said his ex's ask feels off because it's not something he's obligated to split, and she's financially supported specifically so she can host these types of things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While he said he wants his daughter to have a great birthday, he doesn't think he's supposed to fund things that aren't decreed in the divorce and said that this feels like a "transfer of wealth" if he pays. He asks if he's in the wrong for refusing to pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stock image of a person holding a birthday cake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In his comments, people were mixed over whether or not OP was in the wrong. One person said that in the eyes of the court, OP is not in the wrong — but in the eyes of his daughter, he might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"[In] the eyes of the people don't know you personally and only know the details you have told us, you're NTA." they said. "In the eyes of your daughter who will only be told that you refused to help pay for the party yet you paid for her brother's party, that's a different story. Your ex has you between a rock and a hard place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another agreed with the first person, but said it was probably better to just pay for the party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"NTA. However, your daughter doesn't deserve the consequences of this. I would agree to pay for the party and let your ex-wife know, in no uncertain terms, that it will never happen again," they said. "That if it does, rather than you paying her for half of the party, you will do the party yourself when you have your daughter. And the ex-wife will miss out on the experience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A third said that everyone is in the wrong in this situation since the parents are involving the kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"[Everybody sucks here]. Divorce can be nasty. Especially if there’s a stay home parent involved. But your kids should never pay the price for that," one commenter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"By the sounds of things, your kids are older (paying car insurance means they are at least 16) and you only have a few years left of child support. You can nitpick and fight with your ex wife while your kids suffer the consequences and start to resent you," they continued. "Or you can suck it up for a few years till they’re adults. Given that you clearly aren’t suffering financially, this isn’t taking food off your table, just suck it up and pay it for your kids sake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/divorced-dads-ex-wants-him-to-split-cost-of-their-daughters-birthday-party-11867016" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life UK</author><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2025 19:24:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE9fZnRxYXV2VVR0VUlzb3ZxMnhZdHA5N0s1aXpENWhFalVsZEFqMjl5Z0JsUGFBUDFYdXI2bzJKczNxYUhTMkJTRFVsU0NJV3RtV3lmREJHLURJQ3YxVTRzZGdSb0JoSUtqQ2tuWUxGMmk3cndf</guid></item><item><title>时代杂志部署AI “Ask Me Anything”盒子，掩盖其实际新闻，无法关闭-未来主义</title><link>https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/time-magazine-ai-chatbot</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="article-featured-image-figure"&gt;

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;It may not surprise you that &lt;em&gt;Time &lt;/em&gt;magazine has elected to highlight the AI industry in its annual “Person of the Year” issue. Or should we say persons: the collective billionaire “architects of AI,” it announced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;But what may surprise you is a new feature prominently displayed on &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;‘s website: a window for an AI chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Ask me anything,” it reads.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;It does not go away. Instead, the chatbot window stays fixed to the bottom center of your screen, blocking any text that’s in the way. In fact, depending on the size and resolution of your device’s screen, it completely blots out the home page’s featured headline — including today’s much-discussed article, “&lt;a href="https://time.com/7339685/person-of-the-year-2025-ai-architects/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Person of the Year 2025: The Architects of AI&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;There’s no x-button to close the AI window, and as far as we can tell, no other means of swatting it away. If you click in the text box, it expands to filling the entire page. Call it an ironic metaphor for the tech and AI’s industry capturing of news and media, if you want. It’s also just plain annoying.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Emily M. Bender, a computational linguistics expert at the University of Washington and author of the book “The AI Con,” &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/emilymbender.bsky.social/post/3m7psa3eun223" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;complained&lt;/a&gt; about the intrusive AI feature on social media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Any journalistic outfit that values the work of their journalists wouldn’t offer to present it as papier-mâché,” Bender said of the AI chatbot, “and certainly wouldn’t put that offer in the way of the other bit of journalism their audience might be trying to read.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/11/10/time-ai-agent-ask" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;unveiled&lt;/a&gt; the AI in late November, though apparently without much fanfare. It’s not merely an AI chatbot, it insists, but an AI &lt;em&gt;agent&lt;/em&gt; — meaning it’s supposed to be autonomous — and trained on the magazine’s 102-year-old archive of nearly 750,000 magazine issues, web articles, and other assets, generating summaries, audio rundowns, and answers to user questions. It was built in partnership with Scale AI, a &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-industry-traumatizing-contractors"&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt; data annotation company whose services are &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/scale-ai-zuckerberg-incompetence"&gt;essential to the generative AI industry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“People spend hours and hours with agents, and hopefully this means that they will spend a lot more time with our journalism,” &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief Sam Jacobs &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/11/10/time-ai-agent-ask" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after its unveiling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The “TimeAI” agent wasn’t featured on the magazine’s homepage at launch, which is perhaps why it flew under the radar until now. This, however, is not &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;‘s first stab at experimenting with AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;When it crowned Donald Trump as Person of the Year in 2024, &lt;em&gt;Time &lt;/em&gt;used the announcement to &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/12/12/time-inc-ai-chatbot-person-year" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;unveil&lt;/a&gt; what in retrospect seems a prototype of the AI we’re presented with today, also built with Scale AI. One sign of progress, or at least shifting industry trends? It merely called its predecessor an AI chatbot, and not an “agent.” It’s not yet clear how the new AI is supposed to be agentic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Certainly &lt;em&gt;Time &lt;/em&gt;isn’t the only newsroom picking up AI. Outlets like &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; have some form of AI that provides a summary of articles or answers questions, though neither are as intrusive as &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;‘s. The &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/reader-center/how-new-york-times-uses-ai-journalism.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;uses it to generate headlines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;WaPo &lt;/em&gt;is particularly AI obsessed: it’s considered &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/washington-post-ai-articles"&gt;using an AI to help non-professional write entire articles&lt;/a&gt; that could be published in the paper, and is now &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/disaster-washington-post-ai-generated-podcast"&gt;launching an AI-generated podcast service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In two months, 111 people have been sickened by the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-vaccines-autism-measles-obesity-food-dye-f26089856550e978d28fd25b653d8103"&gt;vaccine-preventable virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 250 people, including students from nine area elementary, middle and high schools, are in quarantine — some for the second time since the outbreak began in October. Most of the state’s new cases stemmed from exposures at Way of Truth Church in Inman. Church leaders have been “very helpful,” said state epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are faced with ongoing transmission that we anticipate will go on for many more weeks, at least in our state,” said Bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Arizona and Utah, an outbreak has ballooned since &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.mohave.gov/news-notices/posts/measles-case-within-mohave-county-along-the-arizona-utah-border-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;August&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Mohave County, Arizona has logged 172 cases and the Southwest Utah Public Health Department has logged 82 cases. The border cities of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah, are the heaviest hit.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Utah has confirmed 115 measles cases this year. Arizona has confirmed 176.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nationally, the measles case count is nearing 2,000 for a disease that has been &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c"&gt;considered eliminated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the U.S. since 2000, a result of routine childhood vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/canada-loses-measles-elimination-status-1ac3a4bdc7546fac5d8e111bf5196e1e"&gt;Canada lost that designation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — which applies when there is no continuous local spread of the virus — as did the larger health region of the Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Experts say the U.S. is also at risk of losing that status. For that to happen, measles would have to spread continuously for a year. A large outbreak in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-vaccine-outbreak-texas-mmr-0744a165cfb354022092a1f158c698b0"&gt;Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that started in January sickened nearly 900 and kicked off the United States’ worst measles year in more than three decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All but eight states have logged at least one measles case this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has confirmed 47 outbreaks this year, compared with 16 in 2024.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is already known about this topic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2024, CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months to provide additional protection against severe COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is added by this report?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During August 29, 2024–September 2, 2025, within a multisite network including nine states, vaccine effectiveness of 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccination was an estimated 76% against COVID-19–associated emergency department or urgent care (ED/UC) visits among immunocompetent children aged 9 months–4 years and an estimated 56% among children and adolescents aged 5–17 years, compared with those who did not receive a 2024–2025 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the implications for public health practice?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a population with some persons having preexisting levels of protection from previous vaccination, previous infection, or both, 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccination provided children with additional protection against COVID-19–associated ED/UC encounters compared with no 2024–2025 vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="abstract" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Abstract"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During September 2023–August 2024, approximately 38,000 COVID-19–associated hospitalizations occurred among children and adolescents aged &amp;lt;18 years in the United States, a rate of approximately 53 per 100,000 children, ranging from 600 per 100,000 children aged &amp;lt;6 months to 21 per 100,000 children and adolescents aged 5–17 years. On June 27, 2024, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that all persons aged ≥6 months receive a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine, which targeted Omicron JN.1 and JN.1-derived sublineages. Investigators used a test-negative case-control design to estimate vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccines against COVID-19–associated emergency department or urgent care (ED/UC) visits during August 29, 2024–September 2, 2025, among immunocompetent children aged 9 months–4 years and children and adolescents aged 5–17 years in the CDC-funded Virtual SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, and Other respiratory viruses Network (VISION), a multisite electronic health record–based network in nine states. Among children aged 9 months–4 years, VE against COVID-19–associated ED/UC visits was estimated at 76% (95% CI = 58%–87%) during the first 7–179 days after vaccination. Among children and adolescents aged 5&lt;b&gt;–&lt;/b&gt;17 years, VE against COVID-19–associated ED/UC visits was an estimated 56% (95% CI = 35%–70%) during the first 7–179 days after vaccination. These findings suggest that vaccination with a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose provided children with additional protection against COVID-19–associated ED/UC encounters compared with no 2024–2025 dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="introduction" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Introduction"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2020, COVID-19 has accounted for thousands of hospitalizations and hundreds of deaths in the United States each season, including approximately 38,000 hospitalizations among children and adolescents aged &amp;lt;18 years during September 2023–August 2024 (&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;). During 2024, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron JN.1 and JN.1-derived lineages predominated and were genomically divergent from the XBB lineages on which the 2023–2024 COVID-19 vaccines were based.* On June 27, 2024, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccines for persons aged ≥6 months (&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;); 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccines became available on August 22, 2024.&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; For previously unvaccinated immunocompetent children aged 6 months–4 years, a multidose initial series (including 3 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or 2 doses of Moderna vaccine) was recommended; a single 2024–2025 dose was recommended for those who completed an initial series. For immunocompetent children aged ≥5 years, a single 2024–2025 dose was recommended, regardless of vaccination history&lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;). Per an announcement from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule was updated in May 2025 to indicate shared clinical decision-making&lt;sup&gt;¶&lt;/sup&gt; for COVID-19 vaccination for healthy children and adolescents aged 6 months–17 years.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This analysis estimated 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19–associated emergency department or urgent care (ED/UC) encounters in children aged 9 months–4 years and children and adolescents aged 5–17 years during August 29, 2024–September 2, 2025. Age 9 months rather than 6 months was the youngest age included to allow time for completion of the Pfizer-BioNTech initial series in children aged 6 months.&lt;sup&gt;††&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="methods" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Methods"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Data Source&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Virtual SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, and Other respiratory viruses Network (VISION) is a multisite electronic health record (EHR)–based network including ED/UCs and hospitals in nine states used to estimate VE. Methods for VE analyses in both adult and pediatric populations within VISION have been described (&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;–&lt;i&gt;6&lt;/i&gt;). In VISION VE analyses, eligible encounters at participating health care systems are those among patients who have received molecular testing (e.g., real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction) or antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2 during the 10 days before or ≤72 hours after an eligible ED/UC encounter or hospital admission for COVID-19–like illness.&lt;sup&gt;§§&lt;/sup&gt; This analysis included encounters among eligible immunocompetent children and adolescents aged 9 months–17 years who visited a participating ED/UC during August 29, 2024–September 2, 2025. COVID-19 vaccination history is ascertained from state or jurisdictional registries, EHRs, and, in a subset of sites, medical claims data.&lt;sup&gt;¶¶&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Data Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eligible encounters from seven participating health care systems, including 256 ED/UCs, during August 29, 2024–September 2, 2025, were included. Case-patients were those with an ED/UC encounter for COVID-19–like illness and receipt of a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular or antigen test result; control patients were those with an ED/UC encounter for COVID-19–like illness and receipt of a negative SARS-CoV-2 molecular test result.***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children were excluded from analyses if they received a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose &amp;lt;7 days before their index date&lt;sup&gt;†††&lt;/sup&gt; or received a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose &amp;lt;2 months after receiving any previous COVID-19 vaccine dose, unless part of an initial series. COVID-19 case-patients were also excluded if they received a positive test result for influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus at the time of their SARS-CoV-2 ED/UC encounter. To reduce bias from overlapping vaccination patterns, control patients who received a positive or indeterminant influenza test result were excluded from the primary analysis (&lt;i&gt;7&lt;/i&gt;). Previous SARS-CoV-2 infections are incompletely documented in medical records; therefore, children were included regardless of previous SARS-CoV-2 infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary VE analyses were conducted by age groups 9 months–4 years and 5–17 years due to differences in the recommended COVID-19 vaccination schedule. In primary VE analyses, children aged 9 months–4 years were considered vaccinated if they completed an initial series with at least 1 2024–2025 dose as part of that series or completed an initial series and then received a 2024–2025 dose as an additional vaccine. The 9 months–4 years comparator group comprised children who had completed the initial COVID-19 vaccine series but had not received a 2024–2025 dose or had no recorded COVID-19 vaccination. Children aged 9 months–4 years with an incomplete initial series were excluded from the primary analysis to assess the ACIP-recommended schedule for this age group. A sensitivity analysis among children aged 9 months–4 years compared children who received at least 1 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose with children who did not, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination history. Among children and adolescents aged 5–17 years, primary VE analyses compared those who received a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose with those who did not, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination history. Results were also stratified by age groups of 5–11 years and 12–17 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were estimated using multivariable logistic regression, comparing persons who received a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose with those who did not among case-patients and control patients, as described in this report. Models were adjusted a priori for age in years, race and ethnicity, sex, calendar day (days since August 29, 2024, to account for variability in COVID-19 circulation), and geographic region with age and calendar day included as natural splines.&lt;sup&gt;§§§&lt;/sup&gt; VE was calculated as (1 − adjusted OR) x 100% during the first 7–179 days since receipt of the most recent 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose. Sensitivity analyses in both the 9 months–4 years and 5–17 years age groups examined VE during the 7–299 days since receipt of a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.3.2; R Foundation). This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.&lt;sup&gt;¶¶¶&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="results" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Results"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;2024–2025 COVID-19 VE Against COVID-19–Associated ED/UC Visits in Children Aged 9 Months–4 Years&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among children aged 9 months–4 years, 44,541 ED/UC encounters met criteria for inclusion in the analyses, including 1,292 (3%) case-patients and 43,249 (97%) control patients (&lt;a id="T1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#T1_down"&gt;Table 1&lt;/a&gt;). Twelve (&amp;lt;1%) case-patients and 1,847 (4%) control patients had received a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose. Effectiveness of a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccination against a COVID-19–associated ED/UC visit was 76% (95% CI = 58%–87%) during the first 7–179 days after vaccination and 77% (95% CI = 62%–86%) during the first 7–299 days after vaccination (&lt;a id="T2_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#T2_down"&gt;Table 2&lt;/a&gt;). VE point estimates were lower at 66% when the comparator group was expanded to include children with an incomplete initial COVID-19 vaccination series, but CIs overlapped with those in the primary analysis (95% CI = 51%–76%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;2024–2025 COVID-19 VE Against COVID-19–Associated ED/UC Visits in Children and Adolescents Aged 5–17 Years&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among children and adolescents aged 5–17 years, 53,467 ED/UC encounters met criteria for inclusion in the analyses, including 1,325 (2%) case-patients and 52,142 (98%) control patients (Table 1). Twenty-six (2%) case-patients and 2,462 (5%) control patients had received a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose. Effectiveness of a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccination against a COVID-19–associated ED/UC visit was 56% (95% CI = 35%–70%) during the first 7–179 days after vaccination, and 45% (95% CI = 25%–59%) during the first 7–299 days after vaccination (&lt;a id="T3_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#T3_down"&gt;Table 3&lt;/a&gt;). Results were similar when stratified by age (51% among children aged 5–11 years and 61% among children and adolescents aged 12–17 years, with overlapping CIs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="discussion" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Discussion"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccines provided protection against COVID-19–associated ED/UC encounters among children and adolescents aged 9 months–17 years. This evaluation included children and adolescents with varied COVID-19 vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection histories, and therefore, results should be interpreted as estimates of the additional protection provided by a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine in a population with mixed preexisting immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infants aged 6–11 months have the highest rates of COVID-19–associated hospitalization of any COVID-19 vaccine–eligible pediatric age group, and COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates in the United States during the 2024–25 respiratory virus season were higher in this group than all adult age groups other than those aged ≥65 years (&lt;i&gt;8&lt;/i&gt;), underscoring potential benefits of COVID-19 vaccination in eligible infants. In this analysis, VE was highest in children aged 9 months–4 years, although CIs overlapped with older age groups. The apparent higher VE in younger children might be due to lower rates of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.**** The primary estimates for VE in this analysis were similar to or higher than 2024–2025 VE estimates for adults in the United States (&lt;i&gt;9&lt;/i&gt;); estimates were also similar to or higher than those for 2023–2024 in children (35% [95% CI = 16%–49%] for children aged 9 months–4 years and 44% [95% CI = 29%–55%] for children and adolescents aged 5–17 years) (&lt;i&gt;6&lt;/i&gt;). Higher estimates for the 2024–25 season might be due to different patterns of recent previous SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the 2023–24 season or might be due to fewer changes in circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants during the 2024–25 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination based on shared clinical decision-making is individually based and guided by a decision process between the health care provider and the patient or parent/guardian; generally, ACIP recommendations adopted by CDC and listed on CDC immunization schedules, including those based on shared clinical decision-making, are covered by health insurance plans. The impact that shifting from universal to shared clinical decision-making (otherwise known as individual-based decision-making) will have on COVID-19 vaccination coverage or effectiveness in children is unclear, underscoring the importance of continued monitoring of COVID-19 VE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, although case-patients met a COVID-19–like illness definition and received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, they might have visited ED/UCs for reasons other than COVID-19, potentially lowering VE estimates. Second, misclassification of vaccination status was possible, which would likely result in underestimation of VE if the misclassification was nondifferential. Previous estimates across networks including various COVID-19 vaccine history ascertainment methods (i.e., EHR, immunization information systems, self-report, and claims data) have yielded similar VE estimates (&lt;i&gt;9&lt;/i&gt;). Third, children aged 9 months–4 years and children and adolescents aged 5–17 years account for a smaller fraction of the general population than adults in age groups frequently examined in VE analyses (i.e., 18–64 years and ≥65 years), decreasing the sample size available for estimating VE in children and adolescents compared with adults. In addition, because of relatively low COVID-19 vaccination coverage in children compared with adults and overall lower rates of medically attended COVID-19 during 2024–2025 compared with 2023–2024, this study did not have sufficient statistical power to measure VE by finer intervals of time since dose and for hospitalization. Fourth, although analyses were adjusted for some relevant confounders, residual confounding from other factors, such as behavioral modifications to prevent SARS-CoV-2 exposure and outpatient antiviral treatment for COVID-19, might remain. Finally, low COVID-19 vaccination coverage among children and adolescents might reduce the generalizability of results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Implications for Public Health Practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this analysis, receipt of a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose provided additional protection against COVID-19–associated ED/UC visits among children and adolescents aged 9 months–17 years in a population with preexisting levels of protection from previous vaccination, previous infection, or both. CDC continues to monitor VE of COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

* VE was calculated as (1 − adjusted odds ratio) × 100%, estimated using a test-negative case-control design, and adjusted for age in years, race and ethnicity, sex, calendar day (days since August 29, 2024), and geographic region with age and calendar day included as natural splines.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; In the primary VE and extended VE analyses, the vaccinated group was children who completed an initial series with ≥1 2024–2025 dose as part of the series or who completed an initial series and then received a 2024–2025 dose as an additional vaccine. The comparator group was children who completed an initial COVID-19 vaccine series with no receipt of a 2024–2025 dose or with no recorded COVID-19 vaccinations. Children aged 9 months–4 years with an incomplete initial series were excluded from the primary analysis. Among vaccinated children aged 9 months–4 years, the initial series and 2024–2025 dose were not required to be from the same manufacturer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt; The extended VE analysis included 44,889 total encounters, of which 1,295 (3%) involved case-patients.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;¶&lt;/sup&gt; In this sensitivity VE analysis, the vaccinated group was children who received at least 1 2024–2025 dose, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination history; the comparator group was children with no receipt of a 2024–2025 dose, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination history. This analysis included 47,343 total encounters, of which 1,344 (3%) involved case-patients.&lt;/p&gt;

* VE was calculated as (1 – adjusted odds ratio) × 100%, estimated using a test-negative case-control design, and age in years, race and ethnicity, sex, calendar day (days since August 29, 2024), and geographic region with age and calendar day included as natural splines. In each analysis, the vaccinated group was children who received at least 1 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose, regardless of previous COVID-19 vaccination history; the comparator group was children with no receipt of a 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose, regardless of previous COVID-19 vaccination history.&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;An Idaho man who died of rabies passed the virus to another man through a kidney transplant, marking the fourth known instance in the country in nearly half a century where rabies was transmitted from an organ donor to a recipient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7439a1.htm#F1_down" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;reported Dec. 4&lt;/a&gt; that the Idaho man was in an outbuilding on his rural property in October 2024 when he was approached by a skunk behaving aggressively. He figured it was because he was holding a kitten, according to the report, which does not identify the man or where he resided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He fought off the skunk, rendering it unconscious, and walked away with a scratch on his shin that bled. But he didn’t think he’d been bitten, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks later, the man started experiencing hallucinations. He also had a stiff neck, confusion and difficulty swallowing and walking. Two days after his symptoms appeared, he was found unresponsive at home. He was resuscitated and taken to a hospital, but he never regained consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After five days in a hospital, he was declared brain dead and removed from life support. His left kidney, heart, lungs and both corneas were recovered for donation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His kidney went to a man from Michigan, who received the transplant at a hospital in Ohio. Five weeks later, the man started experiencing tremors, confusion, urinary incontinence and weakness in his legs. He was hospitalized with fever, difficulty swallowing and an extreme fear of water. Clinicians suspected he had rabies, and several samples were sent to the CDC for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a week at the hospital, the Michigan man died. Local public health officials interviewed his family, who reported that he had not been exposed to any animals. But the testing showed evidence of rabies in his saliva, skin and brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s when the CDC, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and an Idaho public health district began investigating the donor as the source. Health officials tested the Idaho man’s right kidney, which had not been donated, and detected a rabies variant linked to silver-haired bats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, three other patients, one each from Idaho, California and New Mexico, received ocular grafts prepared from the Idaho man’s recovered corneas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As officials investigated the donor’s rabies status, the cornea recipients had their grafts removed as a precaution and received post-exposure prophylaxis, a medication taken after potential exposure to rabies to prevent infection. Rabies is almost always fatal without that medication, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cornea recipients remained asymptomatic. Another corneal graft transplant planned for a Missouri patient was canceled. Later, the CDC detected rabies in one of the previously implanted grafts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is excluded from routine donor pathogen testing in the U.S. because of its rarity in humans and the complexity of diagnostic testing, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7439a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;the report&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, hospital staff who treated the Idaho man were initially unaware of the skunk scratch and attributed his symptoms to chronic comorbidities. After rabies was suspected in the Michigan man, a biopsy that had previously been collected from the donor on his third day at the hospital was revisited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare did not immediately respond to a request for details about the Idaho man, including where he lived in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Epidemiologist Dr. Christine Hahn co-authored the CDC report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;________&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
