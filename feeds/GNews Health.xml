It is part of sweeping changes to childhood immunizations by the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, which have global repercussions – including cutting funding for programs that bring vaccines to countries around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“He has a fixed, immutable belief that vaccines cause harm,” said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “He will do everything he can to try and prove that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The actions taken this year by Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, have “a global impact”, said Elizabeth Jacobs, professor emerita at the University of Arizona and a founding member of the grassroots group Defend Public Health. “It is spreading like an infection all its own throughout the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ac53fa77-3147-4904-b1aa-a83868a3b251" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"CDC ends recommendation for all US newborns to receive hepatitis B vaccine","elementId":"ac53fa77-3147-4904-b1aa-a83868a3b251","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/hepatitis-b-vaccine-cdc"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Testing established vaccines in a country with high rates of hepatitis B and a fragile health system “reeks of a neocolonialist attitude” and risks expanding global mistrust of the US and science, said Gavin Yamey, professor of global health at the Duke Global Health Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When Kennedy announced in June that the US would end funding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which has vaccinated more than 1.2 billion children and saved an estimated 20.6 million lives, he sent shock waves through global health – and he cited an unusual study from 2018 to justify the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2018.00079/full" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; made an alarming claim: the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine caused death in young girls in Guinea-Bissau. It was published by a group of Danish researchers, including a married couple named Peter Aaby and Christine Stabell Benn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But when Kennedy made his announcement in 2025, he did not mention a 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X21007209" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; from some of the same authors on the same topic finding completely different results, essentially nullifying the first study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We did not find that early-DTP was associated with increased female mortality as found in a previous study,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is one example of their questionable research, which has drawn criticism from other researchers and journalists examining their findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Now those same researchers will be the ones carrying out the new study on hepatitis B vaccination in Guinea-Bissau. US funding will go to the &lt;a href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Bandim Health Project&lt;/a&gt;, led by Aaby and Stabell Benn, at the University of Southern Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Aaby and Stabell Benn did not respond to the Guardian’s inquiries about the details of the five-year study, set to begin in early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Babies in the randomized, controlled trial will or will not receive the hepatitis B vaccine at birth. Researchers will then compare early-life mortality, illness and development between the groups, according to the &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-23245.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;award announcement&lt;/a&gt; from the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-b" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; giving the vaccine to all babies at birth, but Guinea-Bissau has struggled to roll out the shots to every newborn, instead &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tmi.14045#:~:text=Examples%20of%20risk%2Dfactors%20of,Bissau%20between%202005%20and%202007." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommending&lt;/a&gt; the dose at six weeks of age. The country has pledged to fill that gap and plans on recommending hepatitis B vaccines to all newborns in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is a major breach of scientific ethics to withhold an intervention that has been proven safe and effective. “It’s highly unethical to choose to give a vaccine to some children but not others,” Offit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yamey noted: “There’s already an RCT [randomized, controlled trial] showing superior outcomes with the birth dose, so why is another one needed?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study does not appear to be looking at whether the vaccine is more effective at birth, which Jacobs said was “concerning” as “nowhere in this do they say that they’re going to study the efficacy of the vaccine itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, the trial will examine whether there are “overall health effects” – not specific outcomes, such as preventing infection from the virus – when the shot is given at birth, &lt;a href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Bandim Health Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This announcement has set alarm bells ringing in the global health community,” said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, calling it a symptom of “a policy desperately searching for evidence”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It is not clear what the research question is. It seems to be about the safety of the vaccine rather than its effectiveness, but both are already well-established, and to undertake such a study in a population where almost one in five of the adult population has a marker of infection seems extremely risky,” McKee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He also questioned whether participants could truly give informed consent, given the ethical concerns about how the study is being conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a recent survey, about 18% of Bissau-Guinean adults had hepatitis B, a virus that can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer, especially among young children. If a baby is infected in the first year of life, there is a 90% chance they will develop cirrhosis or liver cancer; between the ages of one and five, there is a 25% chance. Among adults, about 5% have a chronic infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39187275/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of toddlers in Guinea-Bissau, about 11.2% already had hepatitis B infection, which means not enough babies are getting the shots, said Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity and director of the Oxford Vaccine Group at the University of Oxford. Across sub-Saharan Africa, only about 17% of babies receive the recommended birth dose, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The priority should be to increase vaccination with the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and protect more babies from the risk posed by this virus,” Pollard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the US, recommending the vaccine at birth to all babies – not just those who appeared to be at risk of infection – caused rates among children to drop precipitously, from 20,000 to about 20 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We virtually eliminated hepatitis B in children less than 10,” Offit said. Children may be infected at birth, but they may also come into contact with other children and adults carrying the virus – which can remain infectious on surfaces for up to a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The experts voiced concerns about how the study would take place. It is unusual for a trial like this to take place in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/guinea-bissau" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Guinea-Bissau&lt;/a&gt; instead of the United States or Denmark, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Why on Earth is this study happening in a high-endemic setting where the birth dose matters the most?” Yamey asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In Denmark, where only &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36221255/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;three in 1,000&lt;/a&gt; people have the virus, the shot is not currently recommended at birth either, which means the same study could be conducted there. Denmark also has health registries, making it easier to access complete medical records. Instead, by working in a country with precarious healthcare and high rates of the illness, studies like this may lead to “expanding distrust in global public health”, Jacobs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The US canceled much of its global aid and research earlier this year, Jacobs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In the face of the US canceling all this funding for vulnerable countries, and then it’s still going to pay for this research to be done – that is really worrying,” she said. “It seems to say we don’t value your lives enough to continue to provide support overall, but we won’t hesitate to experiment with your population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study is single-blinded, which means the patients will not know who got the vaccine and who didn’t, but the research team will – which can affect the way they collect and interpret the data. “This means they can stamp their own biases on the results,” Yamey said. And the endpoints – “overall health effects” – are “very squishy”, which leaves the results vulnerable to manipulation, Jacobs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Henrik Støvring, a professor of statistics and pharmacometrics at Aarhus University who co-wrote about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X25012344?via%3Dihub" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;red flags&lt;/a&gt; in Bandim Health Project research for the journal Vaccine this month, said “broad hypotheses like these carry a high risk of false positive findings, and in general the research group has previously been reluctant to use appropriate statistical methods to curb such a risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think conflicts of interests are always an issue when the donor so explicitly seeks out a research group and funds a study,” Støvring said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Danish journalist Gunver Lystbæk Vestergård has also &lt;a href="https://www.weekendavisen.dk/samfund/et-daarligt-immunforsvar" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about major issues with research conducted by Aaby and Stabell Benn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After the CDC sparked outrage by changing the recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination with no evidence, Jacobs said, “they’re now funding this to try to give themselves cover for having done that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Because &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt; is an anti-vaccine zealot, he will somehow contort that study to look like the hepatitis B birth dose causes harm” or that it is better to delay the shots, Offit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Scientists, doctors and medical organizations are speaking out against Kennedy, he said, but “this is a political problem, and it requires a political solution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the meantime, children will bear the brunt of these decisions, Offit continued: “This breaks my heart. It really does. It’s hard to sleep knowing that children are constantly being put in harm’s way by the administration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPMklZRDZ3YzROa0xGdVdzQkJlLXA4U0hTV3F6S0pCSUZURTF0WFlvdUNpZ2ZUN3ZHQXNvaWlOZnRQV2dMYnlYaWFkSlQ0R1BIVEIwTDdLczRTRk1EX1ZsV05iMWpKSHduVjN4ZlF2WXZKLW1VeW0yRWg2SkU4TTgyRnJCdnhsaVA3THFNVkszSVpHRWpxRUE</guid></item><item><title>HHS将全面调整儿童疫苗接种时间表，以推荐更少的疫苗接种- NewsNation</title><link>https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/hhs-childhood-vaccines-recommend-fewer-shots/</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy everyday habits after a meal can help you manage your blood sugar. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take a short walk, drink water and add post-meal fiber to help lessen a rise in blood sugar. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More healthy habits include smoking cessation, daily movement and better sleep quality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s not just what you eat that can influence your blood sugar—but what you do after a meal too. Certain small post-meal actions can reduce spikes, prevent crashes, improve energy and support overall metabolic health. These don’t replace medication, so if you have diabetes, talk to your doctor about treatment strategies needed to stabilize your blood sugar. Here are three practical things dietitians recommend doing after eating for better blood sugar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 1. Take a 10-Minute Walk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Light movement after eating is one of the best ways to blunt your body’s blood sugar response to a meal. “Walking after eating is effective because it helps your body use the glucose from your meal right away, instead of letting it build up in your bloodstream,” says diabetes educator &lt;a href="https://www.amysnutritionkitchen.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amy Kimberlain, M.S., RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, she points out, exercise also diverts blood flow away from the intestines, lessening glucose absorption. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research supports the idea of heading out for a short walk. One small study found that a 10-minute walk right after eating effectively lowered blood glucose levels in healthy young adults better than a control group who rested instead.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Plus, the effects of a 10-minute walk were similar to a 30-minute walk, so researchers recommend the shorter stroll for being more practical for daily life. And in research involving people with type 2 diabetes, physical activity done right after a meal is also effective in lowering blood sugar—and may be a sound strategy for improving long-term blood sugar management.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Can’t get outside? That’s OK. Move around your home, whether that’s light housework, clearing the table or doing the dishes, recommends &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/grace-a-derocha" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Grace Derocha, RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Personally, she saves her laundry for after a meal, which gives her a task that requires going up and down the stairs. That’s a great idea, too, as one study found that one to three minutes of stair climbing improved after-meal insulin and glucose levels.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 2. Drink Water &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drink up after a meal—but make it water. Ideally, you’ll also be drinking water throughout the meal, too. “Drinking water can help, but it won’t stop a spike on its own—it’s more of a gentle support strategy than a powerful intervention like walking,” says Kimberlain. Hydration helps by assisting your kidneys in removing excess glucose from the bloodstream, she explains. Staying hydrated helps to maintain normal blood volume, which is also impactful for blood sugar levels. “Drinking water dilutes the concentration and supports more stable numbers,” Kimberlain says.&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 3. Add a Healthy Fruit Dessert &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You finished your main meal—now what? “I recommend adding a ‘finishing fiber or fruit,’” recommends Derocha. “Certain foods that we eat can support a smoother glucose response, as well as digestion.” She recommends having a high-fiber fruit (such as berries) or fiber-rich dessert (such as chia seed pudding). Fiber helps slow down the absorption of carbohydrate foods from the meal.&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And sometimes you just need a little something sweet to tell you that you’re done. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re not into sweet, finishing the dinner with a fermented food like kimchi is another idea, says Derocha. Fermented foods may help regulate glucose metabolism, and their probiotic properties aid in digestion and reduce inflammation.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Other Everyday Habits for Healthy Blood Sugar Levels &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Follow these tips throughout the day to keep blood sugar levels in check:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on fiber: &lt;/strong&gt;One of the simplest things you can do to reduce spikes is eat more fiber, says Kimberlain. Doing so helps prevent glucose from entering your bloodstream quickly. Ultimately, higher-fiber meals will keep after-meal glucose levels steadier, she says. Oatmeal with berries, beans in a salad, and quinoa, farro and sweet potatoes at dinner are all examples of fiber-rich options.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a balanced plate: &lt;/strong&gt;When planning your meals, complex carbohydrates, lean protein, healthy fats and fiber are an ideal combination for healthy blood sugar, says Kimberlain. Plus, this type of plate also helps keep you full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat foods in order. &lt;/strong&gt;“The order that we eat food can help impact the glucose response in the body,” says Derocha.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To blunt a rise in blood sugar after a meal, the most powerful thing you can do is take a short, 10-minute walk right after eating. In addition, hydrating during and after the meal, as well as chasing the meal with a high-fiber fruit, can also help decrease the rise in glucose that happens after eating, as well as support your body’s ability to get rid of glucose. Blood sugar management is an all-day thing, though, so remember to eat balanced meals containing fiber-rich carbohydrates, lean protein and healthy fat, exercise regularly and get good sleep.

Cardinal lives in a town in British Columbia with strong counter-cultural roots. “The community that I live in, home birth is something a lot of women prioritise,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Then Cardinal stumbled across a podcast from the Free Birth Society (FBS). One episode in particular, she says, made an impact: “Unpacking Ultrasound With Yolande Clark.” In it, the Canadian ex-doula Yolande Norris-Clark falsely links ultrasounds to autism and ADHD and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_t0fi47M7o" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;states that&lt;/a&gt; “ultrasound damages and modifies and destroys cells”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="095cc2d4-a2ab-4c92-b82c-76b24583258a" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Yolande Norris-Clark in an episode of The Complete Guide to Freebirth.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: FBS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Norris-Clark, who was born in Vancouver, is arguably the most famous freebirth influencer in the world. She is also a key figure in FBS, a US company run by her business partner and fellow ex-doula Emilee Saldaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;FBS, which promotes an extreme version of free birth in which women abandon any form of prenatal care and give birth without doctors or midwives present, is estimated to have generated more than $13m in revenues since 2018. A &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/nov/22/free-birth-society-linked-to-babies-deaths-investigation" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent Guardian investigation&lt;/a&gt; identified 48 cases of late-term stillbirths or neonatal deaths or other forms of serious harm involving mothers or birth attendants who appear to be linked to FBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The intellectual heft behind FBS, Norris-Clark shaped the organisation’s radical position on birth, while Saldaya, its founder, runs the business. Most women find FBS through its Instagram account, which has 132,000 followers, or podcast, which has been downloaded 5m times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But Norris-Clark is a significant social media influencer in her own right, pioneering a radical version of free birth that concerns even pro-freebirth advocates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a05cf2da-67e1-4f89-ad4b-0f8d06538477" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Emma Cardinal: ‘You can’t just post about the good side of free birth. What happens when it goes very wrong?’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Annika Faith&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After listening to the podcast about ultrasounds, Cardinal was alarmed. “I was petrified of miscarriage and stillbirth,” she says, explaining that her younger brother was stillborn. “There’s not a chance I’m risking that.” Cardinal came to believe ultrasounds “aren’t super safe for the baby”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At that stage, Cardinal had not yet decided to freebirth. She phoned a local midwifery practice and explained that she wanted a home birth, but did not want to have any ultrasounds during her pregnancy. But the receptionist, Cardinal recalls, said that if she wanted to give birth with them, ultrasounds were non-negotiable. Cardinal thought about it, and decided she was not comfortable proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, after listening to about 100 episodes of the FBS podcast, Cardinal decided to freebirth. In one journal entry, she wrote: “I know it in my bones that freebirthing is my safest and most liberated option.” She purchased FBS’s popular video course, “The Complete Guide to Freebirth”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cardinal’s son Floyd was stillborn in March 2024. During labour Cardinal saw meconium in her waters, a possible sign of distress, but dismissed it because “I was told by FBS that meconium is totally normal”. She stayed home for three days, because “I remember hearing Emilee Saldaya’s voice in my head [from the podcasts], saying: ‘I wouldn’t be concerned for the first three days.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After Floyd died, Cardinal was hospitalised with sepsis and placed in an induced coma. She has had a number of surgeries to repair the damage from his birth, and had to wear an ostomy bag for a time. “I didn’t think that could even be a reality that could happen after birth,” she says. “I almost had to have a hysterectomy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d2f96779-40b9-47cc-9067-22cca6fa54f1" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Emma Cardinal in hospital after her first ostomy surgery, nine months after the stillbirth of Floyd.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Annika Faith&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Looking back, Cardinal believes that much of the information she received from FBS was “incomplete, biased, one-sided and kind of dogmatic”. This includes the information she received on ultrasounds, &lt;a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/uog.6328" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;which are not harmful&lt;/a&gt; to unborn babies when used appropriately. She adds: “You can’t just post about the good side of free birth. What happens when it goes very wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Norris-Clark has not responded to repeated requests for comment about the Guardian’s investigation, which is told through &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-birth-keepers-the-guardian-investigates/id1731314182" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Birth Keepers podcast series&lt;/a&gt;. She has previously defended her partnership with Saldaya, saying FBS is “the most ethical kind of business you can run”. Critics of FBS, she has said, fail to understand the commitment to women taking “radical responsibility” for their births. And she has said it is unfair to hold her responsible for the choices of a mother who consumes her content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/the-birth-keepers" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the spotlight on tragedies involving mothers&lt;/a&gt; around the world who consumed FBS content is posing a crisis for the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Saldaya has also not provided a substantive response to requests for comment, but told the Guardian in one email that “some of these allegations are false or defamatory”. She has previously responded to criticism by saying she does not care if women freebirth, but wants them to have the choice. In recent comments to her followers, she described the Guardian’s reporting as “propaganda” based on “lies”, and suggested her work, words and character had been misrepresented by “twisted, dark attacks”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c3da89e0-6a5e-4f61-ac30-c33a9714c6d0" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Emilee Saldaya pictured in a screengrab of the Free Birth Society website.&lt;/span&gt; Composite: FBS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cardinal is not the only Canadian woman to lose their child after an FBS-influenced free birth. Although &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; has universal healthcare, it is a sparsely populated country, with large “midwifery deserts”. Alternative communities can be sceptical of licensed professionals. As in other parts of the world, FBS messaging often resonates with women who have had traumatic experiences of maternity services or unnecessary medical interventions&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; The Covid pandemic also eroded many women’s trust in the medical establishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Not all of the women who want to avoid licensed providers are ready to freebirth. Some turn to unlicensed attendants, believing they offer their best chance to avoid hospital for their birth. Canada has a community of unlicensed birth attendants, in part due to the historic status of midwifery in the nation. Unlike other countries with strong cultures of midwifery, such as the Netherlands and Denmark, Canada has lagged behind other developed nations when it comes to recognising midwifery. Midwives and their clients can sometimes encounter scepticism, or even hostility, from healthcare professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is in this context that women turn to unlicensed attendants, some of whom, while unregulated, are skilled and experienced underground midwives. But others – such as those who enrolled only in a brief online FBS course – have limited or no experience of births, and no adequate skills for managing potential emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-actually-dont-believe-gravity-is-true" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;‘I actually don’t believe gravity is true’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The most popular of FBS’s schools, the Radical Birthkeeper School, has trained 850 “authentic midwives” from more than 30 countries. On its three-month Zoom course, only about half the content deals with birth, and the rest focuses on self-development and business skills. There are at least 22 FBS-accredited birth keepers in Canada, according to an online directory seen by the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;FBS advises its radical birth keepers – or RBKs – to get out in the world and begin attending births. “The very best way to learn how to do midwifery is by doing midwifery,” Saldaya told her RBK students in 2025. Many have since set up their own businesses supporting women during their free births.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Alexandra Smith, 29, a life coach who hired an FBS-trained RBK for her birth, is from Vancouver Island. “It’s a different way of thinking out here. People prefer to be off grid,” Smith explains. “It’s a holistic space, with lots of hippies, everyone is about free birth and Waldorf education.” Norris-Clark, she adds, is “very popular where I live”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She says women in her area see Norris-Clark as the “founding mother” of free birth, who has “brought a solution to systemic problems” in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;During her pregnancy, Smith says, she listened to the FBS podcast regularly, sometimes multiple episodes a day, and that she found Norris-Clark particularly captivating. Were it not for FBS, she says, she would have had a home birth with a midwife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="3a1ef88e-4d12-464b-a311-803df2969232" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Alexandra Smith with a painting of her son Aksel.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Odessa Rae&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many of the women who follow Norris-Clark on social media, seeking advice in their pregnancies, are unaware of her more extreme views, which she sometimes revealed to FBS students. “I actually don’t believe that gravity is true,” she told FBS students in 2024, adding: “Maybe that just makes me crazy and that’s totally OK.” In another class, she told students they could cut a baby’s umbilical cord with an “old rusty fork”. “I don’t believe in germ theory,” she said, “I don’t believe in contagion,” adding: “But even if contagion were real … there would be a pretty much 0% chance of anything happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Such radical beliefs are not part of FBS’s slick advertising and promotional materials. Smith says she believed, based on FBS marketing, that RBKs were “trained, unregistered midwives”. “I feel like I was falsely advertised to,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;(Others have made similar complaints about FBS. Earlier this year a lawyer for FBS responded to a consumer protection complaint filed in North Carolina alleging a course was mis-sold by stating that the company had always been transparent that it was offering “personal development and sovereign-birth related education” rather than certified midwifery training.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The RBK who Smith hired to attend her during her free birth was in her mid-20s. In a video testimonial she filmed for the RBK school, which had been available online until recently, she said the school “wasn’t your typical school in that it provides hard facts, information, data, and all of that stuff. It was different in that what I gained from the experience was this deep trust in birth, the deep sense of knowing that birth unfolds beautifully if we just step out of the way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When it came to the birth, Smith alleges her RBK was woefully underprepared and “like a deer in headlights”. The RBK, Smith says, missed signs her labour was unfolding abnormally. When Smith’s son Aksel was born on 7 May 2023, his umbilical cord was white, and he was floppy and unresponsive. The RBK, she says, did not attempt to resuscitate the baby, and Smith had to tell her to call 911. Aksel was rushed to hospital, and diagnosed with severe hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy due to oxygen deprivation caused by a placental abruption at his birth. The RBK has not responded to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="legal-cases-and-public-warnings" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Legal cases and public warnings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As unlicensed attendants, including those trained by FBS, proliferate across Canada, the authorities are seeking to clamp down on the practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On Vancouver Island, Canada’s most famous unlicensed birth attendant, Gloria Lemay, 78, is awaiting trial for manslaughter after a girl died 10 days after her birth, which Lemay attended, in January 2024. It is her latest legal battle in a near five-decade long career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 1986, Lemay was &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12289431/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;convicted of criminal negligence&lt;/a&gt; causing death after a baby was born dead at a birth she attended, although she was later acquitted, with the supreme court upholding a lower court’s judgment that a child that is not yet born cannot be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12289431/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;considered a person&lt;/a&gt;. Four years later, after a baby boy died of an infection three days after a birth attended by Lemay, she was fined $1,000 for refusing to answer questions at the inquest. In 2002, Lemay &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.319144" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;was found&lt;/a&gt; in contempt of an order prohibiting her from acting as a midwife. She was arrested in relation to the most recent case in January 2025. A case management conference is scheduled for January 2026. Lemay declined to comment on her upcoming trial, but it is understood she plans to contest the charges and plead not guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="e13efbdf-671e-435e-b41e-97d7084ec8db" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Gloria Lemay trained Yolande Norris-Clark as a doula.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Norris-Clark always credits Lemay with inspiring her lifelong passion for birth. Lemay attended Norris-Clark’s first two births, and trained her as a doula. However those familiar with both women’s careers say Norris-Clark’s views on birth are more extreme than those of her one-time mentor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lemay remains a highly divisive figure. Viewed by some in the medical establishment as a dangerous charlatan, she is equally beloved by many in the birth world, who regard her as a folk hero comparable to the legendary US midwife Ina May Gaskin. The Birth Care Alliance, a campaign to counter what it says is the “systemic overreach into birth sovereignty and midwifery”, is fundraising for her defence. (So too is Norris-Clark, who has described Lemay’s trial as “the attempted martyrdom of a cherished elder”.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lemay’s supporters say she wished to retire years ago, but was repeatedly asked to attend births by women who wanted to give birth outside the system. They say she is highly skilled, supports medical transfer when necessary, and has attended thousands of births in her career, of which only very few ended in tragedy. To her detractors, Lemay is a thorn in the side of the medical establishment, and the authorities have repeatedly targeted her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But Canadian health authorities are also warning about less famous, and considerably less skilled, attendants, some of whom are FBS-affiliated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 2023 the British Columbia College of Nurses and Midwives put out an advisory notice warning the public about the RBK hired by Smith, saying she was not entitled to practise as a midwife, and that she could be offering midwifery services without being permitted to do so. (The Guardian has seen no evidence that she continued to attend births after Smith’s in May 2023.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The following year, a different FBS-linked birth attendant was banned from hospitals across Alberta unless she was seeking medical care for herself or her family. The woman, who marketed herself as a “traditional midwife”, had been a member of the FBS membership community and appeared as a guest on its podcast. A number of complaints were filed against her by concerned staff at two Calgary hospitals after she was linked to two stillbirths in 2021. (Her lawyer told the Guardian that her birth services have been limited to non-medical support.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Smith’s son Aksel spent five weeks in hospital before being discharged in June 2023. Deprived of oxygen during birth, he had severe disabilities and was fed through a tube.

But it’s not just gluttony for gluttony’s sake. There’s a physiological reason December leaves so many of us feeling, well, inflated. “Bloating occurs when the digestive system struggles to efficiently break down and move &lt;a href="/topic/food"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;,” says Wilkinson. “During the Christmas period, this is particularly common as people consume larger portions, eat a wider variety of foods and often stray from their usual routine.” In other words, it’s not you; it’s your gut, desperately trying to keep up with the sudden influx of roast potatoes, cheese boards, cocktails, canapes and late-night leftovers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news? “There are simple, natural ways to support digestion and reduce feelings of heaviness and discomfort in the gut,” Wilkinson explains. Certain foods contain the enzymes, fibres and beneficial &lt;a href="/topic/bacteria"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; that “help the gut work at its best, even when festive indulgences are at their peak”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilkinson has five recommendations for foods that don’t demand restriction or reinvention of saintly behaviour, yet can still stop your Christmas from feeling like one very long, slow-moving meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fermented foods: the microbiome’s festive rescue squad&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfOhoE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/48/iStock-2212401124.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/48/iStock-2212401124.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/48/iStock-2212401124.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A forkful of fermented food is the simplest way to stop the Christmas buffet fighting back" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-188117"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;A forkful of fermented food is the simplest way to stop the Christmas buffet fighting back&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fermented foods are one of the most effective ways to naturally support digestion,” Wilkinson says. “Foods like probiotic-rich yoghurts, sauerkraut, kimchi and kombucha contain ‘healthy bacteria’ designed to help maintain a balanced gut &lt;a href="/topic/microbiome"&gt;microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That microbiome takes a beating in December: more alcohol, more sugar, less &lt;a href="/topic/fibre"&gt;fibre&lt;/a&gt; and less routine. It’s chaos for the trillions of microbes that normally keep our digestion humming along. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When these foods are eaten regularly,” Wilkinson adds, “they introduce this healthy bacteria to the gut, supporting the breakdown of food while reducing gas production and digestive discomfort.” Essentially, they can soften the blow of the Christmas buffet before it lands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermented foods also keep things moving, essential when your mealtimes resemble a tasting menu without an endpoint. “Probiotics also help regulate bowel movements, which is particularly important during a month when eating patterns can become irregular.” A spoonful of sauerkraut or a morning kefir is hardly the height of festive glamour, but neither is feeling like your stomach has turned into a snow globe someone won’t stop shaking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And crucially, they don’t need to be eaten in huge quantities to make a difference. If fermented food simply isn’t your vibe, Wilkinson suggests “making use of gut-friendly supplements” with ingredients like milk thistle, silymarin and dandelion, such as Dr Vegan’s Debloat and Detox range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ginger: the digestive accelerator your stomach will thank you for&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfOhoE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/11/iStock-1406731310.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/11/iStock-1406731310.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/11/iStock-1406731310.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Ginger: the tiny root doing the heavy lifting after your third cheese course" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-188118"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Ginger: the tiny root doing the heavy lifting after your third cheese course&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If fermented foods are the slow-and-steady helpers, &lt;a href="/topic/ginger"&gt;ginger&lt;/a&gt; is the fast-acting first responder. “Ginger has long been used around the world to support digestion and ease digestive discomfort,” Wilkinson says. It works on a mechanical level, not just a folkloric one. “It contains natural compounds that help stimulate the digestive tract and encourage efficient ‘gastric emptying’.” That means food doesn’t linger in the stomach for hours, which is precisely when bloating and fullness set in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When food leaves the stomach more steadily, feelings of bloating and fullness are significantly reduced,” she adds. It’s particularly helpful at Christmas because zingibain – the enzyme in ginger – “helps to break down proteins”. Which, when you consider the sheer volume of meat, cheese, nuts and canapes consumed in December, feels less like a nice-to-have and more like festive survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps that ginger is easy to weave into your routine without feeling like a health kick. “Fresh ginger tea made with hot water, lemon and grated ginger is a soothing option after meals, and ginger can also be added to smoothies, soups or stir-fries for an effortless digestive boost throughout the week.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oats: the quiet hero of a comfortable December&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfOhoE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/35/iStock-2214074450.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/35/iStock-2214074450.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/35/iStock-2214074450.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A bowl of oats – the calm, steadying counterbalance to December’s chaos" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-188119"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;A bowl of oats – the calm, steadying counterbalance to December’s chaos&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re oscillating wildly between sugar highs and gravy-induced slumps, oats might be the grounding force your gut needs. “Oats are one of the most beneficial, affordable foods for maintaining steady, comfortable digestion,” says Wilkinson. While December eating is heavy on refined carbohydrates and low on fibre, oats do the opposite. They provide slow-release energy and the kind of soluble fibre your digestive system is crying out for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They contain beta-glucans, a type of soluble fibre that supports digestive regularity, maintains healthy gut bacteria and helps reduce inflammation in the digestive tract.” That means fewer spikes and crashes, a more cooperative gut and, crucially, less of the bloating that creeps in when your body is overwhelmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Beginning the day with porridge or overnight oats can make a meaningful difference to digestive comfort throughout the festive period,” she says. The stabilised blood sugar also “reduces energy crashes and cravings that can lead to further overeating”. Translation: a bowl of porridge might save you from inhaling half a yule log at 11am because you “haven’t eaten anything yet”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Papaya: the enzyme-packed surprise entry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-awdjp1-0 hYlFdB"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/01/iStock-914617584.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/01/iStock-914617584.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/01/iStock-914617584.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Papaya brings enzyme power to a month built almost entirely on protein and dairy" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-188120"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Papaya brings enzyme power to a month built almost entirely on protein and dairy&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Papaya might not be the first thing you reach for in December, but Wilkinson argues it should be. “Papaya is rich in an enzyme called papain, which helps break down proteins and supports smoother, more comfortable digestion.” This is particularly relevant when your regular meals have been replaced with turkey sandwiches, cheese selections and yet another portion of pigs in blankets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Beyond its enzyme benefits, papaya offers hydration, fibre and antioxidants,” she says. “These elements work together to reduce irritation in the digestive tract and contribute to regular bowel movements.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fresh papaya is best, “though dried papaya can also offer benefits as long as it is consumed in moderation and with minimal added sugars”. It’s worth noting her caveat that “papaya is not recommended for pregnant women”, a crucial detail often missed in wellness content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Apples: the humble digestive workhorse&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bHmhpR"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/25/iStock-2184346751.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/25/iStock-2184346751.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/25/iStock-2184346751.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The humble apple quietly outperforms most festive ‘gut fixes’ – and costs far less" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-188121"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;The humble apple quietly outperforms most festive ‘gut fixes’ – and costs far less&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While papaya brings the drama, &lt;a href="/topic/apples"&gt;apples&lt;/a&gt; bring the reliability. “Apples are one of the simplest yet most effective foods for easing bloating and supporting a healthy gut,” Wilkinson says. They’re rich in pectin, “a form of soluble fibre that absorbs water and helps move food steadily through the digestive tract.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steady movement is key. It prevents the “bunged up” feeling that often defines the later stages of December, when meals begin to stack on top of each other. Apples also contain natural prebiotics, “especially in the core”, which help strengthen the microbiome and improve digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, Wilkinson specifies that “eating apples raw will benefit your digestive system most, though they can also be blended into smoothies and even baked into desserts”. They are, quite simply, the easiest festive gut support going. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A gentler, less bloated Christmas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, no single food is a cure-all. And Wilkinson is clear about the bigger picture: “In addition to the foods listed above, it’s also super important to stay hydrated, get enough sleep, though this isn’t always possible during the festive season.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, with a few fermented foods, a grating of ginger, a bowl of oats, a slice of papaya or an apple tucked into your bag, you can embrace the excess without feeling like your stomach is staging a mutiny. Christmas, after all, is meant to be enjoyed, not endured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 12:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxPa3p3SjhoWHhrejFoUE9VOFNfUXh4UmdSR19zdzVrYTNhamlMRUNLMHJBZWVJcmJTU3lMTlIxT1JOYW1WOGg1R0JRMGk5SWNYekZvS3BSb2l1RE5FS3hIcWh1MXNxNE8zOExSLVRHQjhWLU1Gd2xCQ2dxVEFhOW02RjdzU1hvNDhUWlVOd210UUR4Vm9OQ004N0tIdVhBVFRURTg2U0Jta052Sm11OGN1VTVVSWhaYTd0bEItOF9TQWVSdTdrbG5r</guid></item><item><title>减少一种氨基酸可使小鼠的寿命延长高达33% - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/cutting-back-one-amino-acid-increased-the-lifespan-of-mice-up-to-33</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In mice, limited intakes of one specific essential amino acid can slow the effects of aging and even extend their lifespan, research from the US shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists wonder if these findings could help people improve their longevity and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoleucine"&gt;Isoleucine&lt;/a&gt; is one of three branched-chain amino acids that our bodies use to make proteins.

But rather than gaining weight, they actually burned more energy and maintained leaner body weights, even though their activity levels were no different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Very quickly, we saw the mice on the reduced isoleucine diet lose adiposity – their bodies got leaner, they lost fat," &lt;a href="https://news.wisc.edu/mice-eating-less-of-specific-amino-acid-overrepresented-in-diet-of-obese-people-live-longer-healthier/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Lamming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers think restricting isoleucine in humans, either by diet or pharmaceutical means, has the potential to yield similar anti-aging effects - although, as with all mice studies, we won't know for sure until it's actually tested in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/psilocybin-extends-life-of-human-cells-by-50-in-wild-new-study"&gt;Psilocybin Extends Life of Human Cells by 50% in Wild New Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is easier said than done. Although the food provided to the mice was controlled, the researchers noted that diet is an incredibly complex chemical reaction, and there may be other dietary components involved in producing these results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restricting protein intake in general, for instance, has detrimental effects on the body, mouse or human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translating this research for real-world human use is more complicated than just reducing intake of high-protein foods, even though this is the simplest way to limit isoleucine intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It could be that by choosing healthier foods and healthier eating in general, we might be able to lower isoleucine enough to make a difference," Lamming &lt;a href="https://news.wisc.edu/mice-eating-less-of-specific-amino-acid-overrepresented-in-diet-of-obese-people-live-longer-healthier/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_112585" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-112585" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg.jpg" alt="Graphical abstract shows dietary isoleucine was restricted by 67%, charts showing blood glucose and body weight declining over time / age respectively, reduced frailty and cancer, increased lifespan (survival improved by 33 percent)" class="wp-image-112585 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg.jpg 996w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg-642x642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-112585" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A visual summary of the impact the reduced isoleucine diet had on mice in the study.

Some of the symptoms can look like COVID-19 or RSV or a cold, but it’s important to know what you have. At-home tests are available at pharmacies, or you can go to the doctor to get tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are anti-viral treatments available for flu (and COVID-19) for high-risk populations. These anti-viral medications work best if started early on in the course of your illness. “Get tested early so that if you do qualify for treatment, you can get the treatment, you’ll feel better faster, and you’ll make it less likely that you spread it to other people,” Shipley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your symptoms become concerning — difficulty breathing, chest pains, an ongoing fever — don’t hesitate to get medical attention. “Flu, in particular, we know can cause complications.

Can you be in a space that’s less crowded?” Marnik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also not too late to get your flu shot, which can protect you from severe consequences. “The current data shows that if you define vaccine effectiveness as preventing hospitalization in adults, the current vaccine is about 30 to 50% effective in preventing hospitalization, and in kids, it’s about 70 to 75% effective,” Shipley said. “So, that’s pretty good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hand washing is also an important way to prevent getting sick. It’s also a good idea to disinfect high-touch surfaces (doorknobs, cell phones, remote controls, etc.) with an alcohol-based sanitizer. Getting enough sleep and sticking to your exercise regimen can also help you fight off illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But because it’s an airborne pathogen, we really are thinking about what we’re breathing as being the primary way we could potentially get infected,” Marnik noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“Last year was one of the worst flu seasons on record for pediatric deaths, and there's some concern that this season could be as equally bad, if not worse than last year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- Elisabeth Marnik&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This flu season is expected to be a bad one because of a mutation in the flu virus, which makes it more transmissible. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s doubly important to do all that you can to protect yourself and your loved ones from the flu this year, as it’s expected to be a pretty bad flu season (similar to last year).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Last year was one of the worst flu seasons on record for pediatric deaths, and there’s some concern that this season could be as equally bad, if not worse than last year,” Marnik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of this is because of a new mutation in the flu virus, which is behind the increased cases in other countries like Japan and the United Kingdom, and also here in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mutated strain is known as H3N2 and “it’s changed a lot from prior versions of the flu,” said Marnik. “And when that happens, that means that our immune system doesn’t recognize it as well, so then more people are likely to get sick because they can’t fight it off as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you know someone with the flu right now, they likely have this mutation. “It’s really this H3N2 strain that’s about 85-86% of our cases that we’re seeing now,” Shipley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the mutation, Varga said it “won’t surprise me at all when folks do the final debrief of the flu season to find that vaccine hesitancy was a big contribution to this — a little bit earlier, a little bit more severe, a little bit faster rise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, it’s not too late to get your flu shot and it can protect you from hospitalization and even death.

    &lt;p&gt;Six days after a senior FDA official sent a &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26381196-prasad-email/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;sweeping internal email&lt;/a&gt; claiming that COVID vaccines had caused the deaths of "at least 10 children," &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/12-ex-fda-leaders-criticize-claims-made-by-agency-current-vaccine-chief-vinay-prasad/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;12 former FDA commissioners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; released an &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2517497" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;extraordinary warning&lt;/a&gt; in the Dec. 3 New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wrote that the claims and policy changes in &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/food-drug-administration-covid-19-vaccines-pediatric-deaths/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;the memo from Dr. Vinay Prasad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, pose "a threat to evidence-based vaccine policy and public health security" and break sharply from long-standing scientific norms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is unfolding inside the Food and Drug Administration is not a narrow dispute over COVID vaccines. It is an attempt, according to critics and vaccine scientists, to rewrite the rules governing the entire U.S. vaccine system — how risks are weighed, how benefits are proved, and how quickly lifesaving shots reach the public. Former agency leaders warn that if these changes take hold, the consequences could be lasting: fewer vaccines, slower updates, weakened public trust, and more preventable outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad made clear he sees the moment as corrective. "Never again will the US FDA commissioner have to himself find deaths in children for staff to identify it," he wrote, telling employees the agency's mission, and its "worldview," would change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad's email reopened old arguments about COVID vaccines, using what is generally considered weak and misleading science in the peer-reviewed research community. He claimed that &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-tracy-beth-hoeg-controversy/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;FDA staff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had found "at least 10" deaths in children that happened "after and because of" COVID vaccination, using reports from the &lt;a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    &lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VAERS system is notoriously crowdsourced, meaning anyone can contribute, and scientists say it serves only as a clearinghouse for reports. For example, a person could file a report saying that after getting a flu shot, their hair turned purple. Though that report would remain in the database until it was reviewed, it cannot prove the cause of medical events. But Prasad argued that the true number of deaths was likely higher because many cases go unreported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Substack, &lt;a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/scoop-fda-vaccine-chiefs-memo-cited" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside Medicine&lt;/em&gt; reported Dec. 11&lt;/a&gt; that Prasad used incomplete information and that a Dec. 5 internal FDA memo set the pediatric death toll from COVID shots somewhere between zero and seven. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Emily Hilliard wrote, "The FDA's investigation into deaths caused by Covid vaccines is still ongoing and there's no final count yet of those deaths."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad also accused the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of downplaying the risk of heart inflammation, called myocarditis, in young men; criticized the agency for approving shots for teenagers; and suggested that school and workplace vaccine mandates may have "harmed more children than we saved," adding that "we do not know if we saved lives on balance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;more than 2,100 American children&lt;/a&gt; died of COVID itself since the pandemic began, the CDC reported.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on his erroneous and misleading claims about COVID vaccines, Prasad proposed a major overhaul of how vaccines are approved. He said the FDA should stop relying on immune markers to establish the efficacy of shots, such as antibody levels, and instead require large placebo-controlled randomized trials that track hospitalizations and deaths before approving most new vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many immunologists and vaccine experts say it's unethical to test vaccines known to be effective against disease with a control group that would receive a placebo, exposing them to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a rock-solid principle in bioethics that it is unethical to test any drug or vaccine against a placebo if it is known to be safe and effective. The reason is that such placebo-controlled trials would effectively deny patients access to a vaccine that could prevent a dangerous infectious disease," said Dr. Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad called the current flu vaccine system an "evidence-based catastrophe," questioned the approval of vaccines for pregnant women based on immune response alone, and raised concerns about giving multiple vaccines at once. He told staff to rewrite FDA guidelines to match his new "worldview" and said anyone who disagreed with his "core principles" should resign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former FDA leaders expressed alarm in the NEJM article. They said Prasad is exploiting public frustration over the federal response to COVID to spark doubt about the entire childhood vaccine system, which could undo decades of success in protecting children from deadly diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is really different. And it's really dangerous. And people will be hurt, particularly by the vaccine decisions," former FDA commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in an interview. He also warned that Prasad's proposed policies — which he noted echo positions on vaccines held by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist — could shake the entire vaccine market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The goal of RFK seems to be to make it impossible for vaccines to be available in the U.S.," he said. If the proposals advance, he added,"it won't be a viable business."&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hilliard pushed back sharply on those concerns, writing: "The American people deserve evidence-based science. Dr. Prasad's email lays out a philosophical framework that points us toward that higher standard. We will soon release documents laying out that framework and data confirming how the COVID vaccine resulted in children's deaths that previous leadership failed to properly investigate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For generations, the childhood vaccine program has depended on clear rules, strong safety systems, and public trust. Experts say Prasad's ideas, based on claims they argue are not supported by real evidence, could make it much harder to test, approve, and deliver vaccines to families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fueling parental doubt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad's memo indicates he considers VAERS reports as proof that vaccines caused children's deaths. The system, though, is designed to be only an "&lt;a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/about.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;early warning system&lt;/a&gt;" for potential safety issues with vaccines that can be investigated further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"VAERS signals should never be taken as proof of true vaccine risks without careful, confirmatory studies," said Dr. Katherine Yih, an epidemiologist and longtime investigator with the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a CDC program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing so, scientists say, directly feeds public fear at a time when many parents are already unsure whom to trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Causation requires converging evidence, not just one report or coincidence," said Dr. Robert Hopkins, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad's framework, however, treats uncertainty as a reason to halt development entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts fear this doubt won't stay limited to COVID vaccines. Once parents start to question the FDA's honesty, they may begin doubting long-standing vaccines for measles, polio, or whooping cough — shots that have protected children for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Science must be transparent," Gostin said. If families believe the FDA is misusing data or silencing experts, confidence in the entire vaccine system can collapse, he said. "There's a public narrative that people have lost trust in science, but that's not true. The vast majority want the FDA to make decisions based on the best scientific evidence. Once they believe that the agency is marginalizing scientists and cherry-picking evidence, their trust will plummet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Delicate vaccine pipeline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad's new framework will likely make it far harder for companies to produce or update vaccines. The 12 former FDA commissioners warned that requiring clinical trials for all new or updated shots would slow vaccine improvements and leave people unprotected. His plan, they wrote, "would impede the ability to update vaccines in a timely fashion, especially for respiratory viruses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fast-changing viruses like flu and COVID, this could be disastrous. There's simply not enough time to run full clinical trials every time a virus mutates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also major business effects. Vaccine development is costly, and companies may decide the U.S. is no longer worth the risk. If companies slow down or leave the market, families could face shortages, fewer innovations, and fewer protections for their kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rising fear, falling standards, and under strain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science depends on open and public debate. Prasad's memo warned his employees against it. In addition to demanding that FDA staff members who disagree with him resign, he said their disputes should stay private and called leaks "unethical" and "illegal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susan Ellenberg, a former director of the FDA's Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, warned that Prasad risks destroying the process that makes science credible. "If disagreement is treated as disloyalty, you lose the only mechanism that keeps science honest," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc6" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",6]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without strong internal debate, safety reviews become weaker. "You lose the checks and balances that make vaccine safety science credible," said Dr. Kathryn Edwards, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who served on the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Network during the COVID pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Given its large R&amp;amp;D budget, it was natural to use Pfizer as a barometer of the pharmaceutical industry, which was in the midst of a productivity slump. In the 1990s, the Food and Drug Administration approved a total of 311 new medicines. However, despite far greater investments in R&amp;amp;D, the industry received only 235 approvals over &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/histories-fda-regulated-products/summary-nda-approvals-receipts-1938-present" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the next decade.&lt;/a&gt; At the time, industry skeptics felt this was the new norm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, I had a different view. In the 2000s, the industry was undergoing a major transformation. Based on the remarkable advances being made in the understanding of the causes of diseases thanks to the unraveling of the human genome, along with the appreciation of the potential of drugs outside of small molecules like antibodies and therapeutic vaccines, it was apparent that the pharmaceutical industry was on the cusp of a productivity surge. We were on the verge of a new age in drug discovery that would make big advances in treating cancer, diabetes, and other debilitating conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I suspect that Berenson felt I was a bit naïve in my views. He (or his editors) titled his article “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/18/business/a-pfizer-scientist-sees-research-dividends-ahead.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Optimistic&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/18/business/a-pfizer-scientist-sees-research-dividends-ahead.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; A Pfizer Scientist Sees Research Dividends Ahead&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem have discovered a tiny RNA molecule that can potentially lead the way toward treatments against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Called PreS, the molecule enables a bacteria-eating virus known as a bacteriophage — or phage, for short — to take control of a bacterial cell and use it for its own growth, eventually destroying the bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Antibiotic resistance is one of the most serious global health threats of our time,” Dr. Sahar Melamed, head of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem’s Melamed lab, told The Times of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Understanding how phages operate can “aid scientists in furthering research and therapies that might help fight antibiotic-resistant bacteria,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peer-reviewed study, led by PhD student Aviezer Silverman, MSc student Raneem Nashef, and computational biologist Reut Wasserman from the Hebrew University, in collaboration with Prof. Ido Golding’s group from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, appeared on Thursday in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2025.11.019"&gt;Molecular Cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-article-startup newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="startupisrael" data-from="Newly discovered RNA molecule could lead to new treatments in war against ‘superbugs’"&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The global threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of antimicrobial resistance has become a global health challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the world, these bacteria that defy antibiotics — commonly known as “superbugs” — were directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As early as 2013, a State Comptroller’s report found that some 5,000 Israelis were dying annually from infections associated with this bacterial resistance, and those numbers continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A French-Canadian microbiologist, Félix d’Hérelle, first discovered bacteriophages in 1917. He chose the name from the Ancient Greek phagein, to devour, or to eat bacteria. He found the bacteriophage that destroyed the bacteria that cause dysentery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once penicillin was discovered, most scientists stopped researching phages. As bacteria have become more resistant to antibiotics, researchers realized they needed more solutions and returned to phage research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Phage therapy research in Israel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for a solution has become increasingly urgent as more bacteria become resistant to antibiotic treatment. Over the course of the two-year war in Gaza, dozens of IDF soldiers became infected with these superbugs. One soldier, &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/staff-sgt-res-hanan-drori-26-dies-of-fungal-infection-after-gaza-injury/"&gt;Hanan Drori&lt;/a&gt;, died from a severe fungal infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the Israel Phage Therapy Center was established in partnership with Hadassah Medical Center, focusing on the therapeutic potential of phages that target and kill bacteria with precision, with numerous successful phage treatments against microbial infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the war began, the center’s researchers have named some of the phages that they discover in &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/researcher-names-potent-lifesaving-virus-after-soldier-boyfriend-killed-in-gaza-war/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; of people who were killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Listening to RNAs ‘talk’ to each other&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melamed said the lab used RIL-seq (RNA Interaction by Ligation and sequencing), a method he developed during his post-doctorate studies in Prof. Hanah Margalit’s lab at Hebrew University.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3715225" class="wp-caption  alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/Sahar-Melamed-Credit-Bruno-Charbit-e1766070544887.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-vertical wp-image-3715225" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/Sahar-Melamed-Credit-Bruno-Charbit-e1766070544887-300x480.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientist said that he invented a new application for RIL-seq in this current study to map interactions “while the bacteria are infected with the phage,” Melamed explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIL-seq is a method that identifies interacting RNA molecules inside a cell by “gluing” them together and then sequencing the joined molecules to see which RNAs are paired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers could study how small RNAs “talked” to each other within the bacteria, uncovering “a new level of communication between bacteria and phages,” he said, mapping RNA interactions that were previously hard to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melamed said they were surprised to discover the tiny RNA molecule PreS inside a lambda phage, which attacks E. coli bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[Lambda] is one of the most studied viruses for the past 75 years,” he said, “but we found PreS, which no one had noticed before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PreS hijacks the bacterium’s replication machinery,” Melamed said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is then able to “reproduce efficiently inside individual bacteria,” he explained. “It also maximizes its spread through the bacterial population.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an increasing number of phages are produced, they get so numerous that they burst out of the cell, killing the bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3715235" class="wp-caption  alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/image005-e1766064633176.png"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3715235" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/image005-e1766064633176-640x400.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

(Courtesy/Aviezer Silverman)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncovering how PreS takes control of bacterial cells provides important basic knowledge that could help scientists design smarter, more effective phage treatments in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melamed said his lab’s next study will focus on finding other RNA molecules in diverse phages, “to understand how they also manipulate bacterial systems and tailor them for their needs.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3715239" class="wp-caption  alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/image006.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-3715239" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/image006-640x400.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Scientists are actively seeking alternative treatments for antimicrobial resistance,” Melamed said. “One particularly promising approach is phage therapy, which uses viruses that specifically infect and kill bacteria, offering a targeted and potentially powerful alternative to conventional antibiotics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that this research changes “how we think about the molecular dialogue between phages and their hosts, providing potential new routes for phage therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;

Past research shows that between &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6780739/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;40-55% of women&lt;/a&gt; advancing through menopause experience low sexual desire, and about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378512209001480" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;9% of postmenopausal women&lt;/a&gt; have HSDD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the expanded approval to postmenopausal women under 65, &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; spoke with three women’s health experts to find out more about how Addyi works, its side effects, what does this approval mean for menopausal women, and any non-medication alternatives they suggest for low libido. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addyi is a prescription medication manufactured by Sprout Pharmaceuticals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Addyi is a non hormonal medication that works on &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326649" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;neurotransmitters&lt;/a&gt; in the brain to help regulate mood and increase sex drive,” &lt;a href="http://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/susan-marie-pacana/1315205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Susan Marie Pacana, MD&lt;/a&gt;, minimally invasive gynecologic surgeon and OB/GYN at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center in New Jersey, told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Addyi is a medication for women that, according to the manufacturer, increases sexual desire,” &lt;a href="https://www.drprudencehall.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Prudence Hall, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an OB/GYN in private practice in Santa Monica, CA, and author of &lt;em&gt;Radiant Again &amp;amp; Forever: Overcome Menopause &amp;amp; Restore Your Radiance&lt;/em&gt;, added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Addyi boosts sex drive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After taking it for a month, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;dopamine and serotonin&lt;/a&gt; levels are apparently enhanced, which supposedly increases sexual desire.”&lt;br&gt;— Prudence Hall, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the expanded approval for postmenopausal women under the age of 65, &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/g-thomas-ruiz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;G. Thomas Ruiz, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board certified OB/GYN at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that Addyi could now help a greater number of women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The group of women where I get the biggest complaints of decreased libido is in the 50 to 60 year old age bracket, so potentially this could be a very important medication for them,” Ruiz added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pacana, who is also a Menopause Society Certified Practitioner, commented that the lack of medications for low libido has been a long-standing issue, but the new FDA approval for this treatment up to age 65 is a major step forward. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Women of all ages present to our office with complaints of low sex drive that affect their relationships, self-esteem, and body image,” she explained. “It often is accompanied by feelings of shame, frustration and guilt when women are unable to meet their partner’s sexual expectations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug to be covered by insurance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previously, I could prescribe it off-label for postmenopausal women, but they were unfairly denied insurance coverage. Now, with this official approval, we can finally expect insurers to cover this necessary treatment for a wider population of women.” &lt;br&gt;— Susan Marie Pacana, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all medications, Addyi has known potential side effects, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Constipation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dizziness &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dry mouth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sleepiness or insomnia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stomach or back pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiredness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruiz said it would be very helpful for the drug company to issue a simple handout of all the “do’s and don’ts” associated with Addyi. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’ve got to make it as least confusing for patients to use as possible, so a simple do’s and don’ts information sheet would be useful,” he detailed. “And that would be useful for providers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women who may not want to take medication, what other things can they do to help with a low libido? For perimenopausal and menopausal women, Hall said optimizing their declining and absent &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/what-are-hormones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;hormones&lt;/a&gt; is extremely effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over the 40 years of my work in this area, I commonly see women’s sexuality bloom into a renaissance of youthful passion,” she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One alternative: estradiol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323178" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Estradiol&lt;/a&gt; is extremely effective for this, with the estradiol patch and compounded cream being my top two choices. When &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/276013" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;testosterone&lt;/a&gt; is low and replaced to youthful levels, orgasms become more easily accessed and are stronger. It is not uncommon for women to tell me that their desire is completely gone and that they can’t even have an orgasm.” &lt;br&gt;— Prudence Hall, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also when &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/thyroid-gland-function" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;thyroid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/stress-hormones" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;adrenal stress hormones&lt;/a&gt; are precisely optimized, energy is increased and depression recedes. Women report that their sexuality returns to youthful levels causing a resurgence of intimacy and contentment with themselves and their relationships,” Hall continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘Scheduling’ sex may help&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruiz said that sometimes a low libido comes down to a lack of a female patient’s understanding of how their body functions sexually, and how to communicate it to her partner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spontaneous vs. responsive desire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In terms of the first stage of sexual activity, for men arousal is instantaneous. For women, [i]t’s a little bit more diffused and not as direct, so that arousal time may take 20 to 30 minutes.” &lt;br&gt;— G. Thomas Ruiz, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Scheduling time for intimacy where that is the primary goal, things like that are helpful. Common activities where they’re together with their partner. Foreplay may take all day — it’s not a crazy thing to think about. And of course a good relationship with your partner — if you don’t have a good relationship with your partner, there’s not going to be a sex drive,” Ruiz explained. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I also will also encourage women to practice with self stimulation so that they understand how their body works and they communicate that to their partner,” he added. “And that actually works for menopausal women as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 06:11:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPeHo0N0RTdVRjZElvaTdvX3RCSTNnQlE2MzZqanJRSFZ6WG1FRGR0My0tMWpOaGxXM3ZsWW8zbFVESFdFZ2hZYjBTdUNhMjVIRmZPaVVNY19mb0NHb1RiN2FKeHh0V0trZzJoR0hKbGhQSnlPQmo1QjRqOVZvZ3NYWldqay1qYVdOenUxcHJra1FuU2tmU25wbFNaQkVSdnNWZF82YjgwNzVzY1RIQ0RlUlZ3</guid></item><item><title>14种精神疾病共有5个遗传根源，主要研究揭示- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/14-psychiatric-disorders-share-5-genetic-roots-major-study-reveals</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We know that the genes we're born with contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/couples-are-more-likely-to-share-psychiatric-disorders-but-why"&gt;the risk of psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt; during our lifetimes, and a new study shows there is significantly more biological overlap across these conditions than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international team of scientists behind the research believes that their findings can help improve how these conditions are diagnosed and treated: not just through symptoms and behavior, but also through shared &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-the-first-single-gene-to-directly-cause-mental-illness"&gt;genetic factors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now, we diagnose psychiatric disorders based on what we see in the room, and many people will be diagnosed with multiple disorders. That can be hard to treat and disheartening for patients," &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2025/12/10/sweeping-study-shows-similar-genetic-factors-underlie-multiple-psychiatric-disorders"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Andrew Grotzinger, from the University of Colorado Boulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This work provides the best evidence yet that there may be things that we are currently giving different names to that are actually driven by the same biological processes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/owning-a-cat-could-double-your-risk-of-schizophrenia-research-suggests"&gt;Cat Ownership Linked to Increased Risk of Schizophrenia, Research Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed DNA data from more than 1 million people diagnosed with 14 different psychiatric disorders, comparing their genomes with those of another 5 million people without these diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186166" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186166" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/FiveGroups.jpg" alt="Disorder groups" class="wp-image-186166 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/FiveGroups.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/FiveGroups-600x286.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186166" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Disorders were grouped based on shared genetics.

Together, these five factors, composed of 238 genetic variants, accounted for an average of around two thirds of the genetic differences between participants &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hidden-signals-can-reveal-mental-illness-more-clearly-than-a-brain-scan"&gt;with psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt; and those without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each factor was most strongly linked with a particular group of conditions: compulsive disorders (like obsessive-compulsive disorder), internalizing disorders (such as anxiety and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="186163" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;), substance use disorders, neurodevelopmental conditions (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/children-with-autism-adhd-and-anorexia-share-a-common-microbe-imbalance"&gt;including autism&lt;/a&gt;), and finally bipolar disorder and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="186163" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/bipolar-disorder-linked-to-a-higher-risk-of-early-death-than-smoking"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-new-schizophrenia-risk-genes-in-first-of-its-kind-study"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizoaffective_disorder"&gt;which typically aren't diagnosed together&lt;/a&gt; – the researchers found that 70 percent of the genetic signaling common with these two conditions was shared between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Genetically, we saw that they are more similar than they are unique," &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2025/12/10/sweeping-study-shows-similar-genetic-factors-underlie-multiple-psychiatric-disorders"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Grotzinger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By identifying what is shared across these disorders, we can hopefully come up with ways to target them in a different way that doesn't require four separate pills or four separate psychotherapy interventions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has already shown substantial overlap between psychiatric disorders: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.17121383"&gt;More than half&lt;/a&gt; of those diagnosed with one condition are eventually diagnosed with at least one additional disorder.

Some of these pathways are involved in early brain development and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-cells-may-actually-try-to-predict-the-future-during-sleep"&gt;neuron signaling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic factors common to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are associated with excitatory neurons, whereas the variants shared in the depression/anxiety gene cluster appear to involve &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-alzheimers-finding-brains-support-cells-may-be-fueling-disease"&gt;oligodendrocytes, cells that support neurons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been studying &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/several-psychiatric-disorders-share-the-same-root-cause-study-reveals"&gt;the genetic underpinnings&lt;/a&gt; of psychiatric disorders &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cortex-transcriptome-overlap-different-mental-illnesses"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt; now, with the ultimate aim of improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment effectiveness, particularly for those with multiple conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the findings won't immediately change clinical diagnostic practices, the researchers hope their data will inform future guidelines.

            The US Department of Health and Human Services is planning to overhaul the schedule of recommended vaccines for children in the US, a person familiar with the plans told CNN on Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000d3b6spljo55m7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The proposed new schedule would recommend fewer shots, bringing it closer in line with what’s recommended in other developed countries. The expectation is that the US schedule will be close to, if not identical to, recommendations in Denmark, according to the person, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak about the matter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000e3b6sty2n2m2z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The plan has not been finalized and could still change. HHS had planned to make the announcement Friday afternoon, the person said, but it was pushed to 2026 so as not to conflict with White House plans to announce further efforts to lower drug costs through “Most Favored Nation” pricing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000f3b6swavnmumf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An HHS spokesperson declined to comment and referred questions to the agency’s earlier statement that it had postponed a “children’s health announcement” until next year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000g3b6sgaxzdkrm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The planned overhaul comes weeks after President Donald Trump ordered officials to review the childhood vaccine schedule and weigh recommending fewer shots.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000h3b6se2x10v3f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is ridiculous!” Trump wrote earlier this month in a Truth Social post about the current US schedule. “That is why I have just signed a Presidential memorandum directing the Department of Health and Human Services to ‘FAST TRACK’ a comprehensive evaluation of Vaccine Schedules from other Countries around the World, and better align the U.S. Vaccine Schedule.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In a post on X, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. responded: “Thank you, Mr. President. We’re on it.”

            Denmark’s &lt;a href="https://vaccine-schedule.ecdc.europa.eu/Scheduler/ByCountry?SelectedCountryId=58&amp;amp;IncludeChildAgeGroup=true&amp;amp;IncludeChildAgeGroup=false&amp;amp;IncludeAdultAgeGroup=true&amp;amp;IncludeAdultAgeGroup=false" target="_blank"&gt;2025 vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt;, published by the European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, shows that the country vaccinates children against fewer infectious diseases than the US does.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Denmark doesn’t currently recommend immunization against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, for children; the US does. RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000l3b6s3r5exkbz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It also doesn’t recommend the rotavirus, hepatitis A, meningococcal, flu or chickenpox vaccines for children, while these vaccines are on &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html#table-1" target="_blank"&gt;the US schedule&lt;/a&gt;.

            “Why would we ever want to emulate that?” asked Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “They made a financial decision. They decided to allow that degree of suffering and hospitalization. They didn’t want to spend that much money per hospitalization prevented.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Dr. Peter Hotez, a pediatrician who directs the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, called the plan “a bit of a head scratcher.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The administration’s focus on “Denmark’s system of socialism and universal healthcare … is interesting but out of character” with its rhetoric, he said in a text message.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc8a3kc00063b6sreze6lyi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “More likely, it’s part of DHHS’s consistent efforts to make vaccines unavailable to the American people. They cherry-picked Denmark because they administer the fewest vaccines of any Western country. And by going to Denmark’s system it affords them an opportunity to deprive Americans of vaccines for bacterial meningitis and rotavirus which are major causes of morbidity and mortality of America’s children. They’ve not done their epidemiological homework to realize how these are major illnesses in the U.S.,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc8a9oh00083b6sfazll7tu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s superficial, ideological, and incurious. The DHHS in this administration couldn’t care less if children suffer from disease as long as at it meets their ideological targets.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg, newly named acting director of the US Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, gave a presentation on the Danish vaccine schedule at &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/05/health/cdc-advisers-hepatitis-b-vaccine"&gt;this month’s meeting&lt;/a&gt; of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000n3b6s5spqpl7u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think one of the reasons Denmark may do a better job at making their vaccine recommendations is, it’s not a politicized discussion,” said Hoeg, a dual citizen of the US and Denmark. She described a multiparty system, culture of debate and strong acknowledgment of knowns and unknowns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000o3b6s9igxwdnk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hoeg noted that with fewer vaccines, there’s less exposure to aluminum, which is used as an adjuvant — an ingredient added to create a stronger immune response. It’s used in several childhood vaccines because it enables doctors to give fewer doses, which requires a smaller amount of vaccine. Despite broad evidence that using aluminum-containing adjuvants in vaccines is safe, Kennedy has argued that aluminum in vaccines is linked to allergies and other health conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            During the CDC meeting, Dr. Adam Langer, the agency’s expert on hepatitis B, took issue with the Denmark comparison ahead of a significant change to hepatitis B vaccine recommendations for infants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000q3b6scvj2zk8f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The United States is a unique country,” he began. Of Denmark, he pointed out, “the entire country has 6 million people. The population of New York City alone is 8 million people.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Other differences cited by Langer:

        &lt;span class="list__text vossi-list_elevate__text "&gt;
            More than 95% of pregnant women in Denmark are screened for hepatitis B, “far higher than the number in the United States.”
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.1.text" class="list__item vossi-list_elevate__item inline-placeholder"&gt;

        &lt;span class="list__text vossi-list_elevate__text "&gt;
            Denmark has a national health registry that compiles health information at the individual level; “the US does not have that, and I imagine that our privacy culture would not permit us to ever have something like that.”
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;span class="list__text vossi-list_elevate__text "&gt;
            In Denmark, pregnant women who test positive for hepatitis B virus are followed up with, along with all infants, to ensure they’re vaccinated and tested for the virus, whereas in the US, “many of these infants are lost to follow-up as soon as they leave the hospital.”
        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            “Denmark and, for that matter, virtually all other high-income countries are not really peer nations,” Langer concluded.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000x3b6s6at764v1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hoeg responded that the level of risk for babies isn’t different because of differences in health care  systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjc7ddvc000y3b6s03r76yad@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As a mother of children who were born in Denmark, moving to the United States, they were low-risk there, they were low-risk here. I couldn’t understand why you would use a vaccine in one country but not the other for the same level of risk,” she said. “I think the frustration maybe that American parents face is, if they know that their child is at low risk, why we as a country choose to try to vaccinate our way out of an imperfect health care system.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjcc6wlq00003b6s9bg54ema@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;: A previous version of this story incorrectly said a vaccine listed on the Danish childhood schedule was not included on the schedule.&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

But when the pain worsened and radiated down her leg and into her ankle, she sought medical help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her doctor suspected she had tendinitis - inflammation of the tendons, the thick cords that attach muscle to bones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While tendinitis, which affects hundreds of thousands of Americans every year, can come on suddenly after injury, most develop it from repetitive motions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors blamed the suspected condition on the 23-year-old being 5ft 9in tall and sitting in a salon chair all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The doctors had mentioned that it could be because of my job...' Bailey said&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. 'Some days were worse than others, and I tried to figure out what was triggering it, but at the time I didn't know what it was.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors referred her to physical therapy, but the pain worsened and left her unable to do the exercises. It took multiple doctor appointments over seven more months before a physician ordered an MRI scan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, in October 2025, the MRI revealed Bailey had two tumors: one in her femur and one in her groin. Soon after, she was diagnosed with stage four Ewing sarcoma, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14583791/teenager-killed-ewing-sarcoma-bone-cancer-sign.html"&gt;a rare cancer that grows in bone cells&lt;/a&gt; and the soft tissues surrounding the bones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brooke Bailey (pictured), a 23-year-old nail technician from Pennsylvania, suffered hip pain for months, which doctors insisted was due to her height and sitting at her job &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey is pictured above during cancer treatments. Doctors will determine in January whether she needs surgery alongside her current chemotherapy plan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I never thought in my mind that it was cancer, so it was scary, but I kind of felt relieved, too, because I was like, "I'm not crazy. There is something wrong and I knew it the whole time,"' Bailey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was like, "What's next? I'm ready to start the healing process because I want my life back."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ewing sarcoma affects just 200 to 250 Americans every year, the vast majority of whom are children and young adults. It's unclear exactly how many annual deaths there are because the cancer is so rare, but experts estimate there are several dozen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The overall five-year survival rate is 81 percent, according to the American Cancer Society. If it spreads to other organs, that rate drops to 41 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stage four cancer means the disease has spread from its primary site - Bailey's cancer likely spread from her femur to her groin area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include bone pain, fractures, swelling or tenderness near the affected areas. Some patients may also feel a lump in their arm, leg, chest or pelvis, according to the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bailey is now undergoing six rounds of chemotherapy and will be assessed in January to determine if she needs surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her mother, Marissa Koons, has set up a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-brookes-fight-against-ewing-sarcoma"&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt; to help raise money for egg retrieval, as chemotherapy can destroy eggs and lead to infertility. The fundraiser also covers travel and accommodations for the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The circled sections in the above scan show tumors in Bailey's femur and groin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey's mother (pictured left with Bailey) set up a GoFundMe to help with her daughter's egg retrieval. They wanted to do the procedure so she can possibly have children in the future&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey (pictured) is undergoing treatment and is encouraging other young people to seek a second opinion if they feel something is wrong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We used that money for the egg retrieval because the insurance didn't cover that at all,' Koons said. '[The fundraiser] exceeded the goal, and we're at over $7,000 now, which has helped us to pay for the egg retrieval without me going into my credit card debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had to stay at a hotel for this round of chemo, the travel, prescriptions. It really did help, but most of it went to the egg retrieval because that really did need to be taken care of.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the meantime, Bailey is encouraging other young people to look for a second opinion if they are repeatedly dismissed by their doctors.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've learned that you really are your biggest advocate for yourself, and if you don't like what somebody says, go see somebody else,' she said. 'I wish that's what I had done. You are your [own] person, and you need to take care of yourself...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You really need to be kind of forceful when it comes to [advocating for yourself with doctors], which is sad. But if you know that there's something wrong with you, then you know. I knew that there was something wrong with me. I didn't know that it was cancer, but I knew deep down inside that there was something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think the biggest takeaway from this is to listen to your body.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As the world's population ages, the number of people living with dementias such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="186179" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the lack of curative treatments and the limited effectiveness of available medications, interest in new therapeutic approaches is growing. Among them are cannabinoids from the cannabis plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small new Brazilian study published in the international &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13872877251389608"&gt;Journal of Alzheimer's Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; investigated the effects of microdoses of cannabis extract on patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. The results found positive effects, without the associated "high" of cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/compounds-in-cannabis-promote-healthy-aging-new-study-discovers"&gt;Compounds in Cannabis Promote Healthy Aging, New Study Discovers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The logic of microdoses&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Professor Francisney Nascimento and colleagues at the &lt;a href="https://portal.unila.edu.br/"&gt;Federal University of Latin American Integration (UNILA)&lt;/a&gt;, recruited 24 elderly patients (60-80 years) diagnosed with mild Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It evaluated the effects of daily use of an oil prepared from cannabis extract containing THC and CBD in similar proportions and extremely low concentrations (0.3 mg of each cannabinoid). These sub-psychoactive doses do not cause the "high" associated with recreational use of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extract used was donated by &lt;a href="https://abraceesperanca.org.br/"&gt;ABRACE&lt;/a&gt;, Brazil's biggest patient association, and had no contribution from cannabis companies or other funding sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microdosing" is a term usually associated with recreational use of psychedelics. Given the size of the dose, it would be easy to question whether it could have any effect at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doses below 1 mg of the cannabinoid compounds are not frequently reported in the literature of clinical practice. However, the researchers' decision to use microdosing did not come out of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the group led by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Zimmer"&gt;Andreas Zimmer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andras-Bilkei-Gorzo"&gt;Andras Bilkei-Gorzo&lt;/a&gt; had already demonstrated that very low doses of THC restored cognition in elderly mice, reversing gene expression patterns and brain synapse density in the hippocampus to levels similar to those of young animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186182" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186182" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/cannabis_extract_alzheimers_header-642x361.jpg" alt="cannabis extract" class="size-medium wp-image-186182" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/cannabis_extract_alzheimers_header-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/cannabis_extract_alzheimers_header-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/cannabis_extract_alzheimers_header-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/cannabis_extract_alzheimers_header.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186182" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Microdosing cannabis extract isn't frequently reported in the literature of clinical practice.

They found cognitive improvement, assessed using the Adas-Cog scale, a set of tasks using things like word recall to test cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This triggered the decision to run a more robust  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="186179" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; in human volunteers to verify the cognitive-enhancement effects observed in the volunteer. The second study was a properly &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41160460/"&gt;controlled, randomised, and double-blinded clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What we found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several clinical scales were used to objectively measure the impact of cannabis treatment. This time, the improvement was observed in the &lt;a href="https://muhc.ca/sites/default/files/micro/m-PT-OT/OT/Mini-Mental-State-Exam-%28MMSE%29.pdf"&gt;mini-mental state exam (MMSE) scale&lt;/a&gt;, a widely used scale for assessing cognitive function in patients with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a validated set of questions that are asked to the patient, with the aid of an accompanying person (typically a family member or helper). After 24 weeks of treatment, the group receiving the cannabis extract showed stabilisation in their scores, while the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="186179" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; group showed cognitive deterioration (worsening of Alzheimer's symptoms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact was modest but relevant; patients using cannabis microdosing scored two to three points higher than their placebo counterparts (full points on the MMSE is 30). In patients with preserved or moderately impaired cognitive function, it may be unrealistic to expect major changes in a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis extracts did not improve other non-cognitive symptoms, like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="186179" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, general health, or overall quality of life. On the other hand, there was no difference in adverse side effects. This was likely due to the extremely low dose used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This result echoes findings from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-022-02208-1"&gt;my 2022 study&lt;/a&gt;, which found a reduction in endocannabinoid signalling during ageing, meaning ageing brains are more prone to cognitive degradation without the protection of the cannabinoids. Among other mechanisms, cannabinoids seem to protect cognition by reducing drivers of inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A new paradigm: cannabis without the 'high'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest obstacle to the acceptance of cannabis as a therapeutic tool in brain ageing is perhaps not scientific, but cultural. In many countries, the fear of "getting high" deters many patients and even healthcare professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But studies such as this show there are ways to get around this problem by using doses so low they do not cause noticeable changes in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/consciousness" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73104" data-postid="186179" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt;, but which can still modulate important biological systems, such as inflammation and neuroplasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_186187" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-186187" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/brain_cells_microdosing_642.jpg" alt="neurons" class="wp-image-186187 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/brain_cells_microdosing_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/brain_cells_microdosing_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-186187" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Low doses of certain drugs may modulate key brain systems without altering consciousness.

This could open the door to new formulations focused on prevention, especially in more vulnerable populations, such as elderly people with mild cognitive impairment or a family history of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What now?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its potential, the study also has important limitations: the sample size is small, and the effects were restricted to one dimension of the cognition scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the work represents an unprecedented step: it is the first clinical trial to successfully test the microdose approach in patients with Alzheimer's disease. It is a new way of looking at this plant in the treatment of important diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-6-key-depression-symptoms-that-predict-dementia-risk"&gt;Scientists Identify 6 Key Depression Symptoms That Predict Dementia Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To move forward, new studies with a larger number of participants, longer follow-up times, and in combination with biological markers (such as neuroimaging and inflammatory biomarkers) will be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only then will it be possible to answer the fundamental question: can cannabis slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease? We have taken an important step towards understanding this, but for now, the question remains unanswered.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271170/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;It probably sucked to be a Roman soldier guarding Hadrian’s Wall circa the third century CE. W.H. Auden imagined the likely harsh conditions in his poem “&lt;a href="https://hellopoetry.com/poem/788/roman-wall-blues/"&gt;Roman Wall Blues&lt;/a&gt;,” in which a soldier laments enduring wet wind and rain with “lice in my tunic and a cold in my nose.” We can now add chronic nausea and bouts of diarrhea to his list of likely woes, thanks to parasitic infections, according to a new paper published in the journal Parasitology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/02/this-ancient-roman-ceramic-pot-was-probably-a-portable-toilet-study-finds/"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt;, archaeologists can learn a great deal by studying the remains of intestinal parasites in ancient feces. For instance, in 2022, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/intestinal-parasites-plagued-jerusalems-wealthy-elite-toilet-excavation-reveals/"&gt;we reported&lt;/a&gt; on an analysis of soil samples collected from a stone toilet found within the ruins of a swanky 7th-century BCE villa just outside Jerusalem. That analysis revealed the presence of parasitic eggs from four different species: whipworm, beef/pork tapeworm, roundworm, and pinworm. (It’s the earliest record of roundworm and pinworm in ancient Israel.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that same year, researchers from the University of Cambridge and the University of British Columbia &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/02/this-ancient-roman-ceramic-pot-was-probably-a-portable-toilet-study-finds/"&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; the residue on an ancient Roman ceramic pot excavated at the site of a 5th-century CE Roman villa at Gerace, a rural district in Sicily. They identified the eggs of intestinal parasitic worms commonly found in feces—strong evidence that the 1,500-year-old pot in question was most likely used as a chamber pot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other prior studies have compared fecal parasites found in hunter-gatherer and farming communities, revealing dramatic dietary changes, as well as shifts in settlement patterns and social organization coinciding with the rise of agriculture. This latest paper analyzes sediment collected from sewer drains at the Roman fort at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vindolanda"&gt;Vindolanda&lt;/a&gt;, located just south of the defense fortification known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall"&gt;Hadrian’s Wall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An antiquarian named William Camden recorded the existence of the ruins in a 1586 treatise. Over the next 200 years, many people visited the site, discovering a military bathhouse in 1702 and an altar in 1715.  Another altar found in 1914 confirmed that the fort had been called Vindolanda. Serious archaeological excavation at the site began in the 1930s. The site is most famous for the so-called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vindolanda_tablets" data-uri="3b2e6e2a335fbdd9d5b162bf089157b0"&gt;Vindolanda tablets,&lt;/a&gt; among the oldest surviving handwritten documents in the UK—and for the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/touch-wood-luck-protection-power-or-pleasure-a-wooden-phallus-from-vindolanda-roman-fort/53F4B0838D23DB65F6A244695624102E"&gt;2023 discovery&lt;/a&gt; of what appeared to be an ancient Roman dildo, although &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/remember-that-ancient-roman-dildo-it-might-just-be-an-old-roman-drop-spindle/"&gt;others argued&lt;/a&gt; the phallus-shaped artifact was more likely to be a drop spindle used for spinning yarn.&lt;/p&gt;

Makhana supports metabolism and immune function through the anti-oxidants, magnesium and high plant-based protein present in them.  Compared to fried winter snacks, lightly roasted or seasoned makhana offers both comfort and balance.&lt;br&gt;Dry fruits aid warmth, energy and immunity. Since winter cravings lead to richer and denser foods, dry fruits are a perfect choice. The nutrient density of these components supports the body during seasonal shifts. Whether combined together, taken with beverages or eaten individually, dry fruits are a nutrient rich approach for winters.&lt;br&gt;As winters set in, incorporating these dry fruits into everyday diet can boost immunity and reinforce sustained health but still keeps snacks flavourful and satisfying to taste buds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>威斯康星州东北部儿童死于流感；该州西部儿科新冠肺炎死亡- WLUK</title><link>https://fox11online.com/news/state/wisconsin-reports-two-pediatric-deaths-this-season-from-covid-19-and-influenza-respiratory-illness-rsv-children-vaccine-health-season-flu-cough-sick</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;(WLUK) -- Wisconsin health officials announced Thursday that two children in the state, including one from Northeast Wisconsin, have died from &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/respiratory/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;respiratory illnesses &lt;/a&gt;so far this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One death was a result of COVID-19 and the other from influenza.

(WLUK)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a news conference, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services did not say how old the children were, but shared the child who died of the flu was from the northeast region of Wisconsin and the child who died of COVID was from the western part of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said they are working to confirm whether the children were vaccinated. Both had some underlying conditions that increased their risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DHS is urging everyone, especially young children, older adults, people with chronic health conditions, and women who are pregnant,&lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/immunization/vaccine-facts.htm" target="_blank"&gt; to get vaccinated &lt;/a&gt;for flu, RSV and COVID-19. Six months is the earliest a child can be vaccinated for these illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We really do want people to consider that these tragedies can happen and the best way to prevent these things is, obviously, to get vaccinated as quickly as possible. With the holidays coming up and the get-togethers with the relatives, friends, we really encourage people to get the vaccine for both COVID and also for influenza," said DHS Respiratory Disease Epidemiologist Tom Haupt. "It's not too late and it's a safe vaccine and it's still in plentiful supply."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="YouTubeEmbed_youTubeEmbed__ygKv1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haupt said the current COVID and flu vaccine rates for Wisconsin children is "very low."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want them to be increased significantly. To be honest with you, it's kind of disappointing, the numbers that have come in," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all ages in Wisconsin, the flu vaccine status sits at only 28% right now and at just 10.6% for COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We really want people to realize how severe influenza is. Not only in the acute stage, but also in follow ups of what can happen after you have the acute stage of influenza," Haupt said. "Influenza can lead to further cardiac problems for both children and adults. It can lead to encephalitis... It's what can happen later on. Protecting yourself and protecting those people around you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wisconsinites can take the following daily actions to help stop the spread of germs and increase protection against respiratory viruses:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wash hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid touching their nose, eyes and mouth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay home and away from others if feeling sick&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid being around others who are sick or have flu symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing and encourage children to do the same&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear a high-quality mask around others to prevent the spread of respiratory illness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WLUK</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 23:12:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAJBVV95cUxNX0o2c1NOT1RPdWpFMWVuaGpCOXU3eHJydC1NY0gwM3VIMmZnZDZ1bzJBaWpBbjU2bjVlRGVETENMOC1qclZlMWZNN1o1eXczdzZkaEZUM2dRb0FnaVJLeWJXYXJEUWJJR1A3VUpfbXVJb2cza0s0QW5JeXl0elFqUUkwWEY5R0xHRnA1UEdtZ2lLNjJuaE95TzdVLUNUclgzaEZ6X2VVUE8zNjNmMzdhVEE2OHAzQk5vY2tsVjEtRTdwd21sbGszTHFrMkV6VlVZWWttS1d0UGx1RzVpLTZsaXVHVjJsREJIdDdwMzJVSzBXTE9UeGFrY2h6aVRMUzdXNzNkbi1iOG9LUDZ0bUVfZg</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心向与FDA高级官员有联系的有争议的丹麦研究人员颁发奖学金- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/18/cdc-grant-controversial-researchers-ties-to-tracy-beth-hoeg/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON — The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has awarded a $1.6 million grant to controversial researchers at the University of Southern Denmark with ties to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/11/tracy-beth-hoeg-fda-cder-director-faces-staff-mistrust/"&gt;top Food and Drug Administration official&lt;/a&gt; Tracy Beth Høeg. The funding is for a study on hepatitis B vaccines that some experts say may be unethical and is unlikely to generate data relevant to use of the vaccine in this country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Christine Stabell Benn and her husband, Peter Aaby, lead the Bandim Health Project, a research site located in Guinea-Bissau in West Africa. The CDC has awarded them a grant to &lt;a href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;run a placebo-controlled trial of the hepatitis B vaccine&lt;/a&gt; in newborns. Guinea-Bissau currently gives babies their first hepatitis B vaccine dose at 6 weeks of age, not birth. It plans to adopt a universal birth dose policy, which is recommended by the World Health Organization, in 2027. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The award is in response to an “unsolicited proposal,” according to &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-23245.pdf?utm_campaign=pi+subscription+mailing+list&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=federalregister.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;documents&lt;/a&gt; in the Federal Register. The University of Southern Denmark, where Stabell Benn and Aaby are employed, confirmed to STAT that they are the recipients of the CDC grant. Stabell Benn has not responded to STAT’s interview requests. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Few details of the study design have been released. But &lt;a href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; from the Bandim Health Project said some babies will be randomly assigned to receive a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine at birth while others will receive the current standard of care to test for “overall health outcomes.” The statement from the CDC said the goal of the trial is to assess the hepatitis B birth dose’s impact on “early-life mortality, morbidity, and long-term developmental outcomes.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One vaccine expert told STAT that the projected length of the study — the funding is for five years — seemed well suited to capture potential risks of the vaccine but would be unable to quantify the benefits. That’s because the harms of being infected with hepatitis B early in infancy do not become apparent until later in life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The benefit of hepatitis B vaccine isn’t seen until decades later,” said William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center and professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “This is not a study designed to look at the benefits of the birth dose of hepatitis B, unless they’re looking for chronic hepatitis B infection, but they don’t explicitly say that.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, a panel that advises the CDC on vaccine policy &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/05/cdc-hepatitis-b-vaccination-acip-panel-overturns-30-year-policy/"&gt;voted to recommend&lt;/a&gt; doing away with the country’s universal hepatitis B vaccine birth dose policy. The decades-old policy, which was supported by myriad studies, has been &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/11/newborn-hep-b-vaccine-debate-how-it-started/"&gt;credited with driving down rates of hepatitis B infection in U.S. babies by 99%&lt;/a&gt;. Babies infected with the virus at birth or in their first year of life run a 90% risk of developing chronic hepatitis B infection, a condition that might not be diagnosed for years. About a quarter of those who do go on to die prematurely of liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Critics of the recommendation from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — which was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/16/hepatitis-b-vaccine-cdc-acip-recommendation-meets-resistance/"&gt;accepted this week by acting CDC Director Jim O’Neill&lt;/a&gt; — noted the change was not prompted by new evidence of dangers associated with the vaccine, or data questioning the effectiveness of the vaccine, but rather the objections of some parents to the policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stabell Benn and Aaby have long claimed some vaccines have impacts beyond protecting against a specific pathogen — so-called nonspecific effects. In some cases, they claim those effects are beneficial. But in others, they have reported negative nonspecific events. For instance, they suggest use of the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7252419/pdf/41577_2020_Article_338.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hepatitis B vaccine&lt;/a&gt; increases a child’s susceptibility to other pathogens, an effect they say is particularly apparent among girls. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X25012344?dgcid=author#bi0005" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;An analysis of their studies&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this year called into question many of the pair’s findings, saying they often claimed nonspecific effects that reexamination of the data did not support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is not known if the study the CDC is funding has cleared ethics approval at the University of Southern Denmark or by the health ministry of Guinea-Bissau.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But vaccine experts raised concern that randomly assigning some children not to be vaccinated at birth — especially in a country like Guinea-Bissau, which has a high prevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection — may be unethical. Some studies — several of which Aaby co-authored — have estimated between 13% and 18% of people in Guinea-Bissau are infected with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They are putting children at risk — and not an insubstantial proportion of children at risk — by not giving a birth dose,” Moss said. “This will obviously have to go through ethical review. I suspect it hasn’t done that yet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other experts questioned the idea of exposing children in a low-income country to a risk that one could not expose children to here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If the study design cannot be done in the United States because withholding the hepatitis B vaccine from newborns would violate ethical standards, then that raises serious concerns if the design is applied to infants in a lower-resource setting such as Guinea-Bissau,” said Zachary Rubin, a pediatrician and allergist-immunologist in the Chicago area.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;STAT asked the Department of Health and Human Services if it was ethical to conduct a study involving children in a low-income country that could not be conducted in the United States. In an emailed reply, spokesperson Emily Hilliard sidestepped that question, but insisted “we will ensure the highest scientific and ethical standards are met.” The study, Hilliard said, is designed “to fill existing evidence gaps to help inform global hepatitis B vaccine policy.’’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the differences between Guinea-Bissau and high-income countries like the United States are so substantial that any results seen there are not likely to be applicable here, a number of scientists warned. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Guinea-Bissau and the United States differ significantly in terms of infant mortality rates, causes of death, health care access, infectious disease burden, and maternal screening rates,” Rubin noted. “Even if the study determined that there was higher all-cause mortality in the vaccine group, that would not necessarily apply to the risk of the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose in American infants.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moss agreed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Those children in Guinea-Bissau are exposed to a whole different range and magnitude of pathogens that a child in the United States would not have,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researcher Stabell Benn has close ties to Høeg, an adviser to FDA Commissioner Marty Makary &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/11/tracy-beth-hoeg-fda-cder-director-faces-staff-mistrust/"&gt;who was recently named acting director of the agency’s drug center&lt;/a&gt;. The two have co-hosted a podcast together called “Vaccine Curious” where they compare vaccine policies in the U.S. and Denmark. Høeg is also the FDA’s representative on the CDC’s ACIP panel, where she recently pushed for the U.S. to reduce the number of vaccines it gives newborns. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stabell Benn &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/19/tracy-beth-hoeg-fda-advisor-marty-makary-vinay-prasad-vaccine-policy/"&gt;told STAT in April&lt;/a&gt; that she would like regulators to raise the bar on vaccines. She suggested asking companies to prove not only that their products introduce antibodies or reduce the risk of the target illness, but that they improve overall health.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is a misunderstood fear that if we start digging down and scrutinizing vaccine effects on overall health, then we might reveal something that could shatter confidence,” Stabell Benn said. “But it’s really not the way to deal with uncertainty. To say that if we are so afraid of what we are finding, we will just not study it. I can’t see any excuse.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stabell Benn and Aaby founded the Bandim Health Project group in 1978. Aaby was an anthropologist studying malnutrition when a measles outbreak hit and his team started vaccinating 1,500 children. The children didn’t die and in fact their mortality rate declined threefold compared to unvaccinated children, he recounted to &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/food/2019/12/vaccines-best-medicine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/a&gt; in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That experience made the two want to study the overall health effects of vaccines, both positive and negative. Kennedy has repeatedly &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LJXPOv4SM" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cited their research in interviews&lt;/a&gt;, particularly &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28188123/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an observational study&lt;/a&gt; showing an increase in mortality among children who received the DTP vaccine, which prevents diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The couple has &lt;a href="https://www.weekendavisen.dk/2025-08/samfund/et-daarligt-immunforsvar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;come under fire in the Danish press&lt;/a&gt; for failing to publish the results of a &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00244673?id=NCT00244673&amp;amp;rank=1&amp;amp;a=5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;separate randomized controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; they ran on the DTP vaccine in 2011, while touting the results of the observational study. Fellow Danish researchers have expressed &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X25012344" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;skepticism&lt;/a&gt; of the Bandim Health Project’s methods and conclusions, according to &lt;a href="https://www.weekendavisen.dk/ideer/en-udoedelig-hypotese" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;articles from Weekendavidsen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The couple told Weekendavidsen that they never published the results of the randomized trial due to a Ph.D. student’s pregnancy and the death of her field supervisor. The student “didn’t have time for long-term follow-up, and we didn’t have new resources to continue,” they said. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"When I was in my emergency medical services (EMS) class, my teacher brought in a death investigator and former autopsy examiner to speak to our class. She told us that while she worked as an autopsy examiner, she got this women who at the time mysteriously suffocated after a car accident. Apparently this women was driving, and while she was driving, she grabbed her lighter from her purse and was holding it in her mouth while she fumbled through her bag for her cigarettes. While doing this, she got T-boned. The airbag went off, and on the way to hospital, they kept trying to put tubes down her throat to open her airway, because she was having trouble breathing. But no luck. When they cut open her throat during the autopsy, they found her lighter jammed down there. Apparently when the airbag went off it got jammed down her throat and no one knew."&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a pair of groundbreaking studies, scientists replicated a time-consuming, laboratory-based, cancer therapy within myeloma patients’ own bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If standardized, such an advancement would allow for one of the most successful non-chemo cancer treatments to be done both faster and cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAR T-cell therapy involves retrieving a patient’s immune system component called a T-cell and using a virus to genetically add the CAR, or chimeric antigen receptor, to it. This process is done in a lab—typically outside the hospital where the patient is being treated—before the cells are shipped back for transplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alteration allows T-cells to home in on cancer cells directly by penetrating the biological stealth capabilities tumors have, but is also expensive and laborious. If, scientists have considered in the last decade, the process could be done inside the body, it would save lives that are sometimes lost waiting out the month-or-so-long process it takes to alter the T-cells in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what’s been established in a pair of recent trials, the results of which were just presented at the American Society of Hematology’s (ASH) annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the team’s first trial in July, 4 patients with multiple myeloma, a kind of blood cancer, had their T-cells engineered &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; with the CAR gene. They produced the altered cells, which successfully attacked the tumors in their bone marrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 of the patients seemed to be cured, with the cancer cells no longer detectable in their bone marrow, and a tell-tale circulating blood protein also absent from their bodies. 2 others didn’t benefit to that extent, but appeared to be in remission after 5 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The question is no longer can you really do this,” Yvonne Chen, a cancer immunotherapy researcher at UCLA, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/first-patients-have-been-helped-cancer-fighting-cells-made-directly-their-bodies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told Science News&lt;/a&gt;. “The question now is can you reach the level of efficacy that’s expected and will the safety profile meet the target.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the question of safety, the patients suffered from significant side effects, likely due to the effects of the deactivated virus used to reprogram their T-cells, which has been known to trigger flu-like symptoms that have even been fatal on occasion with the lab-based CAR T-cell method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the flu-like inflammation was very mild in all 4 patients, who instead suffered from drops in blood pressure, lack of oxygen, and mental confusion. All recovered following the treatment process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAR T-CELL THERAPY AT WORK: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Christmas ‘Miracle’ for 6-Year-Old with Leukemia Who’s Now Thriving After T-cell Therapy Instead of Chemo" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/christmas-miracle-for-6-year-old-with-leukemia-whos-now-thriving-after-t-cell-therapy-instead-of-chemo/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Christmas ‘Miracle’ for 6-Year-Old with Leukemia Who’s Now Thriving After T-cell Therapy Instead of Chemo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second trial, another 4 patients with previously untreatable multiple myeloma had no detectable cancer cells in their bone marrow 1 month after treatment, a status maintained in one patient 5-months post-treatment. The side effects were less substantive for unknown reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it gives us a glimpse into the future,” said hematologist Joy Ho of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. “&lt;em&gt;In vivo&lt;/em&gt; CAR-T for multiple myeloma is here and hopefully it will stay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANCER IMPROVEMENTS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Oncologists Treat Patient’s Rare Cancer with Isolated Chemotherapy Delivery, Preventing Side-Effects" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/oncologists-treat-patients-rare-cancer-with-isolated-chemotherapy-delivery-preventing-side-effects/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Oncologists Treat Patient’s Rare Cancer with Isolated Chemotherapy Delivery, Preventing Side-Effects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CAR T-cell therapy is also being looked at as a treatment for non-cancer diseases like autoimmune disorders. The lab-based process not only takes a month, but costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, and requires a particularly aggressive chemotherapy session to wipe out the existing T-cells before receiving the new, altered ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;em&gt;in vivo &lt;/em&gt;process can be rendered safer, it would allow hundreds more patients to access it, and save hundreds of lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer Research Gets Better And Better: LET YOUR FRIENDS KNOW… &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

All the patients received a standard, initial immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy between May 2019 and October 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each patient's average treatment time of day was calculated based on the first four therapy cycles. The researchers then compared survival outcomes for patients treated at different times of day, between 11 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. They matched the patients to ensure that the main thing that differed between them was the treatment timing, not baseline characteristics, such as age or sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 p.m. marked a critical cutoff point. Patients who generally received treatment before 3 p.m. survived significantly longer without their &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/cancer-facts-about-the-diseases-that-cause-out-of-control-cell-growth" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/cancer-facts-about-the-diseases-that-cause-out-of-control-cell-growth"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; progressing. They also had longer overall survival over the next five years, compared with those treated later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after accounting for other factors that could influence the patients' outcomes, this earlier treatment time remained a strong, independent predictor of better survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study findings align with laboratory studies that suggest killer T cells — immune cells that can directly kill cancer — tend to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-abstract/84/17/2756/747056/Clocking-Cancer-Immunotherapy-ResponsesTiming?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article-abstract/84/17/2756/747056/Clocking-Cancer-Immunotherapy-ResponsesTiming?redirectedFrom=fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;migrate into tumors in the morning&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bdp.jhu.edu/bd-professors/chi-van-dang/" target="_blank" data-url="https://bdp.jhu.edu/bd-professors/chi-van-dang/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Chi Van Dang&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of cancer medicine at Johns Hopkins University, who was not involved in the study. Therefore, aligning immunotherapy with this migration may help it work better, he told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-74a0ba1c-be1d-4b83-9e03-16dc9a635b44" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="personalized-chronotherapy-3"&gt;Personalized 'chronotherapy'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="e3cffbce-6015-4873-8c94-680a91a2274a"&gt;The large sample size of the study was a strength, but the research has some caveats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lévi pointed out that most patients were men, for example. The pronounced timing effects did not seem to extend to the women in the study, but this may come down to there being few women included, the study authors wrote, so it bears exploring in larger studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that patients who received immunochemotherapy before 3 p.m. lived nearly twice as long as those treated later in the afternoon. However, this picture isn't completely clear, Lévi said, because the study doesn't pinpoint the best cutoff time for care. "This results in an uncertainty regarding the most appropriate cut off time, that actually could be located between 11:30 and 15:00," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, because the study looked back at past patient data, stronger evidence will still need to come from randomized clinical trials, in which different treatment timings are explicitly tested and compared against one another. Most evidence of the benefits of early treatment "comes from retrospective studies," Innominato and colleagues said, "with only &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2025.43.16_suppl.8516" target="_blank" data-url="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2025.43.16_suppl.8516" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;one prospective trial completed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and additional trials now in development."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming trials show positive results, there could still be logistical hurdles to overcome. "If treatment were restricted to a single time window, such as the morning, clinical units could quickly become overwhelmed," Innominato and colleagues said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="cbc8e5d7-69bc-456e-9744-8e2e0282bbc5"&gt;It's important to note that the "optimal window" for treatment may not be universal among patients, they added. It may partially depend on each individual's biological rhythms and lifestyle characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronotyping — categorizing people as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/can-night-owls-become-early-birds.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/can-night-owls-become-early-birds.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;"morning larks" or a "night owls”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — could "align therapy with each patient's internal clock, accounting for individual variability and thus boosting efficacy while easing pressure on clinical units by distributing treatments across the day," they suggested. "The challenge now is to develop quick, reliable ways to identify chronotype and scale this approach, and dedicated studies are already underway."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="6401208e-96ee-4493-ae87-0120da614927"&gt;
