Mexico has seen at least 360 measles cases and one death, most of them in the northern state of Chihuahua, according to Mexican health authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Many of the communities grappling with measles have large Mennonite populations that public health officials have linked to outbreaks. The multinational resurgence has concerned epidemiologists, who fear that simultaneous outbreaks near the U.S. border will make it more difficult to contain the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“It’s just a line on the map that separates them — we share air, we share space,” said Lisa Lee, an epidemiologist at Virginia Tech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Falling vaccination rates have left the United States more vulnerable to the highly contagious virus, she added. “If we don’t have a buffer or herd immunity to keep the virus out,” she said, “we will be at risk as long as any of our neighbors are at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The outbreak in the Southwest shows no signs of slowing. Since late January, the virus has sickened more than 560 people in Texas, 63 people in neighboring New Mexico, and a dozen people in Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

But she wasn't prepared for what would come next: a diagnosis of stage 4 brain &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-522e5000-196a-11f0-9775-517d25900f2f" class="class"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; with scans showing a tumor the size of a small orange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The news was life-altering - and, within a week, she was rushed into surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It all just happened so fast,' Hulse told the Daily Mail. 'I went to seek medical help on the Monday, and I was in for surgery by Friday where I was told I might incur severe memory loss and need to learn how to talk again. I only developed symptoms over the course of the week.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Mayo Clinic, tumors in the lower part of the brain (the temporal lobe) can trigger memory problems, as it's where memories and senses are processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hulse's cancer story and the chain of events leading to her diagnosis echoes that of&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/real-housewives-of-beverly-hills/index.html" id="mol-c118fd50-e984-11ef-aae7-916fe6822554" class="class"&gt;Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; star's &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/teddi-mellencamp/index.html" id="mol-c0f807d0-e984-11ef-aae7-916fe6822554" class="class"&gt;Teddi Mellencamp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like Hulse, Mellencamp's brain cancer had progressed to an advanced stage before being detected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;When Jennifer Hulse started having trouble remembering the name of her boyfriend, she knew there was something drastically wrong. She later discovered she had stage 4 brain cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After getting the life-changing news, Hulse said it was all a blur and she was rushed in for surgery the same week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The TV star also said she suffered from 'debilitating' headaches for a short time before doctors discovered &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/tvshowbiz/article-14390875/teddi-mellencamp-surgery-tumors-brain.html"&gt;several malignant masses in her brain&lt;/a&gt; that they believed had been growing for around six months. And, like Hulse, the 43-year-old TV star had no family history of cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Mellencamp's case, the tumors were the result of skin cancer spreading throughout her body. She continues to fight the disease following numerous surgeries and rounds of chemotherapy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hulse, on the other hand, was diagnosed with glioblastoma - one of the most aggressive and fast-growing forms of brain cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each year, more than 13,000 Americans are diagnosed with glioblastoma. The survival rate is bleak, with only around 5 percent living longer than five years after diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite that devastating diagnosis, Hulse responded well to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors were able to stabilize her condition, though glioblastoma is known for recurring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hulse's is the same type of cancer that claimed the lives of Senators John McCain and Ted Kennedy, as well as President Joe Biden's son, Beau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment typically begins with surgery to remove the tumor (a craniotomy), followed by intensive radiation and chemotherapy to get rid of anything that's left. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average survival time after diagnosis is just 12 to 18 months, with those in advanced stages often falling toward the lower end of that range. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After undergoing surgery in February 2017, Hulse began a grueling course of radiation and chemotherapy, which lasted for several months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Miracously, Hulse said the surgeons were able to remove her tumor in one go and she did not experience any memory loss upon waking up after the operation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I was told that I might not be able to speak, but, if anything, my memory felt much sharper,' she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I was born in Colombia and grew up in Germany, and I could still speak Spanish and German no problem after the surgery, which I was relieved about.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hulse was diagnosed with glioblastoma, which is a highly aggressive and fast-growing form of cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hulse said: 'My boyfriend, Lloyd, was a real rock for me and I will be eternally grateful to all of the doctors.' Lloyd is now her husband&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Some of the side effects Hulse suffers from include exhaustion and she has lost the hair on the left side of her head from the chemotherapy treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As she had only been dating her boyfriend, Lloyd, for four months before getting her cancer diagnosis, she says that she half expected him to leave - she even gave him the option. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, he stuck by her side and sold his house so they could move into together.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Among the lingering side effects of her treatment, Hulse has lost the hair on the left side of her head as a side effect of the chemotherapy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, she has found that extensions do a great job at covering the area where her hair is thinner.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Radiation therapy also left her with a rare and painful complication: exposed bone in her ear canal, a condition known as osteoradionecrosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the American Head and Neck Society, roughly 4 to 8 percent of people with head and neck cancers develop this condition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To manage it, Hulse was prescribed antibiotics and has to regularly monitor her ear to make sure an infection doesn't develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with the negatives, Hulse says one of the positive 'superpowers' she now has is that she can 'fall asleep in just two seconds!' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the physical toll, she says the experience has changed her profoundly - and for the better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cancer has made me a better person and more appreciative of every moment in life,' she told the Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've come to understand that it's not luck, but the grace of God, that allows me to be here. I thought I was humble before all of this, but I realize now that I wasn't humble enough.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;More than 13,000 Americans are diagnosed with glioblastoma every year and only around five per cent of those with this type of brain tumor survive longer than five years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hulse's brain cancer was in its advanced stages like the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star's Teddi Mellencamp (pictured)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some cancer patients report experiencing 'cancer ghosting' - when friends or loved ones withdraw or cut off contact after a diagnosis - Hulse said she was fortunate to be surrounded by unwavering support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was something that really helped get me through everything,' she told the Daily Mail. 'I had an amazing support system between my friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My boyfriend, Lloyd, was a real rock for me, and I will be eternally grateful to all of the doctors.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hulse and Lloyd married four years after her cancer battle, and she says they both share the same upbeat attitude about life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eight years on, she still undergoes MRI scans every four months to monitor for any signs of the cancer returning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has also chosen not to have children as the hormonal changes that come with pregnancy could spur on the disease's reemergence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her message to others is simple but powerful: 'Watch the words you say, and say thank you every day. My cancer diagnosis has taught me that life can change in a second.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 18:25:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQdlhrOXVWaHBSZ2VRQVFIdTlWLVkzM0FhdWhTWUZTeGYzWjJ6VzUzT3E2V3ZNYVN2YXlzcDZWZGxobEhRYmNHZk9lVmFUSWppM1Z2dWZMVTZEd1Nyd2M1UlAxR0hxbDhSTmp6cHA3eHBlWkFNaUtNRE1zNmNBVVM1Z3BXeVJZRTFFaE0xUXVMLUZBM2M</guid></item><item><title>帮助我在没有节食的情况下减掉20磅的欧洲“怪癖” —一次转变改变了一切-纽约邮报 | The European ‘quirks’ that helped me lose 20 lbs. without dieting — one shift changed everything - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxPS1FObVZWNVFvSXdDcDdYMldWRlBTUUVBWk9GNnNaaVFlQnROVjVPSmNrQUVHRlRxZTVzTWF0ZS1uSVZxVndKdHRhSmJjVXpCR01xZmFVRFI5d1c1cWRKTUxxSTBPaks5N0w3TkpBeFNoTUNhckFOb1d2eDMzU1RDdktQXzRkV25PTmNPMGg0TV9Ya3pYSXdqT0ltWEhISi0w?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;An American content creator who relocated to Portugal was surprised to discover several simple lifestyle “quirks” that helped her lose 20 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.coachviva.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Richa Prasad&lt;/a&gt;, 39, moved from Seattle to Portugal two years ago, she found that her consumption habits clashed with local traditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’d walk around with a drink in hand, sometimes even having my lunch on the go. I felt it was productive to knock out two tasks at the same time, but I noticed people kept giving me weird looks. Turns out nobody in Europe walks and eats,” she recently explained in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u02Hlm0BG_c" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;video posted to YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prasad noted that even on workdays in Europe, meals are seated affairs that last one to three hours — not because people are eating more, but because they’re pacing themselves through conversation. She learned that the same ethos applies to drinking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Content creator Richa Prasad believes the US is a nation of extremes that could benefit from a less severe approach to wellness. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Ekaterina Pokrovsky – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In Seattle, nights out meant slamming drinks. In Europe, people nurse their drinks for hours,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This slow, steady, savor mindset extends beyond eating and drinking and into workflow as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Whenever I meet new people in Europe, nobody ever asks me, ‘What do you do?’ In the US, that’s the first thing people want to know…In Europe, work is just one part of life, like going to a cafe. There’s no urgency, no drama,” she shared.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prasad believes the US is a nation of extremes that could benefit in mind, body and spirit from a less severe approach to wellness.&lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;“It’s shifting our mindset from dramatic high-stakes sprints to steady, consistent marches, meaning you commit to no longer pendulum swinging between being on a diet or completely off the rails,” she said. “Meal prepping with military precision or bingeing on takeout when life gets busy, then doing hardcore workouts as punishment for the binge.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prasad said that Europeans tend to eschew diets for consistency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They just exist in a steady rhythm, and that’s the shift that changed everything for me.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In accordance with that steady rhythm, she noticed that Europeans who lose weight do so without measures like restrictive dieting, extreme fasting or keto eating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prasad maintained that most Europeans eat according to the principle of pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Europeans eat real butter, full-fat cheese and croissants without guilt. They don’t eat with a restrictive mentality where, even as you’re digging into that croissant, every bite is taken with guilt, because guess what happens when you eat with guilt: you don’t enjoy it, you’re never satisfied.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Does this mean we should all abandon ourselves to rich eating and a daily dose of butter and bread?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Yes and no,” she confessed. “Because if you love food, you should eat real food that nourishes your body.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/lifestyle/ultraprocessed-foods-are-everywhere-how-bad-are-they/"&gt;Ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) make up about 60% of the US diet&lt;/a&gt; compared to just 14% of European diets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;UPFs have been linked to a host of adverse health effects, from obesity and diabetes to heart disease, depression, dementia and more. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/09/health/these-processed-foods-could-lead-to-early-death-study-says/"&gt;A 2024 study&lt;/a&gt; suggested that eating these foods may raise the risk of premature death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prasad recommended we emulate our European counterparts and aim to reduce our junk food intake from 60% to 14%.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Most junk and sweets we eat tend to be out of cravings, not hunger,” she said. “So if we reduce the number of times we give in to cravings, the amount of junk we eat will all go down.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/12/17/health/american-adults-eat-extra-meal-each-day-in-junk-food-study/"&gt;A 2023 study&lt;/a&gt; found American adults average four meals a day — with one consisting entirely of junk food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to reducing or eliminating junk food, Prasad suggested cutting back on snacking, as most Europeans observe meal times and refrain from grazing in between.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By and large, they don’t snack. They tend to eat at set meal times and engage in mini-intermittent fasting, lasting three to four hours between meals,” she revealed. “This, in turn, reduces the chances of giving in to cravings because you’re no longer making a decision every time an urge to eat strikes you.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prasad said these set meals should prioritize the inclusion of “one palm-sized portion of lean protein, one fistful of vegetables and one cup of water first. After that, you can eat whatever you want without guilt.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Prasad suggests setting a timer to ensure your meal lasts at least 20 minutes and is free from distractions, such as screen time.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Davide Angelini – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;She encouraged setting a timer to ensure your meal lasts at least 20 minutes and is free from distractions, such as screen time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/16/health/being-distracted-during-a-meal-can-lead-to-overeating-study/"&gt;2024 study &lt;/a&gt;found that&lt;/span&gt; people who ate while distracted reported less enjoyment and satisfaction, a greater desire for further gratification and increased snacking afterward. Researchers call this phenomenon “hedonic compensation” — making up for the loss of pleasure by seeking extra gratification elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to mindful eating practices, Prasad wants Americans to incorporate more physical activity into their daily lives, but to avoid intense, hunger-spiking exercise that’s more about punishment than pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Instead of parking close to your building entrance, park far away and walk. Instead of taking the elevator, take the stairs,” she urged. “Drive to a park close to you and go for a walk as many times a week as you can.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She also suggests experimenting with different sports until you find one you really enjoy — and then optimizing your engagement for enjoyment, not improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unsung appendage in the female body, which has long been considered useless, may actually be essential for ovary development and fertility, a new mouse study finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This structure, called the rete ovarii, was first discovered in humans over a century ago, but until now, it was considered a so-called vestigial structure — not crucial in adult female anatomy, but a leftover from fetal development. Vestigial anatomical structures, or "vestiges," are generally thought to have once had a crucial function that was later lost in the course of human evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But according to a new study, published March 19 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96662#content" target="_blank" data-url="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96662#content" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eLife&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the rete ovarii (RO) may actually play an important role in ovarian function, and therefore, fertility. The work also showed that the structure has three distinct regions and may respond to hormonal signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The female reproductive tract is often thought to consist of the vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus, oviduct, and ovaries," the researchers wrote in their paper. "We suggest that the RO be added to this list and investigated as an additional component of female reproductive function."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although their study is based in mice, the researchers think it likely applies to people because the structure is also present in a number of other mammal species, including cows, cats, sheep, pigs, dogs and monkeys. Additionally, humans and mice share similar early sex-organ development pathways, so the scientists assume that the structure and its developmental cues might be similar&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/useless-human-body-parts" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/useless-human-body-parts"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 body parts that are useless in humans (or maybe not)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RO is a horseshoe-shaped network of tubes nestled beneath the ovary, at the site where blood vessels and nerves enter the organ. However, despite the structure being highly conserved among mammals, when it was first found in humans in 1870, scientists &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rediscovered-organ-ovary-function" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rediscovered-organ-ovary-function" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;deemed it to have no use&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-L27uBnbJFSWL2Yf3HTbxrZ" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-L27uBnbJFSWL2Yf3HTbxrZ slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When this structure was first discovered in the late 1800s it was assumed that it had no purpose because scientists couldn't see its function within the body," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/people/adam-taylor(833b737c-bf8e-4ef8-9eff-2b2864e24d6b).html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/people/adam-taylor(833b737c-bf8e-4ef8-9eff-2b2864e24d6b).html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adam Taylor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of anatomy at Lancaster University who was not involved with the recent study, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, "scientists also didn't have the same imaging, microscopic and molecular techniques available today," Taylor added. "These enable us to detect changes in blood flow, size changes of internal structures during life or ability to detect the proteins produced by the rete ovarii and compare these to similar ones produced elsewhere in the body where the function is known."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, in the new paper, researchers have applied modern methods to grant new insight into the RO. Some of their experiments used living mice, so that the researchers could study how the RO develops in the womb. Other tissues analyzed in the study were collected from euthanized animals after death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that the RO contains three distinct regions that mature during fetal development and then are maintained in adulthood. These regions include the intraovarian rete (IOR), located within the ovary itself; the extraovarian rete (EOR), made of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106648" target="_blank" data-url="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106648" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;convoluted tubules that join up into a bulb at one end&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; and the connecting rete (CR), a transitional zone between the IOR and EOR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mass spectrometry — a technique used to identify and quantify molecules — the researchers discovered that, at birth, the EOR contains thousands of proteins within its tubes that its own cells appear to produce. One protein was insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), may be involved in ovary function. The protein may modulate the availability and activity of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), which are structurally similar to insulin and important for the development of the follicles that carry immature eggs and hormones in the ovary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other experiments, the researchers watched fluorescent dye move through the EOR, revealing that fluid within the EOR is propelled toward the ovary. This further suggests that the RO has a role in ovarian function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another analysis, they found that the cells of the RO expressed, or switched on, genes that code for a variety of hormone receptors, including receptors for the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone. These hormones play important roles in female reproduction and health, helping to orchestrate the menstrual cycle, among other jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It appears that the rete ovarii may have a role in ovarian homeostasis - maintaining the ovaries and their environment," Taylor suggested. "Similarly they appear to be able to detect fluid movement in and around the ovaries and their microenvironment. Finally and most interestingly is the potential endocrine [hormonal] role that the rete ovarii may have."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the study suggest that the EOR may "act as an antenna" to receive signals from the rest of the body, both via hormones and nerves, and then send that information on to the ovary via the proteins it secretes and transports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's still so much we can't even begin to comprehend about female anatomy," study lead author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dilara-Anbarci'" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dilara-Anbarci'" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dilara Anbarci&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a developmental biologist at the University of Michigan, told &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rediscovered-organ-ovary-function" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rediscovered-organ-ovary-function" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Science News&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "I hope this encourages more investigation in reevaluating what we don't already know about the ovary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope to further investigate the function and component structures of the rete ovarii, looking into how the EOR actually responds to hormones and whether the proteins it secretes change in response to changes in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research challenges the traditional view of the RO being considered redundant, proposing instead that it has a secret wealth of functions. Figuring out how the rete ovarii works could one day help scientists better understand and treat conditions of the female reproductive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The endocrine system plays a key role in gynaecological health," Taylor said. "A greater understanding of any structures in this region has the potential to open up new therapeutic avenues and opportunities in treating various conditions."&lt;/p&gt;

The lab was also about to begin developing a rapid toxicity test for chemicals that US troops may be exposed to while they are deployed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Mandler says he was researching why some people who manufacture, cut, and install stone countertops were starting to get silicosis—a potentially fatal lung scarring and inflammation disease that makes it difficult to breathe—after just a few years on the job. Generally, he says, workers tend to get the disease after spending decades in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“I have listened to men younger than me sit across the table and talk about how they feel like they're drowning in their own lungs because of these exposures, and they can’t see their children grow up,” Mandler says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;He adds that some of the NIOSH staffers who lost their jobs were testing how lung tissue reacts after being exposed to the dust from different brands of commercial synthetic quartz. The material, commonly used in countertops, is thought to cause more severe lung damage than exposure to pure natural quartz, Mandler says. He believes something in the manufacturing process may be to blame, but now that his research team at NIOSH has been dismantled, Mandler fears it will take longer for the scientific community to find the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Three Morgantown researchers who were affected by the job cuts tell WIRED that they have not received any information about who would be in charge of the facility’s biological samples after the reduction in force, how custody of them could be transferred, or what their ultimate fate may be. Since entire divisions at NIOSH were eliminated, one researcher says, they don’t even know who could take responsibility for the samples they oversaw at the facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Another researcher says that when the layoffs happened, the only instruction they received was “to destroy our purchase and travel cards, and maintenance was available to help us take personal items to our cars.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The researcher says that CDC guidelines direct employees to keep physical samples and accompanying personally-identifiable information under lock and key, and only certain authorized staff are permitted to access them. “My colleagues and I took this responsibility very seriously,” the researcher tells WIRED. “Many are worried about samples and what will become of them, sensitive and otherwise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Even before the recent reduction in force, Mandler and two other laid off researchers say that a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/federal-spending-freeze-could-have-widespread-impact-on-environment-emergency-management/"&gt;federal spending freeze&lt;/a&gt; ordered by the Trump administration in January had reduced the Morgantown facility’s supply of liquid nitrogen to “critical” levels.

            That’s according to a &lt;a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rCyMaWR6YzcrFLdY-2BewLqzQf8kGCSsRSfetYJxDhxrPNoX7K384p48FRArRmOZ4-2Fa8vXTVs0mywaCxtlZ28I6M74-3DLD0I_sGhGCVpwFe-2F7omibEFFkS2OLk-2BdOXuEASIRdx2x8JgEFQyU0wnkVnFTYr98WHiItd5mAU-2BAp3fGMKwThCzfas-2BIy2J5J2TQRaHk0rY-2BYi8gC68WDt7KNqJGjf671sFq0e0Xs3pg5pF9nhn8DVh656Ti2rfnSXtbdBEwWHiZ6csxqQum-2F-2BMq0F36e46-2Fk5QoBHvcGkF0aAKkDYSUvmF14R2g83AxMzTVtO8c339u0TDG2ej3v6TOxhP-2F9NbUp20N-2FkTFvAaxdD1XUvAP6Rj1E1nuzeNj-2BOjY-2FB-2B1Dy25MYMxay17o9UNbhn2W2BTn6lQq8syIdxHB12HizSygR7oI-2FVa7SWNkc4rDO-2FiMqdVkGfY-3D" target="_blank"&gt;large new study&lt;/a&gt; published Tuesday in the journal Heart, which found average or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/10/health/walking-fitness-new-years-resolutions-wellness/index.html"&gt;brisk walking paces&lt;/a&gt; were associated with 35% and 43% lower risks of all heart rhythm abnormalities studied, respectively, compared with a slow pace.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl500093b6oeofyzvzq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those abnormalities are the arrhythmias: atrial fibrillation, bradyarrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias. Atrial fibrillation, or A-fib, is the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16765-atrial-fibrillation-afib#:~:text=Atrial%20fibrillation%20(Afib)%20is%20an,artery%20disease%20and%20having%20obesity." target="_blank"&gt;most common arrhythmia&lt;/a&gt;, characterized by an irregular and rapid heartbeat beginning in the upper chambers, or atria, of the heart. Bradyarrhythmias &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23349-bradyarrhythmia" target="_blank"&gt;are abnormally slow&lt;/a&gt; heart rates of typically below 60 beats per minute, compared with the normal range of 60 to 100 beats per minute. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21854-ventricular-arrhythmia#:~:text=What%20can%20cause%20a%20ventricular,Medications." target="_blank"&gt;Ventricular arrhythmias occur&lt;/a&gt; when the lower chambers of the heart, or ventricles, beat too fast.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000a3b6onhu8nwz6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The great thing about walking is that it is accessible to everyone,” said senior study author Dr. Jill Pell, the Henry Mechan Professor of Public Health at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, via email. “You don’t need to spend money going to a gym or buying equipment. You can just walk out of your front door and keep going.”&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000b3b6oa6fj9kec@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nearly 60 million people worldwide have atrial fibrillation, according &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(23)00205-3/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;to a 2024 study&lt;/a&gt;. Estimates of people with other arrhythmias are less conclusive, but in general, people with arrhythmias are at higher risk of having heart attacks or strokes and dying early, Pell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000c3b6owugpdl5t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are medicines and procedures that can be offered to these people but it would be preferable to prevent heart rhythm abnormalities from occurring in the first place,” Pell added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000d3b6olxy30agl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, to the authors’ knowledge, there has been only one previous study on walking pace and heart rhythm abnormalities, and it focused on just one type of arrhythmia, Pell said. And past research has indicated that “walking pace is linked to other outcomes such as cardiovascular disease, so we wanted to see if the same was true of heart rhythm abnormalities,” Pell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000e3b6oyoy8apaw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The authors studied health and activity data from adults who had been recruited between 2006 and 2010 for the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/learn-more-about-uk-biobank/about-us#:~:text=Since%202006%2C%20UK%20Biobank%20has,a%20large%2Dscale%20prospective%20study." target="_blank"&gt;UK Biobank study&lt;/a&gt;, which has followed the health outcomes of more than 500,000 people between the ages 40 and 69 in the United Kingdom. Participants answered questionnaires that asked whether their walking pace was slow (less than 3 miles or 4.8 kilometers per hour), average (3 to 4 miles or 4.8 to 6.4 kilometers per hour) or brisk (more than 4 miles or 6.4 kilometers per hour).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000f3b6oi3ptkwha@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During a follow-up period of 13 years on average, 9% of participants developed arrhythmias.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000g3b6oze2lxyxv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We had data on self-reported walking pace from more than 420,000 people but we also had accelerometry data on (nearly) 82,000 of these,” Pell said, referring to data from watches that track movement speed. “The data from the watches showed that walking at an average pace (3-4 miles per hour) for only 5-15 minutes per day was sufficient to reduce your risk.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000h3b6obuc5o609@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The associations were strongest among people under 60, people without obesity, those with high blood pressure or two or more preexisting conditions, and women, the authors found. &lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000i3b6opm18lpgd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is an interesting finding because, although women are less likely to get atrial fibrillation than men, when they do get it they are at a higher risk of going on to get heart attacks and strokes than men with atrial fibrillation,” Pell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000j3b6ogv0ogmya@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cardiologist Dr. Martha Gulati found the study important and said it confirms earlier related research — by herself and others — that showed benefits of physical activity for atrial fibrillation and stronger associations among women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000k3b6o83zchkw1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This shows that one of the primary prevention strategies to reduce cardiac arrhythmias is brisk walking,” added Gulati, director of preventive cardiology at the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Gulati wasn’t involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Since the study is observational, it doesn’t prove a cause and effect, the authors said. Self-reported health data is also vulnerable to inaccurate recollections or biases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000m3b6own7otbck@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In observational studies, there’s always a risk that people who walk slower do so because they already have disease, Pell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000n3b6o3qwxd9t9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We did everything possible to avoid this by making sure that no one had any type of heart or vascular disease at the beginning of the study,” she added. “However, we really need an intervention study now to confirm our findings: a study of people who walk slowly in which some are asked to increase their walking pace and some are not,” Pell said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000o3b6ozao0b8z4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A-Fib is associated with multiple risk factors that are also linked with conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, said Dr. Sean Heffron, director of cardiovascular fitness and nutrition at the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at New York University. He was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000p3b6oe34x8uzf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Participants who walked faster were more likely to be men, live in less deprived areas, have healthier lifestyles and weigh less. They also had better grip strength, smaller waists and lower levels of inflammation and metabolic risk factors such as high cholesterol or blood sugar.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000q3b6ok89f1ay0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And bradyarrhythmias or ventricular arrhythmias are nonspecific and can have lots of other causes and certainly are far less clearly associated with lifestyle-type factors than is atrial fibrillation,” Heffron added. “I feel like lumping them all together was interesting.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000r3b6omfvwwhb0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The authors found that over one-third of the beneficial effect of a faster pace “was due to the fact that walking faster reduces cholesterol, glucose and blood pressure and makes you less likely to put on weight,” Pell said, noting that those reductions lower your risk of heart rate abnormalities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9k6nfl5000s3b6ouksffdfo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Though a brisk pace seems to be better than a slow pace, “the first step is literally a step,” Gulati said. “Walking slow is how we start, but the more you do it, the faster your pace will become.”

Measles causes a respiratory illness with high fevers, tiredness, painful runny nose, cough and red eyes, followed by a characteristic rash. If not immune, 90% of people exposed to measles will get sick from the virus. Measles can be especially severe in young infants and those with a compromised immune system. A measles infection can lead to bacterial pneumonia, low oxygen levels that require hospital care and brain inflammation. Measles can be deadly in infants and for kids, one to three out of 1,000 will die if unvaccinated. Years after a measles infection, a fatal neurologic disease called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) can develop, and there is no cure. Measles during pregnancy can result in stillbirth. Additionally, pregnant people also can become severely ill or die from measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: Why do measles outbreaks occur?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus. It can linger in the air for hours after an infected person has been in a given space. One person can infect up to 18 unvaccinated persons who have been in the same location. Because this virus is so contagious, having strong population-based immunity to measles is critical to preventing outbreaks. The most recent large outbreak of measles is due to vaccination rates dropping below 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: Is measles preventable?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: In the U.S., the measles vaccine is included in the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine or MMR plus varicella (MMR-V) vaccine. Healthy children and adults who have received two doses of the vaccine, spaced by at least four weeks between doses, need not worry about contracting measles or passing this virus on to others. Children who have received at least one dose and are not yet due for their second dose are also protected. People who received one dose of the vaccine and are overdue for the second dose may be at increased risk. A second dose is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__FlexBase-sc-1fnzlkn-1 jGlKin adWrapper" aria-label="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;Vitamin A does not prevent measles, only the MMR vaccine can prevent measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: What are the best ways to protect myself from measles?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: Vaccination is the most effective and complete way to protect yourself, your loved ones and your community from measles. Very young infants and those who are immunocompromised may be eligible for a measles antibody (immune globulin) injection, but the antibody is not widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: Is the MMR vaccine safe for all children and adults?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: The MMR vaccine is safe and effective for healthy individuals 6 months of age or older. The vaccine is not safe for those with certain types of immune deficiency, including advanced HIV/AIDS and anyone who has had an organ transplant or is undergoing chemotherapy. Just like any vaccine, the MMR vaccine can cause temporary side effects (fever, localized pain/redness), and, rarely, can cause a measles-like rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: Given the measles spread, should children be vaccinated earlier than scheduled?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: The only time children will need an accelerated schedule is if they will become immunosuppressed (undergoing chemotherapy, starting immunosuppressant medications, expecting a bone marrow or organ transplant or anticipated use of high-dose steroids for conditions such as asthma), or if they’ll be traveling overseas for an extended period. Contact your pediatrician for more information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: Can you still get measles despite being fully vaccinated?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: The MMR vaccine has an efficacy rate of 97%. If you are fully vaccinated, you are very unlikely to contract measles. If you do, you are very unlikely to become seriously ill from the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: If I had two doses of MMR vaccine, do I need a booster?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: Most people who received both doses will not need a booster. If you are unsure if you have received the MMR vaccine, your primary care provider can order a blood test to confirm protective immunity. People who received the MMR vaccine between 1963 and 1967 likely received an inactivated measles vaccine. They should receive at least one additional dose of the current vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: If an adult had measles as a child, is a booster needed?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: Anyone with a prior measles infection does not need to receive the MMR vaccine. A measles infection induces lifelong immunity (just like the vaccine). Because measles was so prevalent before the MMR vaccine was released, most people born before 1957 were infected during childhood, and therefore, are now considered immune. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: What if someone under 6 months of age comes in contact with measles?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: If the community has at least 95% immunity to measles, it is very unlikely that the youngest infants will be exposed to the virus because there is excellent “herd immunity.” Infants with an increased risk of exposure, such as those who live in or travel to an area with a known outbreak, can receive an antibody (immune globulin) injection to provide four to six months of immunity. This injection, available at some health departments, is not a substitute for vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: How should I handle a measles exposure?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: How you should respond to a measles exposure depends on the vaccine and health status of the exposed person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 kDvXdO font_openSans articleList"&gt;&lt;li class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 ecGWWE iQviKm"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 hxqFXA fYWDEy"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 6 6" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;circle cx="3" cy="3" r="3" fill="#212121"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;span class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 gJUqRf"&gt;Healthy individuals who have received two doses of MMR do not need to take any further measures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 ecGWWE iQviKm"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 hxqFXA fYWDEy"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 6 6" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;circle cx="3" cy="3" r="3" fill="#212121"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;span class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 gJUqRf"&gt;Healthy individuals who have received one dose of MMR and are due or overdue for a second dose should receive the second dose as soon as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 ecGWWE iQviKm"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 hxqFXA fYWDEy"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 6 6" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;circle cx="3" cy="3" r="3" fill="#212121"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;span class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 gJUqRf"&gt;Healthy individuals who have received no doses of MMR should be vaccinated as soon as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 ecGWWE iQviKm"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 hxqFXA fYWDEy"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 6 6" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;circle cx="3" cy="3" r="3" fill="#212121"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;span class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 gJUqRf"&gt;Healthy individuals who are too young to receive the MMR vaccine, pregnant people or those who have a severely compromised immune system (with or without prior complete vaccination) should contact their primary care provider or local health departments as soon as possible to determine if treatment with measles immune globulin would be beneficial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;If you are concerned that you may have measles or have been exposed, please call ahead of time before seeking treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__HeadingBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 bXHBTg article-header"&gt;Q: What is the current status of measles outbreaks in the U.S.?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A: Measles had been previously eliminated in the U.S.; however, there have been outbreaks over the past decade.

In a chocolate tasting study, participants from higher socio-economic backgrounds showed stronger alignment between their internal hunger signals and food intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds did not show the same physiological regulation, despite similar levels of consumption. This study suggests that bodily signals for hunger and satiety may function differently depending on socio-economic conditions, providing insight into health disparities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vagal Tone Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher vagal activity predicted eating behavior only in participants from wealthier backgrounds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weaker Regulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Internal signals of hunger and fullness were less predictive in participants from lower socio-economic groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; These differences may contribute to dietary inequalities and long-term health disparities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Durham University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Food Quality and Preference&lt;/em&gt;, the research highlights how physiological signals, particularly those transmitted via the vagus nerve, interact with socio-economic factors to shape dietary behaviour. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 96 students from diverse socio-economic backgrounds who participated in a chocolate tasting session.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108855"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows people eating." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/vagus-nerve-diet-socioeconomic-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While the research focused specifically on chocolate consumption as a model for eating behaviour, the implications may extend to other types of food and dietary patterns. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a controlled laboratory setting, each participant was presented with a plate containing 70 milk chocolate pieces and invited to sample and rate them at their leisure.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers measured each student’s heart rate variability (HRV) as a proxy for the activity of the vagus nerve – a part of the nervous system that regulates appetite and digestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s lead author, Professor Mario Weick of Durham University’s Department of Psychology, explained: “The findings suggest that while the vagus nerve plays a key role in transmitting signals between the gut and the brain, the extent to which these signals guide eating behaviour can vary with one’s socio-economic status.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research indicates that internal signals may be more closely aligned with eating behaviour in individuals from higher socio-economic backgrounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In contrast, those from lower socio-economic groups appear to show a weaker link between these physiological signals and their food consumption.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research builds on longstanding theories regarding the impact of socio-economic factors on health and dietary habits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, disparities in diet have been attributed to differences in food access and external factors.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this study shifts the focus towards internal regulatory processes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data revealed that participants from more advantaged backgrounds consumed more or less chocolate depending on their vagal tone, which can signal both hunger and satiety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, in individuals from less advantaged backgrounds, this physiological regulation was not as evident.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Milica Vasiljevic of Durham University, the study’s co-author added: “Our study does not support the idea that individuals from lower socio-economic groups eat more or are inherently more impulsive.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather, it highlights that the internal regulation of eating – how our bodies naturally signal when to eat and when to stop – may function differently depending on our socio-economic backgrounds.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could have important implications for understanding broader health inequalities.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the research focused specifically on chocolate consumption as a model for eating behaviour, the implications may extend to other types of food and dietary patterns.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research is needed to explore whether similar patterns are observed across different populations and with other food categories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work marks a significant step forward in disentangling the complex relationship between socio-economic status, physiological regulation, and dietary habits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By bringing attention to the role of internal bodily signals in shaping eating behaviour, the research offers new perspectives for developing public health strategies that address dietary inequalities and associated long-term health outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and neuroscience

consumption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socio-economic status (SES) correlates with patterns of food consumption, yet the underlying physiological mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examines how SES modulates the relationship between vagal tone, a physiological marker of self-regulation, and chocolate consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different hypotheses about how SES may be linked to vagal regulation of chocolate consumption were put to a test in a laboratory study with a socio-economically diverse group of students (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 96).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vagal tone was assessed using an index of heart rate variability (HRV–HF) measured at rest (baseline) and during acute stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants’ chocolate consumption was measured using a bogus taste test. The results showed that socio-economic status interacted with vagal tone to influence chocolate consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings for both subjective and objective indicators of SES converged in showing that vagal tone predicted chocolate consumption among higher SES participants, with higher vagal tone associated with lower chocolate consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No such relationship was found in lower SES participants, suggesting a dissociation between vagal regulation and eating behaviour in this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the importance of considering autonomic regulation in understanding socio-economic disparities in dietary behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:23:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5tSzJURDNna2hYaXVUYUhIbWFSQVQ5N2hEZDRuaHoxNTZJRVNTZ01mTDR6WXFITnRYWnJ4TktwdzVncnhkNnBibE5oZlZKUk9DY1lLWlBkVThUXzUzM3lwOXppYUg5a0RDRVc0MGNteUJ1bHB5</guid></item><item><title>推动这三只股票的血液测试革命-投资者商业日报 | The Blood Test Revolution Driving These Three Stocks - Investor's Business Daily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxQNV85TU1MbHhTX0xsQTFsUVJlQTUtVjJGQ3JET3YwcEpDYjY0NG01enJWSE52T1JtZDZ6UkdJZWtCWmNrUFEyRTE4R2FsZUd6ckJVbmtvZkcwTnRlRUl0NktEOHQ3aklCUFFrM2ZHVDFxSWozbVM1SjdBbTRmYXpKbXd3TUNzSTRuYWE4Q1pZN3g5ZEJKM3lGUW40RHVCUktETW5jNlIwZGptY29QVGdMWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single-post-content post-content drop-cap crawler"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer rates are on the rise, particularly in young people. And when it comes to cancer, it's a no brainer that the earlier a patient undergoes treatment the better the chance they have of surviving. Guardant, Natera and Exact are blazing trails in the use of blood tests to detect cancer relapses months sooner than traditional technology. They do this by looking for tumor DNA in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even a low level of tumor DNA in the blood is dangerous, says Richard Chen, chief medical officer for &lt;strong&gt;Personalis&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PSNL" target="_blank"&gt;PSNL&lt;/a&gt;), a small biotech company that sells a minimal residual disease, or MRD, test called NeXT Personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It means that the cancer is there, it's festering and there's a good chance it's going to expand and recur for the patient," he told Investor's Business Daily. "Yes, I think it is a five-alarm fire in the sense that if you don't do anything about it and leave it alone, (immune system) surveillance is not necessarily going to take care of it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market is &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/27/3002196/28124/en/Minimal-Residual-Disease-Testing-Market-Growth-Trends-2025-2031-Growing-Use-of-MRD-Testing-In-Cases-of-Solid-Tumors.html#:~:text=The%20minimal%20residual%20disease%20testing,crucial%20for%20cancer%2Daffected%20patients." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;massive and growing&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://bisresearch.com/industry-report/mrd-testing-market.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;MRD test market&lt;/a&gt; could be worth between $4.45 billion and $6.7 billion in the early 2030s, according to market estimates. That's up from $2.2 billion in 2023, according to &lt;a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/minimal-residual-disease-testing-market-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Grand View Research&lt;/a&gt;. What's driving the opportunity? A sharp increase in the number of cancer diagnoses and, in turn, survivors. By 2040, the National Cancer Institute expects there will be 26 million &lt;a href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/ocs/statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cancer survivors in the U.S&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Massive Market For Guardant Health, Rivals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer emerges from cellular mutations. MRD tests seek to find those mutations as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a patient is diagnosed with cancer, the most common route is to attack it with surgery. Guardant Health, Exact Sciences and Natera can run that sample through their systems and come up with a set of mutations — or biomarkers — consistent with that cancer, but not the patient's own DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guardant sells Reveal, while Natera has its Signatera test. Exact is angling to launch its rival, Oncodetect, in the second quarter. These blood tests screen for a small handful of cancers today. But the companies are vying to prove their merit in a growing number of cancers. Notably, fellow biotech company &lt;strong&gt;Veracyte&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VCYT" target="_blank"&gt;VCYT&lt;/a&gt;) is planning to launch an MRD test for muscle-invasive bladder cancer in the first half of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, doctors &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/guardant-health-stock-medicare-reveal-coverage-blood-test/?_gl=1*15xsk4r*_gcl_au*MTQ4MTA5NjkyOC4xNzM4MTMwMDQzLjIwMjYxODgwMzYuMTczOTU1NjU5Ny4xNzM5NTU2NTk2*_ga*NzEwMTQ4MTQuMTczODEzMDA0NA..*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0MDYwNzk1Mi42OS4xLjE3NDA2MDk0NzQuMzAuMC4w"&gt;monitor for cancer recurrence&lt;/a&gt; through a variety of imaging tests. If a patient had breast cancer, they might undergo routine mammograms. Lung cancer patients will often receive semi-regular CT scans to look for new tumors. Other patients might undergo PET scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you're in remission from your cancer, obviously the No. 1 concern that you have is your cancer is going to come back," Mike Brophy, chief financial officer of Natera, told IBD. "There's already a whole architecture of care for you to monitor that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But cancer can be unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The majority of breast cancer survivors who've had their cancer return, it's not going to return to the breast," Brophy said. "It's probably going to return to the liver or the lungs. And you're not going to catch that if you're doing radiology — an image of the breast."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Months Of Lead Time For Blood Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the cancer type, blood tests can detect a relapse an average of 15 months before imagining scans, &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/guardant-health-stock-guardant-health-earnings-q3-2024/?_gl=1*1qcdl0z*_gcl_au*MTQ4MTA5NjkyOC4xNzM4MTMwMDQzLjIwMjYxODgwMzYuMTczOTU1NjU5Ny4xNzM5NTU2NTk2*_ga*NzEwMTQ4MTQuMTczODEzMDA0NA..*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0MDYwNzk1Mi42OS4xLjE3NDA2MDk0ODEuMjMuMC4w"&gt;Guardant Health&lt;/a&gt; Chief Executive Helmy Eltoukhy told IBD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guardant's Reveal detects minimal residual disease associated with early-stage colorectal, breast and lung cancers. This group accounts for 40% of all cancer survivors, Eltoukhy estimates. Medicare pays for the cost of colon cancer monitoring. Guardant is working to receive reimbursement for breast and lung cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to data released in late 2023, Guardant Reveal has detected a breast cancer relapse up to 28.6 months before it would show up with imaging, but with a median lead time of 7.9 months. The latter time also detected a relapse with high specificity, meaning it's more likely to rule out patients who don't have cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natera's Brophy says Signatera can detect recurrent cancer around nine months before standard scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NeXT from Personalis has a six- to 11-month lead time in early-stage lung cancer and can detect breast cancer relapse a median of 15 months ahead of traditional imaging. Chen, the company's CMO, describes NeXT as an ultrasensitive test. That means it's 10 to 100 times more sensitive, analytically, than the first generation of blood tests from companies like Guardant Health and Natera, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent study called Alpha-Correct, &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/exact-sciences-stock-exact-sciences-earnings-q3-2024/?_gl=1*1qcdl0z*_gcl_au*MTQ4MTA5NjkyOC4xNzM4MTMwMDQzLjIwMjYxODgwMzYuMTczOTU1NjU5Ny4xNzM5NTU2NTk2*_ga*NzEwMTQ4MTQuMTczODEzMDA0NA..*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0MDYwNzk1Mi42OS4xLjE3NDA2MDk0ODEuMjMuMC4w"&gt;Exact Sciences&lt;/a&gt; followed colorectal cancer patients for five years. Oncodetect was able to detect cancer recurrence about 10.4 months earlier than imaging, Chief Science Officer Jorge Garces told IBD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That is critical," he said. "Weeks and months are critical in terms of being able to manage the disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Escalating Or De-Escalating?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But relapse monitoring isn't the only use for MRD testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These blood tests can also determine the success of a surgery and how to proceed from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a patient is recovering from surgery at home, companies like Guardant Health and Natera build their bespoke test. Then, after a month or so, patients get a blood draw. That blood carries the answer to the most common question for cancer patients following surgery: Did they get it all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take colorectal cancer. Roughly two-thirds of patients undergo surgery and that's it. They're cured. The remaining third have micro metastases — meaning the cancer has spread to other areas of the body. But the tumors aren't visible yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Postsurgery, both the two-thirds of people who are cured by surgery and the one-third that need to follow up with chemo, they present the same way," &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/stock-market-ibd-50-stocks-3/?_gl=1*h8k09b*_gcl_au*MTQ4MTA5NjkyOC4xNzM4MTMwMDQzLjIwMjYxODgwMzYuMTczOTU1NjU5Ny4xNzM5NTU2NTk2*_ga*NzEwMTQ4MTQuMTczODEzMDA0NA..*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0MDYwNzk1Mi42OS4xLjE3NDA2MDk1NzIuOS4wLjA."&gt;Natera&lt;/a&gt;'s Brophy said. "It's hard to tell who is who, even though doctors and patients know full well a ton of people are going to get the chemo and don't need it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a better-safe-than-sorry mentality. But these blood tests could change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natera has published data comparing patients who received chemotherapy after having their tumor surgically removed. Those who tested positive for circulating tumor DNA had a statistically significant benefit from chemo. Those who tested negative experienced no benefits from chemo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy is expensive and often causes painful side effects, Brophy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now, you have this ability to triage these patients after surgery to see who really needs chemotherapy and who doesn't," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MRD Testing Takes On Pseudo-Progression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third use case is in monitoring patients who are actively receiving treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some patients don't automatically undergo surgery. In breast cancer, for example, somewhere around half of patients first receive progressive rounds of chemotherapy in the hopes of shrinking the tumor. This will eventually allow them to receive a lumpectomy instead of a full mastectomy — removing a lump is generally preferable to removing the entire breast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to imaging, cancer often responds to aggressive treatment by appearing bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon is called pseudo-progression. The tumor isn't getting bigger because the cancer is worsening, says Personalis' Chen. It's enlarging because immune cells are going into the tumor to fight it. This is often the case when patients receive immuno-oncology drugs that help uncover camouflaged cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The blood-based tests don't have that issue," Susan Tousi, chief executive of DELFI Diagnostics, said in an interview. DELFI makes blood tests that screen people for cancer, a space closely tied to MRD testing. "I think there are some benefits that allow for earlier detection and more robust detection of treatment response."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenges Ahead For Guardant, Natera, Exact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/biotech-stocks-rhythm-pharmaceuticals-rytm-ibd-50/?_gl=1*9cw1r1*_gcl_au*MTQ4MTA5NjkyOC4xNzM4MTMwMDQzLjIwMjYxODgwMzYuMTczOTU1NjU5Ny4xNzM5NTU2NTk2*_ga*NzEwMTQ4MTQuMTczODEzMDA0NA..*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0MDYwNzk1Mi42OS4xLjE3NDA2MDk1NjMuMTguMC4w"&gt;challenges facing Guardant Health&lt;/a&gt;, Exact Sciences and Natera, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it already hasn't been easy for the trio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guardant stock had an impressive run from October to January, surging almost 105%. Since then, shares have pulled back somewhat. They're still nowhere near their record high above 181 in early 2021. But Guardant stock has climbed more than 32% this year, as of the close on Wednesday, outperforming Investor's Business Daily's Medical-Services industry group, which has risen a more moderate 2.6%. The group ranks ninth out of 197 groups IBD tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guardant Health shares rank No. 21 on the &lt;a href="https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/"&gt;IBD 50&lt;/a&gt; list of elite growth stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natera belongs to the Medical-Research Equipment/Services industry group. Veracyte ranks first, leading Natera as the second top seed. Natera shares mostly fell from late 2021 to early 2022. But shares more than quadrupled through January of this year. On a year-to-date basis, Natera shares have fallen more than 5%. The industry group, which ranks a poor No. 167, has tumbled a more precipitous 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exact Sciences stock has mostly fallen over the last few years, peaking in January 2021 above 159. Today, shares of the MRD testing company trade around 42. Exact shares dropped dramatically last November after the company missed third-quarter sales expectations and enacted an "alarming" &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/exact-sciences-stock-exact-sciences-earnings-q3-2024/?_gl=1*1jph11e*_gcl_au*MTQ4MTA5NjkyOC4xNzM4MTMwMDQzLjQzNjYyMDQxOS4xNzQwNjc3MTgxLjE3NDA2NzcxODE.*_ga*NzEwMTQ4MTQuMTczODEzMDA0NA..*_ga_K2H7B9JRSS*MTc0MTE5MzUyMS45NS4xLjE3NDExOTYzNzEuNDcuMC4w"&gt;guidance cut&lt;/a&gt;. This January, shares took a hit on competitive concerns facing its &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/exact-sciences-stock-cologuard-guardant-health-natera/"&gt;stool-based colorectal cancer test&lt;/a&gt;, Cologuard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that all three companies work in tangential testing markets. Guardant is well known for its Shield test, which uses blood to screen for colorectal cancer in asymptomatic people. Exact sells Cologuard and a multicancer early detect test called CancerGuard. Natera has numerous tests for cancer, women's health and organ health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, none of these companies are profitable — which isn't exactly a rarity for companies in the biopharma space. But it's also not preferable for savvy investors. According to FactSet, analysts don't expect Exact Sciences to notch its first profits until 2026. Natera is expected to follow in 2027. But analysts don't expect earnings, on a strict, as-reported basis, for Guardant until 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Targeting New Cancer Types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guardant Health estimates 12 million cancer survivors are more than five years out from their surgery. About 3 million of them don't have tissue samples available on which to build a personalized blood test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that reason, Natera just announced its new tissue-free MRD test. This test would scan for common mutations found in specific cancer types. So, it's not bespoke to a patient's individual cancer. The idea is to help patients who had surgery long ago, or those who can't undergo surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's less exact than Signatera, Natera's Brophy said. The tissue-free blood test catches about 86% of the cancers that Signatera finds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other challenges include tumors that don't spill as much DNA into the bloodstream. Lung cancer has been a difficult target. These tumors are known as low-shedders. There are also cancers that have fewer mutations. Personalis' Chen says this is where the ultrasensitive approach pays off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NeXT screens for up to 1,800 mutations associated with cancer, compared with first-generation blood tests which look for 16 to 50 mutations, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Eltoukhy, Guardant Health's CEO, says the technology is only getting better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"As the technology gets more sensitive, you get better at all of them," he said. "You'll get really, really good at the high-shedding ones and, then, better at the low-shedding ones. You'll still have that differential, but you'll get better at all of them over time."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Growing Market For Blood Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a huge market for blood tests to monitor for cancer relapse, says Eltoukhy. Though there are tools in place to monitor cancer survivors, it can be tricky to navigate the Byzantine health care system for which tool to use and when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are some diseases where they may scan every six months, every three months in the first year, first two years. Others where it may be annual. It's been a sort of mishmash of different available tools, whatever seems to work best for that specific cancer type," he said. "But the follow-on hasn't been, I would say, as set in stone and standardized as maybe treatment guidelines are for metastatic patients."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should take into account the newness of the technology, combined with the growing rates of cancer diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's huge and growing," Personalis' Chen said of the MRD testing market. "I think we're only scratching the surface. It's still early days for MRD. It's a new technology. People are still getting used to what it can do."&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfiam1001m3b73hsbgavyo@published"&gt;My daughters, ages 2 and 3, generally get along. They have similar interests, and both have a sense of humor. However when it comes to sharing, whether it’s me, a prized toy, or a spot at the sink to wash their hands, it often quickly turns into the 2-year-old hitting or pulling hair in an attempt to get her way. As you can imagine, this causes the 3-year-old to start screaming, then her sister starts screaming, then the 3-year-old starts crying, then they both are crying … you get the picture. The 3-year-old will hit back if I don’t get in there fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfiam1001n3b73vumldnrq@published"&gt;My question is: how do I intervene in a way that improves and supports their relationship? I always immediately pull the 2-year-old off of her sister and give the usual talk about how &lt;em&gt;hands are not for hitting and we don’t hit people&lt;/em&gt;, and of course check to make sure everyone is ok. I keep seeing parenting advice about not intervening every time your kids fight because it doesn’t give them an opportunity to learn how to problem solve. However, what do you do when almost every fight involves someone getting hurt?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfiam2001q3b73d74n5awu@published"&gt;You’re doing the right thing by intervening immediately when it comes to violence. Problem solving is one thing, but I’m not familiar with any parenting advice that suggests letting them slug it out. Personally, I stop behavior in kids if it would be considered illegal for adults to do. We’re not allowed to go around hitting people. They shouldn’t be either. That goes for verbal assault too! Of course, good luck explaining to a two-year-old that an adult would get arrested for doing what they’re doing. Still, it doesn’t hurt to mention it.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfiam2001r3b73gntkgqlz@published"&gt;My layperson-armchair-psychology take is that the two year old is hitting because they are younger and don’t feel like they have a non-violent way to assert themselves. She’s probably smaller and not as good with words yet. Work with her on other ways to assert herself without resorting to fisticuffs. The moment you intervene, ask her if she can think of another way to get what she wants without hitting. See if you can get her to explain what her intentions were. For example, “I hit because I wanted to play with the slinky.” Also try to get her sister involved in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfiam3001s3b73951rvsj5@published"&gt;Identify upcoming situations in which they’ll have to share as early as you can and prepare them for it. Before they even get to the sink, talk to them about how they’re going to use their &lt;em&gt;words&lt;/em&gt; to determine who gets to use it first and how they’re going to tell the other one when they’re finished. When there’s something big they’ll both want, you can even practice ahead of time with each of them.&lt;/p&gt;

However, we are in our early 70s now and are beginning to tire of it.  At this point, my son and daughter have seven kids between them ranging in age from eight to eighteen months. It’s no longer as easy as when it was just them and their spouses and two or three kids along with my sister and her husband and son.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfp20t002k3b73lbd9iwjq@published"&gt;When I raised the topic with my daughter, she became angry. She accused me of “cancelling Easter at the last moment and ruining things for the kids” and said she and her brother were counting on us to make Easter happen for them like we always have because our backyard is the “best and safest” choice for the egg hunt. A conversation with my son went similarly sideways and I ended up caving and agreeing to host Easter this year.  Do my husband and I have an obligation to continue this tradition until our grandkids have outgrown it?&lt;/p&gt;

Your son and daughter overreacted to the idea of not having Easter at your house.&lt;/p&gt;

If possible, try to decelerate your involvement instead. Maybe this year you just do less. Let them use the yard, but have your son and daughter do all the work. They are young! Ask them to help prepare your house ahead of time and ask them to bring all the food and drinks. You can focus on your grandkids when they’re over, and then on cleaning up the house after they leave (or you can even ask your kids to hire a cleaner to do it for you).&lt;/p&gt;

If you label yourself unable to host and generally exhausted, you might not see your grandkids as much as you’d like. And, while you might get tired from hosting a bunch of grandchildren, remember that they’ll be forming lasting memories of you. Don’t take that away from them just because their parents are being ungrateful or lazy. Put more of the burden on the parents.&lt;/p&gt;

They have a big yard with lots of great egg-hiding places. My kids are old enough now to find egg hunts a little dull and my in-laws are in their late 70s, but we still keep the tradition alive and invite friends with younger kids over too. These days my wife and I pitch in and try to do everything we can ahead of time, planning for a few weeks up to the day. We potluck it so that my in-laws don’t have to cook if they don’t want to. We help set up and help tear down. We know that it’s something the kids have done their entire lives and will remember fondly when they’re grown up.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9lfp20u002q3b73dnmlbwtx@published"&gt;From a broader perspective, your kids’ overreaction to Easter does not bode well for the future. You need to prepare them for the idea of taking care of &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; instead of the other way around. Talk to them seriously about how as you age you’ll be able to handle less and less, but that your aging doesn’t mean you don’t want to see them—just that you’ll need more help. Look at Easter as an opportunity to practice coming to a compromise that works for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For six years, Ziska and a large team of research colleagues in China and the US grew rice in controlled fields, subjecting it to varying levels of carbon dioxide and temperature. They found that when both increased, in line with projections by climate scientists, the amount of arsenic and inorganic arsenic in rice grains also went up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arsenic is found naturally in some foods, including fish and shellfish, and in waters and soils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inorganic arsenic is found in industrial materials and gets into water—including water used to submerge rice paddies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rice is easily inundated with weeds and other crops, but it has one advantage: It grows well in water. So farmers germinate the seeds, and when the seedlings are ready, plant them in wet soil. They then flood their fields, which suppresses weeds, but allows the rice to flourish. Rice readily absorbs the water and everything in it—including arsenic, either naturally occurring or not. Most of the world’s rice is grown this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new research demonstrates that climate change will ramp up those levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What happens in rice, because of complex biogeochemical processes in the soil, when temperatures and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; go up, inorganic arsenic also does,” Ziska said. “And it’s this inorganic arsenic that poses the greatest health risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposure to inorganic arsenic has been linked to cancers of the skin, bladder, and lung, heart disease, and neurological problems in infants. Research has found that in parts of the world with high consumption of rice, inorganic arsenic increases cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers analyzed data from over 1,000 people, measuring three biomarkers over a 17-year period and comparing results between those who developed dementia and those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older age was associated with higher levels of all three biomarkers, while differences were also seen between men and women and before and after menopause. These findings highlight the potential of tailoring blood-based dementia diagnostics based on individual factors like sex and hormonal status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; Older individuals had significantly higher levels of dementia-related biomarkers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex Differences:&lt;/strong&gt; Women showed higher glial protein levels; men had more neurofilament proteins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Menopause Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Pre-menopausal women had higher glial protein levels, possibly due to hormone effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study has found important clues about the roles age, sex, hormonal changes and genetics play in how certain biomarkers for dementia are expressed in the blood, according to a study published on April 16, 2025, online in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Blood tests that detect biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias are emerging and as these tests are further developed, they are becoming important tools for understanding and diagnosing these conditions,” said study author Hannah Stocker, PhD, MPH, of Heidelberg University in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108847"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and the outline of a person." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/blood-biomarkers-genetics-age-neurosceince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Researchers also found that female participants had higher levels of glial acidic proteins, while male participants had higher levels of neurofilament light chain proteins. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings provide valuable insights into how age, sex, genetics and hormonal changes during menopause are linked to three biomarkers believed to influence a person’s risk of dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from a larger 17-year study, comparing 513 people who developed dementia during the study to 513 people who remained free of dementia during that time. The participants had an average age of 64 at the start of the study.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers took blood samples from participants three times during the study to measure levels of three biomarkers: neurofilament light chain proteins, glial acidic proteins and phosphorylated tau 181.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurofilament light chain proteins are found in the blood when nerve cells are injured or die. Glial acidic proteins are released when cells work to repair injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phosphorylated tau 181 is linked to the buildup of amyloid proteins in the body, which occurs in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers then compared levels of the biomarkers in people with and without dementia in the following ways: over time as people aged; in male and female participants; in people with and without a gene linked to Alzheimer’s; and in female participants before and after menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, sex, and APOEe4, a genetic biomarker that indicates a strong risk of Alzheimer’s disease, researchers found that an older age was tied to higher levels of all three markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For neurofilament light chain proteins, people age 75 had an average of 25 picograms per milliliter (pg/ml) compared to people age 50 with an average of 10 pg/ml. For glial acidic proteins, people age 75 had an average of 140 pg/ml compared to people age 50 with an average of 45 pg/ml.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For phosphorylated tau 181, people age 75 had an average of two to three pg/ml compared to people age 50 with an average of 0.5 to 1.5 pg/ml.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found that female participants had higher levels of glial acidic proteins, while male participants had higher levels of neurofilament light chain proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, they found people who had the APOEe4 gene had higher levels of tau and glial acidic proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the study found that female participants who had not yet gone through menopause had higher levels of glial acidic proteins, which Stocker noted may be due to having higher levels of sex hormones. Stocker said previous studies have found a link between sex hormones and neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gaining a better understanding of these biomarkers will help improve our ability to test for dementia in the future with simple blood tests,” said Stocker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research underscores the need to further explore these biomarkers, including during menopause, in the development of dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study was that participants were of European descent, so the results may not be the same for other populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by the German Alzheimer Forschung Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#026c616d6c7063664263636c2c616d6f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Natalie Conrad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Natalie Conrad – AAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 13:30:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE5Vb3pCLWpFd2FvOEhFRUJuRk9XcVFpZEROYlM0amVQNmc1OFN5aHNkUzhLZ1RWMHl2aExrRWNqVjlFM0k5Zk9SQU5YYzI2TFFQaHRJZHB2SmdIc1hwcEhVcHZBQnIyYWY0d0xZRWhOQ3BGUVJrMFg5dUd3</guid></item><item><title>大豆是否应该被禁止进入美国自助餐厅？法国食品安全局的回应敲响了风险的警钟和警告！ -银河日报 | Should Soybeans Be Banned from American Cafeterias?

&lt;p&gt;France’s national food safety authority has issued a stark recommendation that could impact menus across the country’s &lt;strong&gt;public institutions&lt;/strong&gt;. The Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l’alimentation, de l’environnement et du travail&lt;strong&gt; (Anses)&lt;/strong&gt; has raised concerns over the risks of excessive soy consumption, particularly in the context of mass catering services like &lt;strong&gt;school cafeterias&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;hospitals&lt;/strong&gt;, and nursing homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why Soy Is Under Renewed Scrutiny&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soy-based products&lt;/strong&gt; like soy&lt;em&gt; milk&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; tofu&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;miso&lt;/em&gt; have become increasingly visible in Western diets. Long a staple in Asian cuisine, soy is especially popular among vegetarian and vegan consumers due to its high content of &lt;strong&gt;plant-based proteins&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But despite its popularity, soy is a controversial food. Its composition includes phytoestrogens, specifically &lt;strong&gt;isoflavones&lt;/strong&gt;, which are naturally occurring compounds known to have estrogen-like hormonal activity. According to Anses, high levels of isoflavones can have &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/nasas-worst-fear-martian-dust-is-way-deadlier-than-you-think/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="85206" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;toxic effects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on the reproductive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The agency has now formally recommended that soy products no longer be served in public catering facilities, regardless of age group. This measure, Anses states in its &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.anses.fr/fr/content/eviter-les-isoflavones-dans-les-menus-des-restaurations-collectives" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;March 24, 2025 publication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, aims to avoid overconsumption of foods rich in isoflavones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who Would Be Affected by the Guidance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The recommendation would apply to a wide range of institutions. The list includes&lt;em&gt; day-care centers, preschools, primary and secondary schools,&lt;/em&gt; colleges, universities, hospitals, nursing homes, vacation centers, and &lt;strong&gt;prisons&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts cited in the report highlight that high soy intake may extend the length of &lt;strong&gt;menstrual cycles&lt;/strong&gt; in women and reduce testosterone levels in men, with potential negative effects on &lt;strong&gt;fertility&lt;/strong&gt;. In children, the concern is focused on the possibility of hormonal disruption during development due to prolonged exposure to isoflavones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Anses points out that isoflavones, although naturally found in many plants, are especially concentrated in soy—which remains the primary known source of these compounds in the human diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Soy Already Has Limited Use in Collective Catering&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the gravity of Anses’ warning, soy is not currently a major player in collective catering. The publication &lt;strong&gt;60 Millions de Consommateurs&lt;/strong&gt; recently reported that the Syndicat national de la restauration collective has responded to Anses, stating that crèches no longer use soy-based products.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In school cafeterias, soy is already used in a very limited capacity. It is only included as part of the &lt;strong&gt;vegetarian menu experiment&lt;/strong&gt; outlined by the Conseil national de la restauration collective, which allows one soy-based meal for every five vegetarian meals served.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This limited frequency already reflects an effort to manage soy intake across age groups, but Anses is now recommending more decisive action to ensure population-wide protection from &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/11/5-signs-youre-eating-too-much-sugar/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="71991" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hormonal risks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to Reduce Soy Exposure Without Cutting Plant Proteins&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anses emphasizes that it is entirely possible to reduce exposure to isoflavones while maintaining a &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/08/diet-changes-reduce-heart-kidney-disease/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="7330" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthy, plant-rich diet&lt;/a&gt;. One strategy is to diversify plant protein sources—for example, by replacing soy with &lt;strong&gt;legumes&lt;/strong&gt; such as lentils or beans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency also notes the importance of distinguishing between different soy-based products, as isoflavone levels vary widely. Some soy snacks, like &lt;strong&gt;soy-based crackers&lt;/strong&gt;, can contain 100 times more isoflavones than other products like soy sauce, which is typically fermented and used in small quantities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These insights suggest that consumers and institutions alike can reduce risk not only by lowering overall soy intake, but also by choosing products more carefully.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When activated by patterned infrared light, these nanoparticles stimulate retinal cells, bypassing damaged photoreceptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This activation leads to visual signal transmission to the brain, confirmed by activity in the visual cortex. Researchers envision a future device combining these nanoparticles with laser-equipped goggles to restore functional vision in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; Gold nanoparticles stimulate bipolar and ganglion cells using infrared light.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Invasive Approach:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike electrode implants, nanoparticle delivery uses simple eye injections.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restored Visual Signals:&lt;/strong&gt; Brain imaging confirmed visual cortex activation post-treatment in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Brown University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study by Brown University researchers suggests that gold nanoparticles — microscopic bits of gold thousands of times thinner than a human hair — might one day be used to help restore vision in people with macular degeneration and other retinal disorders. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/em&gt; and supported by the National Institutes of Health, the research team showed that nanoparticles injected into the retina can successfully stimulate the visual system and restore vision in mice with retinal disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108839"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an eye." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/gold-nanoparticles-and-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Retinal disorders like macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa affect millions of people in the U.S. and around the world. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that a new type of visual prosthesis system in which nanoparticles, used in combination with a small laser device worn in a pair of glasses or goggles, might one day help people with retinal disorders to see again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a new type of retinal prosthesis that has the potential to restore vision lost to retinal degeneration without requiring any kind of complicated surgery or genetic modification,” said Jiarui Nie, a postdoctoral researcher at the National Institutes of Health who led the research while completing her Ph.D. at Brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe this technique could potentially transform treatment paradigms for retinal degenerative conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nie performed the work while working in the lab of Jonghwan Lee, an associate professor in Brown’s School of Engineering and a faculty affiliate at Brown’s Carney Institute for Brain Science, who oversaw the work and served as the study’s senior author. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retinal disorders like macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa affect millions of people in the U.S. and around the world. These conditions damage light-sensitive cells in the retina called photoreceptors — the “rods” and “cones” that convert light into tiny electric pulses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those pulses stimulate other types of cells further up the visual chain called bipolar and ganglion cells, which process the photoreceptor signals and send them along to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new approach uses nanoparticles injected directly into the retina to bypass damaged photoreceptors. When infrared light is focused on the nanoparticles, they generate a tiny amount of heat that activates bipolar and ganglion cells in much the same way that photoreceptor pulses do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because disorders like macular degeneration affect mostly photoreceptors while leaving bipolar and ganglion cells intact, the strategy has the potential to restore lost vision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new study, the research team tested the nanoparticle approach in mouse retinas and in living mice with retinal disorders. After injecting a liquid nanoparticle solution, the researchers used patterned near-infrared laser light to project shapes onto the retinas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a calcium signal to detect cellular activity, the team confirmed that the nanoparticles were exciting bipolar and ganglion cells in patterns matched the shapes projected by the laser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiments showed that neither the nanoparticle solution nor the laser stimulation caused detectable adverse side effects, as indicated by metabolic markers for inflammation and toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using probes, the researchers confirmed that laser stimulation of the nanoparticles caused increased activity in the visual cortices of the mice — an indication that previously absent visual signals were being transmitted and processed by the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, the researchers say, is a sign that vision had been at least partially restored, a good sign for potentially translating a similar technology to humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For human use, the researchers envision a system that combines the nanoparticles with a laser system mounted in a pair of glasses or goggles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameras in the goggles would gather image data from the outside world and use it to drive the patterning of an infrared laser. The laser pulses would then stimulate the nanoparticles in people’s retinas, enabling them to see. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach is similar to one that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for human use a few years ago. The older approach combined a camera system with a small electrode array that was surgically implanted in the eye. The nanoparticle approach has several key advantages, according to Nie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, it’s far less invasive. As opposed to surgery, “an intravitreal injection is one of the simplest procedures in ophthalmology,” Nie said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are functional advantages as well. The resolution of the previous approach was limited by the size of the electrode array — about 60 square pixels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the nanoparticle solution covers the whole retina, the new approach could potentially cover someone’s full field of vision. And because the nanoparticles respond to near-infrared light as opposed to visual light, the system doesn’t necessarily interfere with any residual vision a person may retain.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More work needs to be done before the approach can be tried in a clinical setting, Nie said, but this early research suggests that it’s possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We showed that the nanoparticles can stay in the retina for months with no major toxicity,” Nie said of the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And we showed that they can successfully stimulate the visual system. That’s very encouraging for future applications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health’s National Eye Institute (R01EY030569), the China Scholarship Council scholarship, the Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission scholarship, and South Korea’s Alchemist Project Program (RS-2024-00422269). Co-authors also include Professor Kyungsik Eom from Pusan National University, Brown Professor Tao Lui, as well as Brown students Hafithe M.

Lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic are all carcinogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Rubin first learned that lead was added to toothpaste about 12 years ago while working with families that had children with high levels of the metal in their blood. The common denominator among them was a brand of toothpaste, Earthpaste, that contained lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Last year she detected high levels in some toothpaste using an XRF lead detection tool. The levels were high enough to raise concern, and she crowdfunded with readers to send popular brands to an independent laboratory for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Among those found to contain the toxins were Crest, Sensodyne, Tom’s of Maine, Dr Bronner’s, Davids, Dr Jen and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;So far, none of the companies Lead Safe Mama checked have said they will work to get lead out of their product, Rubin said. Several sent her cease-and-desist letters, which she said she ignored, but also &lt;a href="https://tamararubin.com/2025/02/just-ingredients-sends-lead-safe-mama-llc-a-cease-desist-letter-february-2025-read-the-full-letter-here-please-comment-with-your-reaction-below/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on her blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some companies have &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/leadsafemama/p/DGAjitsOemW/?img_index=1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;defended themselves&lt;/a&gt;, often &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/leadsafemama/p/DFb9gnEOD2P/?img_index=1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;claiming&lt;/a&gt; that lead &lt;a href="https://wellnesse.com/pages/wellnesse-toothpaste-rebuttal?srsltid=AfmBOopmOTTRa-FH1kxDxHwiCuLqulrWwyXbXUF0uK7bSxIdDZb4aPOz" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;is found&lt;/a&gt; in trace levels throughout the environment and is impossible to avoid. Others &lt;a href="https://tamararubin.com/2025/02/responses-from-toothpaste-companies/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;have said&lt;/a&gt; the levels Rubin found are not concerning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The federal Baby Food Safety Act of 2024, which is stalled in Congress, called for lead limits in kids’ food or personal care products like toothpaste of five parts per billion (ppb). California’s limit on lead in baby food is two ppb, but it does not include toothpaste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Most toothpastes exceeded those thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The FDA’s current lead limit for children is 10,000 ppb, and 20,000 ppb for adults. None exceeded the FDA limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The state of Washington recently enacted a law with 1,000 ppb limits – several exceeded that and have been reported, Rubin said, but companies have time to get in compliance with the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Crest’s parent company, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Rubin said the contamination seems to lie in some ingredients added to toothpaste, including hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate and bentonite clay. Hydroxyapatite is extracted from cow bone and added because it allegedly helps teeth absorb calcium, though Rubin said she doubts it does. Calcium carbonate is added to help remove stains from teeth. Bentonite clay is a cleaning agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Those with the highest levels all had bentonite clay. Meanwhile, Rubin’s testing of hydroxyapatite and calcium carbonate as individual ingredients showed concerning levels of lead and other metals, suggesting those are the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Several children’s toothpastes, like Dr Brown’s Baby Toothpaste, did not test positive for any metals and did not contain the ingredients in question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPSmdaSnZOTFY0UTFpZG8zQ2VvblRaNTRGczM3T1Z2QkNBZkk1OEdBUnFZemhhTndua1N1cldqVWJsXzdvTGU4enFnTG8zaW5TbmZvVEYzUHpuNVhpeTF6Tmw2bkl4X2ZnVWo4M3prSkk0cERBeDY0M183OHBDX3BRbjdR</guid></item><item><title>“瓶中运动”药物帮助身体燃烧更多脂肪，更有效地利用能量-新闻的光明面 | ‘Exercise in a bottle’ drug helps the body burn more fat, use energy more efficiently - The Brighter Side of News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPbXBZUXAtU3ZCWk1IMWRPRTRNVHBTOGt2X0VYanE1Y0lhaWQ1ZHRnWERDMmlIVG5Zd2NRNGxtQkgwbl9xTU9XWDJIQkJnV1dZbmt6M3A5V2cxOFFUdUVQRkpVRXp2eTJhdHJBdF9xenpENjhZOUltcmQ2XzZ0SFVkYnpBNXJESkQ4TDRzbURiWXdlSEhPX1kxN3lXaEI5Y0xLVXNsX2ltLUtXM3NCVGNubjViOU1MMHZDQW1kV1NiZTk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root css-a9h2n1" data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks"&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new drug may one day help fight obesity and related diseases by mimicking the benefits of aerobic exercise—without the need to move a muscle. Scientists at &lt;a href="https://medicine.wustl.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Washington University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; have developed a compound called SLU-PP-332 that shows strong promise in helping the body burn more fat, use energy more efficiently, and reduce insulin resistance, especially in conditions like metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no pill can replace the full value of physical activity, new research suggests that certain molecules can copy key changes exercise brings about inside your muscles. These discoveries may open the door to powerful new treatments for people who can’t exercise because of age, injury, or chronic illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_molecule_that_works_like_aerobic_exercise"&gt;A molecule that works like aerobic exercise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLU-PP-332 is a lab-made compound that activates a group of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-proteins-repair-heart-muscle-and-regenerate-organs/"&gt;proteins&lt;/a&gt; called estrogen-related receptors, or ERRs. These proteins help control how your body uses energy during physical activity. They’re most active in high-energy organs like the heart, liver, and skeletal muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;SLU-PP-332 improves muscle function and increases fatty acid metabolism in vivo. (CREDIT: ScienceDirect) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes SLU-PP-332 special is that it activates all three types of ERRs—α, β, and γ—which together help boost the body's energy use, fat burning, and muscle endurance. In studies using mice, this drug increased the type of muscle fibers that are most resistant to fatigue. That means animals on the drug could exercise longer without getting tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the benefits weren’t limited to performance. Mice given SLU-PP-332 showed &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-identify-a-new-way-to-combat-fatty-liver-disease/"&gt;lower fat buildup&lt;/a&gt;, better use of fatty acids for energy, and improved blood sugar control. These changes are hallmarks of what the body normally experiences after weeks or months of regular aerobic exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_science_of_how_it_works"&gt;The science of how it works&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why SLU-PP-332 works so well, it helps to know how skeletal muscle uses energy. Depending on the situation, your muscles can switch between using sugar (glucose) and fat (fatty acids) as fuel. Short bursts of activity rely on sugar, while long, low-intensity movement tends to use fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise shifts this balance. The longer you move, the more your muscles rely on fat. This switch also encourages your cells to build more mitochondria—the tiny engines that convert food into energy. More mitochondria mean more endurance, better sugar use, and less fat storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLU-PP-332 triggers many of the same pathways. It boosts fat use in muscles, helps them become more efficient, and supports overall metabolic health. These effects are especially important in diseases like obesity and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/zinc-levels-linked-to-type-2-diabetes-risk-study-finds/"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, which involve poor fat breakdown and reduced muscle energy capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice fed a high-fat diet and then treated with SLU-PP-332 showed less weight gain, improved energy use while resting, and better results on glucose tolerance tests. That means their bodies processed sugar more like healthy, fit animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ERRs belong to the same family as estrogen receptors but don't bind to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/egg-and-soybean-consumption-linked-to-aggressive-type-of-cancer/"&gt;estrogen&lt;/a&gt; itself. Instead, they’re active all the time and are key players in how cells manage energy. They help control genes involved in fat burning, mitochondrial growth, and cellular respiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, scientists have tested mice with changes in ERR function. Mice missing ERRβ die before birth. Those without ERRα or ERRγ develop problems like heart failure. On the flip side, mice that overexpress ERRγ in their muscles grow more oxidative muscle fibers and can exercise for longer periods. This makes ERRs attractive drug targets for diseases that involve energy failure, like obesity and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/pecans-found-to-improve-cholesterol-diet-quality-and-lower-heart-disease-risk/"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have long suspected that activating these receptors with drugs could mimic some of the changes brought on by aerobic exercise. SLU-PP-332 was built to test that idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In earlier tests, it showed up in both blood and muscle tissue at levels high enough to cause these effects. Even six hours after being injected into mice, the drug was still found at measurable concentrations in muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="beyond_weight_loss_future_medical_potential"&gt;Beyond weight loss: Future medical potential&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bahaa Elgendy, a professor of anesthesiology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, leads the research. Elgendy shared that the goal isn’t to replace exercise. “We cannot replace exercise; exercise is important on all levels… But there are so many cases in which a substitute is needed,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with muscle wasting due to aging, cancer, or &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-ai-based-system-significantly-reduces-ivf-related-miscarriages-genetic-disorders/"&gt;genetic disorders&lt;/a&gt;, exercise might not be possible. That’s where a drug like SLU-PP-332 could be a game-changer. By simulating the metabolic changes triggered by physical activity, it may help maintain strength and health in people who can't stay active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newer versions of SLU-PP-332 have also been developed. These next-gen compounds bind more strongly to ERRs and lead to even greater changes in gene activity. In lab tests, they outperformed the original version of the drug, suggesting that even more powerful exercise mimetics could be just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;SLU-PP-332 does not improve glucose metabolism in vivo in chow-fed mice.

For example, other studies have shown that ERRα activation helps improve fatty liver disease in mice. There's even evidence that ERRs play a role in fighting cognitive decline. Although SLU-PP-332 doesn’t cross into the brain, other ERR-activating drugs might be able to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/ketones-can-improve-brain-function-and-protect-against-diabetes-and-alzheimers/"&gt;protect neurons&lt;/a&gt; and slow conditions like Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="building_toward_the_next_phase"&gt;Building toward the next phase&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is still in its early stages, but the team has big plans. Elgendy and colleagues, in partnership with a biotech startup called Pelagos Pharmaceuticals, are preparing to test new compounds in animals with various diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They want to explore how these drugs affect aging-related decline, &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-mri-scan-can-identify-patients-at-risk-for-serious-heart-problems/"&gt;heart problems&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly brain health. If successful, this could change how medicine treats conditions tied to metabolism and inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;SLU-PP-332 increases fatty acid metabolism in a DIO mouse model.

Two awards—R21AG065657 and RF1AG077160—supported the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="21" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The science behind SLU-PP-332 shows how deep our understanding of the body’s energy systems has become. Instead of simply &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/surprising-study-finds-inverse-relationship-between-exercise-and-daily-activity/"&gt;burning calories&lt;/a&gt;, exercise shapes how your cells work, what fuels they prefer, and how strong your tissues can be. Drugs that copy these effects could give new hope to those who need help most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="22" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if a magic fitness pill isn't ready for the market yet, scientists are getting closer to building one.

Some farms use unregulated water sources to irrigate the fields. “Some farms use untreated or minimally treated surface water from rivers, lakes or canals, increasing the risk of contamination,” Detwiler said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When it’s time to harvest, there are added risks for pathogens and bacteria to come in contact with lettuce. “Contamination can occur through human handling, contaminated equipment or water used in post-harvest processes to transport, produce or remove soil,” Baker said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the processing plant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are opportunities for pathogens to come in contact with leafy greens once they reach a processing plant. The greens you get in a bag don’t typically come from one field but from multiple farms, complicating traceability and increasing contamination. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greens are processed in a centralized area and distributed — which is convenient for all the companies involved in the process— but not ideal from a food safety standpoint. “Greens from different farms are mixed, washed and packaged together, so one contaminated leaf can impact thousands of bags across multiple states,” Detwiler explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lettuce is washed in large vats, added &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://drexel.edu/cnhp/faculty/profiles/TroutRosemary/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Rosemary Trout," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67f827bee4b0c6da0011396b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://drexel.edu/cnhp/faculty/profiles/TroutRosemary/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rosemary Trout,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; associate professor and program director of Culinary Arts &amp;amp; Food Science at Drexel University. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;What you may not suspect, according to Trout, is that “plant foods are usually more often associated with foodborne illness than animal products.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the journey to store shelves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keeping the greens cold is necessary to prevent any pathogens from growing and spreading. According to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roszkowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, “Not keeping the greens consistently cold throughout the process of harvesting, processing and transporting can cause bacterial growth to occur.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, refrigeration doesn’t eliminate the chance of pathogens; it can help slow them down. “Refrigeration slows bacterial growth but does not kill bacteria, meaning contaminated greens can still cause illness, even if stored properly,” Detwiler said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will washing prewashed salad greens help?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re thinking, “W&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ell, I’ll wash my prewashed greens for extra safety measures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;,” don’t. Washing greens at home doesn’t make them safer because water won’t remove the pathogens, Detwiler said. Rinsing prewashed greens can introduce pathogens that may be lurking on your counter or sink. “Prewashed greens should not be rewashed at home, as doing so can introduce contamination if the sink, utensils, equipment or hands of the preparer are not properly cleaned or sanitized,” Baker said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Westend61 via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Westend61 via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Washing greens can remove pesticides, but it's not been proven to be effective in removing pathogens.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bacteria or pathogens aren’t obvious and can’t be seen. “If greens are contaminated with pathogens, they cannot be detected by sight, smell or taste … and can’t be removed by washing,” Baker explained. According to Detwiler, “Bacteria like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;E. coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;salmonella&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; can form biofilms that help them stick to the surface of the leaves [and] once attached, these bacteria do not simply rinse off.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Harmful pathogens need to be cooked to be eliminated, as heat kills them, said Detwiler. A big issue with lettuce is it’s usually eaten raw, not cooked, “making it challenging to reduce the risk of foodborne illness,” Baker said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations for buying bagged greens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you still prefer buying bagged greens for the convenience, there are several precautions to take. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check for recalls &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before you purchase any salad greens, check if there are any recalls, advised &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Detwiler and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roszkowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “Stay updated on recalls via the FDA and CDC websites,” Detwiler said. “If your greens are part of an outbreak, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;throw them away immediately.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check expiration dates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts say you should look at the expiration dates before purchasing. Trout advises to only buy what you will eat within a day or two. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for freshness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Avoid bags with excess moisture that look wet, as damp environments are a haven for bacteria to thrive, Detwiler said. “Inspect the package to ensure the lettuce looks fresh, without wilting or discoloration, as these signs may indicate improper storage or reduced freshness,” Baker said. You also want to stay away from any bags that have slimy leaves, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roszkowski added&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimize temperature changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once you’ve purchased greens, don’t let them sit in a hot car or garage or out on the counter. “Avoid drastic changes in temperature when transporting them from the store and when preparing a meal,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roszkowski said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “This leads to condensation and creates a moist and warm environment that can encourage both spoilage and bacterial growth.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ice.edu/about/faculty-profiles/olivia-roszkowski" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67f827bee4b0c6da0011396b" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ice.edu/about/faculty-profiles/olivia-roszkowski" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Store properly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Greens should be kept refrigerated at or below 40 degrees Fahrenheit, say Detwiler and Trout. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy heads of lettuce &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Purchasing a head of lettuce or a bunch of spinach may have the extra step of rinsing and drying before tossing in a salad bowl or stir-frying, but you could be minimizing the risk of lurking pathogens. “Whole heads of lettuce or spinach have less surface area for contamination compared to pre-cut, mixed bagged greens,” Detwiler said. He suggests rinsing them under cold water — not soaking — to remove dirt, debris, any insects and surface-level bacteria. “Wash them at home before eating.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 11:00:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxPTUxNR2pyc1BSVjNyTjhmTUtiY01XdG16d3UxSUVMMjlDVWdqMmR6WE53dV9CVXBnXzBzN09SZWNpX19sTnE2dmU3OHd5RXZILWJfaFVKVFQ3QkpJTlRyR1pueU1rdTlZZzlDaWNpYVpBT0RoZW80SmlGTjU3UXpxR3ByalB4WnhZbnAzVV9YYjNWdUXSAZgBQVVfeXFMTTdRamdQMDFPLXl3Rkd3ZGxybGZ6TUpvZDhnUVJVSmFTNGFJMlA5ZXotSUNsTVVwblc4elp6Y05fcTk5NGUwejJETUpQcE0wUFlpNFdQQXlpWDdWSklaWmRjZFczdmM2SllvbEdrcVVCWjFlV1Mxam1TQjBacTN1czJQSUZqTFJOaVdTSTBqU0EzcTgxYjZYUVg</guid></item><item><title>我的朋友一直在我们的孩子面前做一件非常可怕的事情。我需要这个来停止。-石板 | My Friend Keeps Doing a Really Awful Thing in Front of Our Kids.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="207" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kje9cn0024357592lvbvu8@published"&gt;I know the general rule is don’t comment on other people’s parenting and don’t give unsolicited parenting advice. But! Can you ask a parent to change the way they behave in front of you and your kid? I have some friends, “Elo” and “Raven,” whose 3-year-old, “Jax,” is one of my 3-year-old’s best friends. Elo and Raven divorced when Jax was about 1 ½—thank god, because the tension was through the roof when we all hung out. I love hanging out with Elo and Jax, but I really struggle when I spend time with Raven. Jax has autism and some developmental delays, but in many ways they also behave like any other 3-year-old. Jax is verbal, responds to questions and redirection, and is constantly learning and changing. Every time I see them, I can tell they’ve made leaps in their development, even if their speech and reactions are not the same as a neurotypical 3-year-old. But Raven is always making comments in front of Jax and my child about how Jax “doesn’t understand anything that goes on around them,” and constantly compares our kids: “oh, it’s so nice that your kid takes turns/is calm/knows their name; Jax doesn’t know how to do that and probably never will.”&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="140" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kje9g200253575tagb29nf@published"&gt;It’s painful to witness, because it’s so clear that Jax understands everything, even if their responses are not exactly the same as my kid’s. I’m sure it’s self-preservation from having a child with more challenges than Raven expected, but Jax is a smart, sweet kid and Raven needs to see that! I don’t want my child to hear Raven comparing them with Jax. I don’t think it’s appropriate, and I want them to stop doing it. I also want them to stop telling me Jax doesn’t understand anything. Can I ask for these boundaries to be in place when my child and I are present? I’m thinking about writing Raven a letter, because they generally don’t respond well to feedback. It doesn’t feel appropriate to involve Elo even though Elo is also Jax’s parent, because Elo and Raven are divorced.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="159" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kje9oo002a3575nvi521t1@published"&gt;This would bum me out, too. As the fellow parent of an autistic child, the most generous (possibly too generous?) interpretation I can muster is that Raven may be in pretty ableist medical and/or educational environments that encourage them to do exactly what they’re doing: compare their kid to others, and pay more attention to deficits than strengths. Of course, Raven is allowed to have feelings about Jax’s autism or the support they need. And sure, at least some of Raven’s comments are probably the result of processing those thoughts and feelings aloud, with someone they assume will be somewhat sympathetic (you).&lt;br&gt;But there’s what you feel, and then there’s what you do with those feelings. Raven is making whatever problems she’s having Jax’s problems, too (and yours!). It just isn’t appropriate to vent your fears or frustrations about your disabled 3-year-old in front of said 3-year-old—sorry, but you’ve gotta pick a different time, a different place, a different way.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="180" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kje9sh002b3575febf7hp5@published"&gt;When encountering ableist parents (and it’s always sadder but unsurprising to me when they have disabled kids themselves), I usually go with one of two options. The easy one is distance: If the relationship isn’t super important to me, I might just let it go, because my time is finite and I don’t need to expose myself or my kid to any more ableism than we already encounter. The other option is (somewhat grudging) education—I don’t mean that I try to engage them in Disability 101 or whatever, but I’ll correct false assertions or push back when needed. I might go so far as to explain why something they said about autism is wrong, or perhaps cite a source like the &lt;a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/"&gt;Autistic Self-Advocacy Network&lt;/a&gt;. I have also had to ask some parents to talk to their own kids about ableism, after those kids said or did something harmful to my kid. Sometimes, though, these things lead us back to distance—either because the other parent/family’s ableism is a dealbreaker for me, or because the other parent just finds me super annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kje9ui002c3575p94kslvp@published"&gt;This is all to say that if you don’t want to hear ableist stuff from a fellow parent, and you don’t want your kid hearing it, either—or taking your silence for agreement—I think it’s OK for you to say something. And I don’t even really think it is about Jax’s parenting; it’s more about how &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; want to parent your own child. You seem to want them to appreciate and enjoy all kinds of people. You don’t want them to grow up ableist. You don’t want them to think worse of Jax or other kids like them—you want them to respect and see whatever is good in every kid they meet, and not assume that autistic or disabled kids can’t be smart or fun or wonderful friends.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="170" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kje9xh002d35750dcsog6f@published"&gt;You can think about whether you really want to try to let Raven know about those things you want for your kid, and how—in a letter; in person; parent to parent; etc. But as you probably already know, it might not lead to the outcome you want. Raven might not be in a place where they can hear what you’re saying, or view their situation differently. They might also get mad at you, no matter how kind or careful you try to be. And in the end, they’re going to parent how they choose to parent, and they and Jax will bear the consequences. If they keep making their ableist remarks and it turns out to be a dealbreaker for you, then you may need to decide whether your kid mostly sees Jax during Elo’s time rather than Raven’s. You don’t have the power to change Raven, but you do get to choose what &lt;em&gt;you’re&lt;/em&gt; willing to put up with, and what you want your child to hear and absorb.&lt;/p&gt;

It was obviously devastating. My heart is broken for her. I live on the other side of the country, so I haven’t been able to be as present as I would like. I’m planning a trip over the summer to her coast and I definitely want to see her, but I’m struggling with how to plan the trip without overburdening her and her husband. Normally, I would just ask to stay with them for a few days, but I don’t know if they would want a house guest. But I also think she might be upset if I say I’m staying at an Airbnb in their town. They live pretty far away from other friends I could stay with, but it wouldn’t be impossible to meet for lunch somewhere in the middle. How can I plan this trip to maximize support but minimize stress for them? I just want to give her a hug and make them a meal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kjeah3002j3575xgk0k4ee@published"&gt;It’s kind of you to want to offer in-person support to your friend, assuming she is open to it. I understand why you might prefer not to ask, but in this case, I think there’s no avoiding it—not if you actually want to ascertain and respect her wishes. Unless you talk about it with her, you’re reduced to guessing.&lt;/p&gt;

And I think you can try to bring up the possibility of a visit in a way that puts the least amount of pressure on her. First, let her know that you’re planning to be in the area, and you’d love to see her if she has time. And then just make it clear that you’d be open to doing so in whatever way would be best for her, perhaps something like: “Of course I’d be glad to stay with you, but I’m also very happy to stay somewhere else if that’s easier. I can come over and make a meal, or we can meet for lunch if you’d prefer. Think about it and let me know—I hope to see and catch up, and also have this visit be as easy as possible for you.”&lt;/p&gt;

Then your friend will know all the options and have time to think it over; she won’t feel the pressure of needing to answer right away.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="130" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9kjeayx002o35752zv6ibad@published"&gt;My 2-year-old is on a pretty hardcore napping strike right now, after being a reliable two-hour napper for many months. The switch was sudden despite no major life changes. She is my fourth child, so I know a lot of the recommendations already (keep naptime consistent, darken the room, remove distractions) and follow them—I just have not had a child do this before. I have a childproof lock over the doorknob and she will stay in her room for over an hour for “rest,” but she rarely sleeps. I plan to keep enforcing “rest time” and hope she goes back to napping eventually, but in the meantime, do you know anyone who has had a similar experience and lived to tell the tale? Did their kid go back to napping?&lt;/p&gt;

My younger child was never a great napper, and gave it up somewhere between 2 and 2 ½. We referred to that last hour or so before her 7pm bedtime as witching hour, because, well, none of us were at our best. In our case, once the nap was gone, it never came back. But of course it’s possible that your child is just on a nap strike, and will eventually go back to sleeping during the day.&lt;/p&gt;

Even if your 2-year-old doesn’t fall asleep, the chill quiet time is probably good for her (and for you). It can also flow nicely into her having chunks of increasingly independent time, when she doesn’t expect you or anyone else to entertain her.&lt;/p&gt;

She helps with school drop-off and pickup, does a few hours of child care on the weekend, and is always ready to randomly babysit whenever we need. The 10 percent: Whenever he goes down to visit her, he gets banana bread, trail mix with M&amp;amp;Ms, lemonade (not cut with water or seltzer), and other things we would consider “sometimes” foods.

         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9ketyms001f2cqj3bcvda58@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles cases have surpassed 650 in an ongoing multistate outbreak, but federal funding cuts could threaten the response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol00023b5vi593glth@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that we are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions,” Dr. David Sugerman, a senior scientist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Tuesday at a meeting of the agency’s vaccine advisers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol00033b5vcdn5zhup@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Texas – the epicenter of the outbreak – has sent several requests to the CDC for resources, Sugerman said, as response costs grow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol00053b5v82ynze77@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC recently pulled back billions of dollars in Covid-19 pandemic-era grants that state and local health officials said were also being used to respond to other public health threats, like the measles outbreak. The US Department of Health and Human Services also announced sweeping layoffs two weeks ago, including an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/health/hhs-rfk-job-cuts/index.html"&gt;2,400&lt;/a&gt; employees from the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol00063b5v8nlbnnmv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In light of these cuts, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/07/health/measles-outbreak-texas-response-challenges/index.html"&gt;Dallas County&lt;/a&gt;, Texas, says it has had to cancel over 50 immunization clinics. In New Mexico – where at least 63 measles cases have been reported – some staff that was responsible for order vaccines and checking vaccination records had to be let go.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol00043b5vjaswvobe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The outbreak is spreading within Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma, and Sugerman said the same genotyping sequence of the virus has been found in cases in Kansas and across international borders in Ontario, Canada, and Chihuahua, Mexico.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol00083b5vhxl5hy2n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Texas is mobilizing its resources and moving staff from other areas and domains into the measles response area, Sugerman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol00093b5v32hmrh2i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But local officials say resource limitations are taking a toll on public health workers and the health system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000a3b5vi9arw0ez@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We still have to be able to do all of our other public health work, so it does become a strain on the system,” said Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health. “Public health doesn’t have … a lot of duplication of staff, so … you’re asking a lot of staff to do additional work beyond their regular daily jobs. It just gets draining.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000b3b5v89ck4lja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say that the effects of these funding cuts will be felt beyond the measles outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000c3b5vn6udkss1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Other types of care are going to be influenced by having to redirect these resources to the setting,” said Dr. Bryan Patenaude, an associate professor of health economics at Johns Hopkins University. “In situations of scarcity where you have limited funding available for health overall, that’s going to place more and more pressure on those other disease areas that really have nothing to do with measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000e3b5v3uuv381o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            History has showed that the costs associated with an outbreak can accumulate in a short amount of time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000f3b5v7evjztri@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Each measles case can be $30,000 to $50,000 for public health response work, and that adds up quite quickly,” Sugerman said Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000g3b5vdax9yjbo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This includes testing, laboratory work, contact tracing, vaccination efforts and health-care costs, according to Dr. Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist with UTHealth Houston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000h3b5v7xn76xr7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hospitalizations can also become quite expensive, she said. The outbreak has put 63 people in the hospital across Texas and New Mexico, with another hospitalization in Kansas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000i3b5vxo1e3knu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The cost is “going to depend on how severely ill the person is … how much treatment they need [and] how long they’re in the hospital,” Troisi said. Given the contagious nature of the airborne disease, measles cases in hospitals also require proper ventilation and isolation procedures, which add to costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9kh5ohr00023b6ow0rdj2wr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to health-care and public health response, experts say there are a vast amount of indirect costs during an outbreak. For example, parents may need to take time off work to care for sick children, or there could be costs associated with transportation to and from facilities, Patenaude said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000j3b5vwa4cwjz9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles can cause a variety of complications including ear infections, pneumonia, encephalitis or death. It is especially dangerous for young and unvaccinated children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000k3b5vyl2h9xnm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been several hospitalized cases of pneumonia and at least one case of neurological symptoms from measles during this outbreak, according to Covenant Hospital in Lubbock.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000l3b5v2b9c0s0q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The more sick kids we see, it also increases the likelihood of seeing an additional death,” Wells said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9keu3ol000m3b5v84tgzy0l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been three deaths reported in this outbreak: two school-age children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico whose death is under investigation. They were all unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An exquisitely decorated 7,500-year-old antler from central Sweden was first used as a battle ax and later probably as a fishing harpoon during the Stone Age, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found the antler eight years ago, but had not been able to study it with new technology until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was probably handled as an ax," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ark.lu.se/en/person/larslarsson/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ark.lu.se/en/person/larslarsson/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lars Larsson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of archaeology at Lund University in Sweden, told Live Science. "There are several examples in present-day Denmark of antler axes with severe damage after heavy use." The damage suggests the axes were used in battle, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antler was originally discovered atop a stone platform in a river running from Lake Vättern to the Baltic Sea. It was deposited alongside several other items, including a bone needle, fishing barbs, stone ax blades, engraved animal bones and 20 pieces of human skull. The small cache was discovered at the archaeological site of Strandvägen, a settlement from the Mesolithic, or Middle Stone Age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Strandvägen site is one of the largest Mesolithic sites in Sweden, and unique in the region as preservational circumstances generally are poor in this region," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.su.se/english/profiles/sagu4039-1.191487" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.su.se/english/profiles/sagu4039-1.191487" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sara Gummesson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an archaeologist at Stockholm University in Sweden who was not involved in the study, told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/stone-age-man-facial-reconstruction.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/stone-age-man-facial-reconstruction.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This Stone Age man's jawless skull was found on a spike. Here's what he looked like.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the highly acidic soils in Sweden, organic materials typically degrade, leaving no trace. Strandvägen is exceptional in that it provides one of the few areas where organic material like antlers has been preserved. This preservation is in part because many of the organic materials were found in water, but also because the soils are in a bedrock that is less acidic, Gummesson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-aR7xxVzF35rtxWiWfb8Y8f" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-aR7xxVzF35rtxWiWfb8Y8f slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/scientists-dating-methods.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/scientists-dating-methods.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;radiocarbon dating&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of bones and artifacts at Strandvägen has shown that the region was inhabited from 5,800 to 5,000 B.C. The settlement is across the river from another important site, called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/61736-ancient-heads-on-stakes.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/61736-ancient-heads-on-stakes.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kanaljorden&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was occupied around the same time and has revealed unique finds such as heads impaled on wooden stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;A section of the ornamentation on the antler. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Lars Larsson)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The settlement is located next to the only outlet for Lake Vättern, Sweden's second largest lake," Larsson said. Groups of hunter-fisher-gatherers thrived around this outlet of the lake, using nearby forests for hunting and the lake for fishing, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior excavations at Strandvägen revealed graves, houses, workshops and numerous bone and antler tools, but this antler is the "best-decorated" of the bone and antler objects, Larsson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antler, which comes from a red deer (&lt;em&gt;Cervus elaphus&lt;/em&gt;), measures around 4.2 inches (10.7 centimeters) long and has a width of 0.8 inches (2.1 cm). Radiocarbon dating of tar found within the antler's grooves suggests it is around 7,500 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="from-ax-to-harpoon-3"&gt;From ax to harpoon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand the antler and its history, Larsson and his co-author, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Fredrik-Molin-2094051569" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Fredrik-Molin-2094051569" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fredrik Molin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an archaeologist at Sweden's National Historical Museum, studied it with a digital microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their analysis revealed that the antler was initially filed to produce even surfaces before it was carved with a flint tool to create elaborate hatch-like patterns. Tar was then rubbed into the etched grooves to accentuate the hatchlike designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears that multiple people worked on the antler, with some of the patterns appearing less precise and having been whittled down to make way for new designs. Some of the craftsmen appear to have been more skilled than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antlers served as handles that were attached to sharpened bones or stone blades, and they showed characteristic breakage when overused. This antler has that breakage pattern, suggesting that the decorated antler was likely used as an ax in battle, Larsson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further fragmentation on the antler led Larsson and Molin to believe the ax may have been repurposed into a harpoon, which is another common artifact found across the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;An illustration of the decorations on the antler artifact. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Peter Zetterlund/National Historical Museums)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, "if an item gets broken, many of us buy a new one," Gummesson said. "This was not the case until very recently."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final burial of the antler alongside other valued goods and human remains suggests the antler was ultimately buried as a sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An object may actually have changed use, been given new values, repaired and treasured in many different ways throughout its 'life', which also may have extended beyond one person's lifetime," says Gummesson.&lt;/p&gt;

                Two new studies suggest that stem-cell treatments may be getting closer to becoming widely available for Parkinson's patients.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Patients suffering from Parkinson's disease may soon benefit from a powerful treatment option: stem-cell transplants.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a pair of small studies designed primarily to test safety, two teams of researchers found that stem cells transplanted into the brains of Parkinson's patients began producing the chemical messenger dopamine and appeared to ease symptoms like tremor, researchers &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08845-y" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The results indicate that "now we have the potential to really, really halt this disease in its tracks," says &lt;a href="https://med.uth.edu/neurosciences/dr-mya-c-schiess-md/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Mya Schiess&lt;/a&gt;, a neurology professor at UTHealth Houston who was not involved in either study.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration has cleared one of the stem-cell treatments for a Phase 3 study, the last hurdle before approval.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;About 1 million people in the United States are living with Parkinson's, a brain disease that attacks neurons that make dopamine. As those neurons die, patients can develop a range of disabling symptoms, including tremor, rigidity, fatigue, difficulty walking and cognitive problems.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Stem cells are immature cells that can develop into many different cell types — including neurons that make dopamine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Positive results&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the new studies involved 12 people in the U.S. and Canada living with Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Surgeons administered either a low or high dose of a stem-cell product from BlueRock Therapeutics, a subsidiary of biotech and pharmaceutical giant Bayer. The treatment was derived from human embryonic stem cells, which researchers had coaxed into becoming immature brain cells called neuron progenitors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;During surgery, these cells were injected into a structure on each side of the brain that's involved in movement.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The idea is to place these neuron progenitors right where you need them to connect with other neurons in the brain," says &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/doctors/viviane-tabar" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Viviane Tabar&lt;/a&gt;, a stem-cell scientist and chair of neurosurgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tabar is also a founding investigator at BlueRock.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;PET scans taken 18 months later showed that the transplanted cells were producing dopamine. An assessment using a standard rating scale of Parkinson's progression suggested the treatment was also easing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For a typical Parkinson's patient, "you would expect every year to get two to three points worse," says &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/meet-researchers/lorenz-studer-work" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Lorenz Studer&lt;/a&gt;, who directs the Center for Stem Cell Biology at the Sloan Kettering Institute in New York and is a scientific adviser to BlueRock.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Participants in Studer's study had a very different experience: "The high-dose group, they got about 20 points better."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The low-dose group also appeared to benefit, but not as much.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A second study by researchers in Kyoto, Japan, used induced pluripotent stem cells, which are derived from a patient's own cells, rather than an embryo.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Seven patients had the cells injected into both sides of their brains. As in the U.S. and Canadian study, the transplanted cells produced dopamine and the patients appeared to see their symptoms decrease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;No patient in either study experienced a serious adverse event.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Long time coming&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The apparent success comes after &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5487308/#:~:text=Core%20tip%3A%20The%20first%20studies,with%20high%20variability%20among%20subjects." target="_blank"&gt;decades of frustration&lt;/a&gt; trying to replace the brain cells killed off by Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Starting in the 1980s, scientists began transplanting fetal tissue into people with Parkinson's. But the efforts produced uneven results and sometimes troubling side effects like uncontrolled movement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Stem cells promised better results. But the technology evolved slowly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Studer's team, for example, began looking at stem cells to treat brain diseases more than 25 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For us, it's quite an exciting time," he says, "finally seeing some of the fruit of that work."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One reason it's taken so long, Studer says, is that stem cells have the potential to become so many different kinds of cells. It takes just the right mix of chemicals at just the right time to produce a neuron that makes dopamine, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It took us nearly 10 years to figure out the recipe, how to make specifically those dopamine cells," he says. "It took us another 10 years to have the product that we would dare to put into patients."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another challenge was creating and packaging large numbers of stem cells that could be easily delivered to surgeons. So researchers developed techniques that allowed them to freeze stem cells until they were needed.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"You just thaw them and suspend them in an approved medium" before surgery, Tabar says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now that many of the technical hurdles have been cleared, stem cells appear poised to offer a new treatment option for Parkinson's, and perhaps other brain diseases like epilepsy or Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If we're missing neurons, we're able to replace them," Tabar says. "And the full expectation is that these cells are not going to function as cells that just release [a substance like] dopamine. They're going to rebuild circuitry."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There still may be risks though, which means scientists will need to continue monitoring the stem cells they transplant into a patient's brain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They're going to be there for a long, long time," Schiess says. "So you have to follow up and see if there is tumor formation or something of that nature."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Schiess also notes that stem cells don't cure an underlying disease like Parkinson's. So the new neurons may eventually succumb to the same disease process.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even so, she thinks they could offer new hope to many patients, including those who are no longer responding to drug treatment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

With a record number of parents seeking vaccine exemptions for their children and childhood vaccination rates declining, more outbreaks of measles, pertussis, and other diseases are not just likely, they’re inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“When vaccination rates fall, the first disease you’re going to see show up is measles because it’s so contagious, but others will follow,” says Ari Brown, a pediatrician in Texas, the epicenter of the current measles outbreak, and a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. “This is a troublesome trend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Last year, there were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;285 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; for all of 2024. This year, cases have already risen to over 700, and two children &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak"}' href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;have died of the disease&lt;/a&gt;. Children have also been dying of whooping cough. In Louisiana, two infants died of the disease in the past six months—the state’s first deaths from the illness since 2018—according to a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.facebook.com/61561728868838/posts/the-louisiana-department-of-health-is-closely-monitoring-ongoing-increased-pertu/122146254860390962/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.facebook.com/61561728868838/posts/the-louisiana-department-of-health-is-closely-monitoring-ongoing-increased-pertu/122146254860390962/"}' href="https://www.facebook.com/61561728868838/posts/the-louisiana-department-of-health-is-closely-monitoring-ongoing-increased-pertu/122146254860390962/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recent statement&lt;/a&gt; by the state’s surgeon general.

And in February, a local health department in Washington confirmed that a Spokane County child under the age of 5 &lt;a data-offer-url="https://srhd.org/news/srhd-reports-pertussis-death-in-spokane-county" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://srhd.org/news/srhd-reports-pertussis-death-in-spokane-county"}' href="https://srhd.org/news/srhd-reports-pertussis-death-in-spokane-county" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;died of whooping cough&lt;/a&gt;—the first in the state since 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;A type of bacterial infection, whooping cough is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It causes flu-like symptoms and violent, rapid coughing. It’s known for the characteristic, high-pitched “whoop” sound when someone inhales after a coughing fit. The disease is especially dangerous for babies because it can interfere with their breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Nationwide, there were 35,435 cases of whooping cough in 2024, compared with 7,063 in 2023, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf"&gt;provisional surveillance report&lt;/a&gt; from the CDC. Cases hit a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html"&gt;low of 2,116 in 2021&lt;/a&gt; due to social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic and were still on the rebound in 2023. Yet 2024’s numbers far outpaced the 18,617 cases seen in 2019 and 15,609 cases in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The disease can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, and death. Infants and young children are particularly at risk. Around a third of infants under six months old who came down with whooping cough in 2024 required hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“The crux of the disease is that it’s caused by this particular bacteria, &lt;em&gt;Bordetella pertussis&lt;/em&gt;, which creates a toxin, and that toxin can be very damaging to our lungs,” says Amy Edwards, associate professor of pediatrics at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Vaccination is the best way to protect against infection and severe disease. The diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, or DTaP, vaccine is given in five doses in infancy and early childhood. Immunity from vaccination and natural infection eventually wanes, and a booster shot is recommended at age 11 or 12 and every 10 years after, including for adults. The CDC advises pregnant people to get a booster during each pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNY3doVzlnMF9JR2pkR3owb2w3TnRPaV9XT3NlU2RZeW94RHI1XzdaNDFIc1ZldDBCVUZiWmFZWTFlQW1vNy1PdmJIcnZ0ekp6UGVMWVhwMWFGanR3VTdyb3k3b2tuSW9QMWgxeWR5cGY3Sm8zeG5MNzVadWdYUjE4TGhoWWpKbDkw</guid></item><item><title>倡导者说， RFK Jr.的健康削减使结束HIV的目标遥不可及- HuffPost | Advocates Say RFK Jr.’s Health Cuts Put Goal Of Ending HIV Out Of Reach - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQYVcxaXpER012NmFZTUhkYTlBVkt4UlNPSzFhNzE3dV9rNmhNak9TRXRFYmVSckhwQmp1MXh3ZUI3MXpjUTRxYkhFTGhSWk9vU3RYaHVEUEFXNmZEU2RvMXpsWXdJTDFHWDNvWllWTUlxeFVvWlc1YjlPcGxJWmZyZ2lBMUZoaDNVMHh6SjVTZTU1OW9R0gGaAUFVX3lxTE5iOTBEeXdLRGJBYndrSDRweURiU2NUUkVyeEg2UV9GNnU4OHM0cmE1Sk8yV2JlZHpwUXdIUkNNWWJzM0JjT0RHLTNJcXBLRk90UWQ0Rm9NbWg3NVBsUmVFSEhyZ2Y1NHI0YW5GRXEzVmp0NzE5eHBGMDYxOHZIWWR2UXhaSGU3YmhwMXAzcVBmMmdfaWVWV194Ymc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors and public health advocates were once able to imagine the end of the HIV epidemic in our lifetime.

The proposed budget slashes one-third of the agency’s spending, and eliminates funding for HIV services, including the Minority AIDS Initiative, several Ryan White HIV/AIDS programs, the CDC’s HIV/AIDs prevention and surveillance activities, and preventive services for elderly people and people living with disabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s spelling out a situation where we’re going to see more people get HIV and die from AIDS in the U.S. and internationally,” said Jeremiah Johnson, the executive director of PrEP 4 All, an HIV advocacy organization pushing for a nationwide program to boost access to preventive medication to underinsured communities. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The cuts across federal health agencies have left funding to research institutions dedicated to improving HIV care in limbo. Over the last four months numerous grants were terminated for HIV studies and programs, including a clinical trial to help youth living with or at risk of HIV access vaccines, a trauma-informed study on the role of violence in the lives of women living with HIV, a trial to determine whether Black and Latin men are more likely to stay on PrEP with the help of a patient navigator, and numerous studies on the barriers trans women face to HIV prevention care around the world. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In total, the National Institute of Health has terminated nearly 770 active research grants as of the beginning of April, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://airtable.com/appjhyo9NTvJLocRy/shrNto1NNp9eJlgpA?Ffj6Q%3Asort=eyJwZWwxblJuTkNGdW9YWDNjRiI6eyJjb2x1bW5JZCI6ImZsZDIyd3Jsb080MEVONFlIIiwiYXNjZW5kaW5nIjpmYWxzZX19&amp;amp;Ffj6Q=sfsl6mgALdADKsxfP" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a database" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680025ebe4b0485a7732be89" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://airtable.com/appjhyo9NTvJLocRy/shrNto1NNp9eJlgpA?Ffj6Q%3Asort=eyJwZWwxblJuTkNGdW9YWDNjRiI6eyJjb2x1bW5JZCI6ImZsZDIyd3Jsb080MEVONFlIIiwiYXNjZW5kaW5nIjpmYWxzZX19&amp;amp;Ffj6Q=sfsl6mgALdADKsxfP" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;a database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; kept by academics tracking the cuts.

PrEP, which is taken routinely in pill form, provides nearly complete protection against the virus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But almost two-thirds of the 1.2 million people who could benefit from PrEP are not taking the medication, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/director-letters/expanding-prep-coverage.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="CDC data" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680025ebe4b0485a7732be89" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/director-letters/expanding-prep-coverage.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;CDC data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The vast majority of people who currently have access to PrEP are white, despite making up a small percentage of new diagnoses. By comparison, Black and Latino populations, and trans women all experience higher and growing rates of HIV diagnoses, especially in Southern and rural areas. These communities face significant barriers to accessing PrEP, including lack of health insurance or other financial barriers, and discrimination in health care settings. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Public health advocates and scientists have researched ways to address these disparities and boost the use of PrEP among at-risk communities.

If approved, it would be the second injectable PrEP on the market, following the approval of cabotegravir in 2021. Both long-acting drugs are also used in treatment for people living with HIV, and offer an alternative to people who deal with pill fatigue. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, Johnson anticipates that “we won’t see the kind of launch that we had hoped for” for PrEP “to get out to communities” as the Trump administration continues to slash funding towards HIV prevention research, and as RFK Jr. promotes “non-evidence based understandings of HIV science.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Here we are at a moment of innovation, and rather than capitalize on all of that, we’re going to turn our backs and see more HIV infections and more health care expenditures due to new HIV infections, and a lot more sickness and suffering for our communities,” Johnson said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the past, HHS has promoted low or no cost PrEP to patients through programs like Ready, Set, PrEP, for example. The program was started by then-President Donald Trump in 2019 as part of his Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative. The future of that program is now uncertain as the preliminary HHS budget axes funding for the Ending the HIV Epidemic plan altogether. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But with RFK Jr. at the helm of the agency, Trump’s initial goalpost for tackling HIV is now much further away. RFK Jr. has a history of discrediting vaccine efficacy, and championing junk science to insist that changes in lifestyle and nutrition could combat chronic illness. In particular, he has questioned the HIV epidemic, including whether the human immunodeficiency virus causes the chronic condition of AIDS, which it does, and instead attributed the condition to the use of poppers, a recreational drug popular in queer communities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Ofole Mgbako, an HIV doctor and assistant professor of medicine and population health at NYU Langone Health, warns that the loss of consistent treatment for HIV could lead to new strains of the virus that are resistant to the drugs currently on hand. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Treatment interruptions and people being on and off of treatment can breed resistance to the virus. We have not yet found a cure,” Mgbako said. “We have found really effective treatments to keep the virus suppressed within someone’s body, but that means they have to remain on treatment consistently.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many of the cuts to grants came after Trump signed several executive orders instructing agencies to axe programs dedicated to improving “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” or addressing trans or broader LGBTQ+ communities. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In mid-February, nine nonprofit community health and advocacy organizations focused on servicing the health needs of the LGBTQ+ community, including HIV prevention and treatment, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://lambdalegal.org/case/san-francisco-aids-foundation-v-trump/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="sued the Trump administration" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680025ebe4b0485a7732be89" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://lambdalegal.org/case/san-francisco-aids-foundation-v-trump/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;&lt;span&gt;sued the Trump administration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, alleging that the executive orders resulted in their grants being terminated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Among them was the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, which had received a grant concurrently with the University of California San Francisco, to study the effectiveness of Doxy PEP, a drug that helps to prevent bacterial sexually transmitted infections after sex. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leading charity British Heart Foundation (BHF) has suggested that "beetroot juice might help lower blood pressure".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The charity elaborated: "Beetroot juice can be a concentrated source of nitrates, and it’s thought that one of their effects is to lower blood pressure."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31442782" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nitrates can also be found in other fruits and vegetables, such as spinach, celery, kale, bananas and strawberries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diet plays a crucial role in managing blood pressure levels; healthy eating is one of the best ways to reduce blood pressure readings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to fruits and vegetables, eating wholegrains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy is recommended.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are the foundations for the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"[The DASH diet] has been shown to be helpful by numerous studies," the BHF noted, expanding on each component.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take wholegrains, for example, which are rich in fibre and are "linked to a lower risk of heart and circulatory diseases".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31442764" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

But since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took charge of H.H.S., the Trump administration has indicated that it will stop funding research on the health effects of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The N.I.H. said in an internal document obtained by The New York Times that it was the agency’s new policy “not to prioritize” research related to climate change. The document also described the organization’s intent not to fund research on gender identity, vaccine hesitancy or diversity, equity and inclusion.

They’re all store cupboard essentials, easily paired, and found at your local supermarket and all over the world: Rice and lentils or rice and black beans, hummus and bread, rice and peas, couscous and chickpeas...The combos go on! Of course, some plant foods are richer in protein than others. I listed them in the notes app on my phone when I gave up meat, to make sure I remembered them when shopping and get to include them in my diet with ease. Below, I’m breaking that down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;My four golden rules for eating more protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;30 grams of protein at breakfast
This is a commandment exulted by all health and wellness experts, and underlined by Dr. Emilie Steinbach: “A &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/30-grams-of-protein-for-breakfast" target="_blank"&gt;higher-protein breakfast&lt;/a&gt; improves the feeling of satiety and reduces hunger and appetite, and therefore cravings, throughout the day, even late in the day. To achieve all of these benefits, protein intake would need to be between 25 and 35 grams and account for 40 per cent of the total calorie intake of breakfast.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To hit this target, I generally incorporate two to three eggs into my breakfast—one egg equals 6 grams protein. Often, I place them on two toasted slices of Nordic, rye, or spelt bread (that makes 5 to 7 grams of protein), hummus (2 grams of protein), and sprouted seeds on top (&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/fenugreek-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;fenugreek&lt;/a&gt; is my go-to). Other days, I’ll do an omelette with either chia seeds, hemp seeds, or &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/brewers-yeast" target="_blank"&gt;brewer’s yeast&lt;/a&gt;, and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Optimized snacks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My snack breaks are a key way boost my daily protein intake. A handful of almonds (21 grams of protein per 100 grams) accompanies a precious square of dark chocolate—or two, or three…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I eat a banana, I add peanut butter (25 grams of protein per 100 grams) and sometimes put it on a slice of toasted bread with chia seeds on top. I also occasionally have sheep’s yoghurt, skyr, or a smoothie in which I incorporate chia seeds or &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/amal-clooney-diet-breakfast" target="_blank"&gt;spirulina powder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Sprinkle everything with seeds and powders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sprinkle seeds and powders everywhere! I even carry a small glass jar containing a mix of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/hemp-seeds" target="_blank"&gt;hemp seeds&lt;/a&gt; (30 to 35 grams of protein per 100 grams) and brewer’s yeast (you may be surprised to know it’s very high in protein: 46 grams per 100 grams), which I take with me to restaurants to sprinkle on my salads. I even take it with me on vacation!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 08:10:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNRUdZZko2NnlUa0hBYkU1ekRSTlh1enNqSXM5ZDNkZkc3UXhrZnFLWkwyYzU1RzB1bkM3dGtnanRqYzF6MURkNG9DcDZfZVlBZllIQXIyTENlOUJZUmtCMTZLLVU4SC1BaUMyNmxVaUhqcnd4bDNoNDBGVHg5MThUd3g4cmd2dFJPVGc</guid></item><item><title>每天吃两片普通水果可以“显着”降低胆固醇水平- Surrey Live | Eating two pieces of common fruit each day can 'significantly' lower cholesterol levels - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxQcElTbFlXdGMxZ2pXWEpCdGpSR2ltWmIxbmdkOVNiVm1YV0xkYm1GVTRFVDZBU0lOVm5kQUl2M1QwVGF6X0J6WDM4clJBekx4Ny1WYV90ZktOM3A4LXQyRHRZbndSbnlyODBGdWVNNklBdzh0NEQxZm83U3o4TjdIMWxRcnpzZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having an excess of the fatty substance cholesterol in one's blood is what constitutes high cholesterol. This can lead to serious health issues as it contributes to the formation of blockages within blood vessels over time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consequently, individuals with high cholesterol are at a greater risk for medical crises like strokes and heart attacks. Diet is listed among the multiple factors that could cause high cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In particular, consuming an excessive amount of saturated fat has been shown to heighten cholesterol levels. Nonetheless, certain foods have been identified as effective in lowering cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An expert has urged that a common piece of fruit found on UK supermarket shelves should be consumed more frequently for this specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GloucestershireLive cited nutritionist Eli Brecher asserting: "Apples are a nutrient-dense fruit, containing 10 percent of your daily vitamin C intake, alongside copper, vitamin K and vitamin E. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"An apple a day is a great habit for a healthy heart as not only does the pectin help to lower cholesterol but the polyphenols in apples are linked to lower blood pressure and a reduced risk of a stroke."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, research published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2020 supports this claim. The study, which involved collaboration between researchers from the UK and Italy, concluded that consuming two apples daily can lead to a notable decrease in cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specific findings from the study, which saw 40 participants eat two apples each day for eight weeks, revealed a drop in their cholesterol measurements. Researchers have discovered that daily apple consumption can lead to healthier, more relaxed blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This effect is similar to what is observed with other foods rich in natural compounds called polyphenols, such as red wine and tea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Julie Lovegrove, senior author of the study from the Hugh Sinclair Unit of Human Nutrition at the University of Reading, remarked: "It seems the old adage of an apple day was nearly right." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apples are rich in a type of flavonoid known as procyanidins, which possess potent antioxidant properties and may help reduce low-density lipids (LDL or "bad" cholesterol).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The high concentration of antioxidants in apples could potentially offer protection against neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and help maintain brain function. The skin and core of the apple are also packed with pectin, a type of soluble fibre, which has been shown to improve blood cholesterol levels, a risk factor for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, studies have shown that drinking apple juice, which does not contain pectin, does not yield the same cholesterol-lowering benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Health benefits in test&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether an apple a day will keep the doctor away is questionable, although one study of 8,000 adults published in JAMA Internal Medicine that looked at hospital and doctor appointments by apple-eaters and non-apple eaters did find that people who ate at least one a day were slightly less likely to visit a GP. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are definite benefits to making apples a daily habit, though. They contain less vitamin C than oranges but more fibre than melons and twice as much as pears. Many of the benefits are linked to pectin, the soluble dietary fibre that is found predominantly in the skin and core of apples. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Pectin, also found in pears and plums, has been shown in studies, including a review in the journal Clinical Nutrition, to improve blood cholesterol levels,” says the registered nutritionist Rob Hobson, author of Unprocess Your Life. “That will help to reduce the risk of heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Are your cholesterol levels too high?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A healthy total cholesterol level in the blood is considered to be five or less millimoles per litre (mmol/l). More specifically, a healthy level of high-density lipoprotein is one or more mmol/l.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And you should have four or less mmol/l of low-density lipoprotein. The only way to be certain of your cholesterol levels is to have them checked. If you're worried about your cholesterol levels, it's advisable to consult with your GP.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more information on cholesterol levels from the &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/high-cholesterol/cholesterol-levels/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;click here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 06:57:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQcElTbFlXdGMxZ2pXWEpCdGpSR2ltWmIxbmdkOVNiVm1YV0xkYm1GVTRFVDZBU0lOVm5kQUl2M1QwVGF6X0J6WDM4clJBekx4Ny1WYV90ZktOM3A4LXQyRHRZbndSbnlyODBGdWVNNklBdzh0NEQxZm83U3o4TjdIMWxRcnpzZw</guid></item><item><title>每天步行30分钟的20个好处-印度时报 | 20 benefits of walking for 30 minutes every day - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2wFBVV95cUxQR1U5MEdQYlVtQXA2YnZuQVlhLU95cW9lRDZ2R1pZWVZkQXFKTHNLSk9oSlJWZEE2M2I3VlhKSWFZd1VOSko4cmM4TlQxZGN0QklTRnNZenIzejFfNzFsLVUzUkJYM19UQ1ctSWdkV044WTVPWDFzRGxFUDU2ZldEV09xRG5YTTFpY0ZWbXE1UHFyZFltcFdoYWV4ZC1YOFBlUTBRWXgybXo0QzlxY0ZwcDZWak05UEFRS196MVNUSjBVUDRvelFYVGJBNGgwZkh0d1lHOElDRzlJMm_SAeABQVVfeXFMTlFIUjJXWm5HUVREOUI5LWdUMU5aQTNIVTlLbTZvanNINUlyU2stYXdnR0ZPMTRqM0EtWWY5aGlQb3gyRGIxYUFkRWt6Zi1obWF3N1dlU0h1ZTZud09EeDliVEU5WFlmUTJYak5IU1Y2TjY1WUctRlRXM2F5b0JybkhaeE1CN0gyejNHUXBxSi11bjdOODFJWTRBY1dfOFNuM2RfNVVrc09PUGg5eDlIWEFRaWVndER5LW5hajlmeGc0cndMdTBWWnduUlVOaTd6c3dNdHZBSGpUekZWX1UzdWM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is therapeutic in itself. A brisk 30-minute walk may seem like nothing much when every other person talks about complex workouts to stay fit. However, it can work wonders for your physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Here are 20 science-backed benefits of walking for 30 minutes every day that will inspire you to lace up your shoes and go out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Reduces the risk of heart diseases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you walk regularly, it helps control blood pressure and lower cholesterol levels, which will in turn help in improving cardiovascular health. Walking may reduce your risk of heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Helps to maintain a healthy weight&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, weight gain and obesity are one real concern for folks these days. Walking burns calories, and boosts metabolism, which can help you achieve weight loss results faster. It also aids in digestion, making it an easy and sustainable way to maintain weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe walking for 30 minutes a day can significantly improve your mental well-being?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Reduces your stress levels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress buster? Go for a walk! A daily walk gives your mind a break, helps regulate cortisol (the stress hormone), and can even trigger the release of endorphins, your body’s natural mood elevators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Increases your energy levels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you feel fatigued often? Try walking for 30 minutes. Even when you're tired, walking gets your blood circulating and your muscles moving — leaving you feeling more energized and alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Helps to boost your mind&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking increases oxygen flow to the brain, sharpens memory function, and enhances focus. It also provides mental clarity and even memory retention. It’s a natural brain booster!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Gets the blood pumping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your body requires a regular blood flow throughout the nerves and cells. A walk stimulates circulation, which nourishes your organs and muscles with fresh oxygen and nutrients, keeping your entire system healthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Prevents obesity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excess fat is an invitation to several diseases. Walking combats sedentary lifestyles, helps regulate appetite, and improves fat metabolism — all of which are key in preventing obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Can help to reduce anxiety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling anxious lately? Go for a walk. Physical movement like walking has a calming effect on the nervous system, helping to ease anxious thoughts and promote mental balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Increases functioning of the lungs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With each step and breath, walking strengthens lung capacity. It fills the lungs with fresh oxygen which helps improve oxygen exchange, making your respiratory system more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10. Improves your body’s access to Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting out for a walk naturally makes you get enough vitamin D for your body. Walking outdoors allows your skin to soak in sunlight, which is crucial for vitamin D synthesis — essential for bones, mood, and immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;11. Reduces the risk of cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer prevention may be a claim, but walking does cut the risk factors that may be causing it. Regular walking may help reduce the risk of several cancers, especially breast and colon cancer, by improving immunity and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;12. Improves sleep quality&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep is the root cause of many health issues. A consistent walking routine helps regulate your sleep-wake cycle and reduces insomnia, especially if done during the day in natural light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;13. Gives you time for self-care&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding it difficult to get time for yourself? Start by walking for 30 minutes. It can also be the perfect time to listen to music, podcasts, or simply enjoy your own thoughts — offering a daily dose of mindfulness and self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;14. Improves coordination and balance&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing balance as we age is a real thing. Regular walking strengthens lower body muscles and joints, improving your balance and reducing the risk of falls, especially as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;15. Improves quality of life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to upgrade your life? Start walking. From mental clarity to better fitness and reduced disease risk, the overall effect of walking daily leads to a more active, confident, and fulfilling lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;16. Reduces chances of diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking helps regulate blood sugar levels and improves insulin sensitivity, making it a powerful habit that can balance the blood sugar to prevent or manage type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;17. Walking can spark creativity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thoughts seldom come to those who stay still. Studies have shown that walking — especially outdoors — boosts creative thinking and problem-solving, making it great for brainstorming sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;18. Strengthens bones and muscles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want stronger bones? Walking is a low-impact, weight-bearing exercise that supports bone density and strengthens major muscle groups, especially in the legs and core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;19. Can improve blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypertension is a new-age epidemic. A brisk walk every day can help lower systolic blood pressure, offering a natural way to manage or prevent hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;20. May strengthen the immune system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to look for ways to bolster your immunity? Moderate daily exercise, like walking for 30 minutes, enhances immune response by promoting healthy circulation and reducing chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just 30 minutes of daily walking can have significant positive effects on your body and mind; you don't need expensive equipment or a gym membership. Every step counts, whether you're taking a leisurely stroll in the park or a vigorous walk around your neighborhood.

Not just the corners of the glam circles, the popular weight loss drug has found its way to common American household as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Ozempic has made its name as one of the leading drugs in the weight loss game, it comes with a fair share of cons, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of them is rapidly growing, making quite a stir on the internet - it’s Ozempic feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Ozempic?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozempic (semaglutide) is a well-known prescription drug that’s used to treat the blood sugar of people with type 2 diabetes. Ozempic is given as an injection under your skin. Ozempic is also used to lower the risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, or death) in people who have type 2 diabetes and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration first approved the injectable medication for treating diabetes in 2017; the agency approved a drug with a higher dose of the active ingredient in Ozempic, called semaglutide, to treat obesity in 2021, under the brand name Wegovy. Since then, talk of the drug has popped up across the internet. The prescription drug keeps gaining attention as celebrities, a tech mogul, and TikTok influencers have described taking it to lose weight in short time frames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Ozempic feet?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports online claimed that “Ozempic feet” is one of the side effects of GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro. Netizens have speculated whether celebrities like &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/sharon-osbourne" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Sharon Osbourne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/oprah-winfrey" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Oprah Winfrey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have started showing unexpected foot-related side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what exactly happens when one has Ozempic feet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Ozempic feet’ is a side effect of rapid weight loss induced by the drug, referring to the changes in the feet due to a sudden loss of fat padding in the soles. This can lead to a feeling of walking on bone, soreness, and difficulty standing for extended periods. Additionally, the reduced fat can make veins and tendons more visible, potentially leading to a perceived older appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms, Ozempic feet is the sagging and wrinkling of one’s skin on the feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 medication is generally prescribed for type-2 diabetes but has gained popularity for its weight loss effects.

Not just the corners of the glam circles, the popular weight loss drug has found its way to common American household as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Ozempic has made its name as one of the leading drugs in the weight loss game, it comes with a fair share of cons, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of them is rapidly growing, making quite a stir on the internet - it’s Ozempic feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Ozempic?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozempic (semaglutide) is a well-known prescription drug that’s used to treat the blood sugar of people with type 2 diabetes. Ozempic is given as an injection under your skin. Ozempic is also used to lower the risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, or death) in people who have type 2 diabetes and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration first approved the injectable medication for treating diabetes in 2017; the agency approved a drug with a higher dose of the active ingredient in Ozempic, called semaglutide, to treat obesity in 2021, under the brand name Wegovy. Since then, talk of the drug has popped up across the internet. The prescription drug keeps gaining attention as celebrities, a tech mogul, and TikTok influencers have described taking it to lose weight in short time frames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Ozempic feet?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports online claimed that “Ozempic feet” is one of the side effects of GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro. Netizens have speculated whether celebrities like &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/sharon-osbourne" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Sharon Osbourne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/oprah-winfrey" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Oprah Winfrey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have started showing unexpected foot-related side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what exactly happens when one has Ozempic feet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Ozempic feet’ is a side effect of rapid weight loss induced by the drug, referring to the changes in the feet due to a sudden loss of fat padding in the soles. This can lead to a feeling of walking on bone, soreness, and difficulty standing for extended periods. Additionally, the reduced fat can make veins and tendons more visible, potentially leading to a perceived older appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms, Ozempic feet is the sagging and wrinkling of one’s skin on the feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 medication is generally prescribed for type-2 diabetes but has gained popularity for its weight loss effects. However, several stars have admitted to taking the medication to aid their weight loss journey, including Sharon and Oprah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharon has not only admitted to taking Ozempic but also said she “went too far” with it, losing “three stone [42 pounds] in four months.” The TV personality’s recent photograph of herself cozying up on a couch with her grandson left people surprised by the appearance of her feet, with people claiming, “The feet don’t match the face.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per reports, media mogul Oprah also faced widespread speculation about whether she was experiencing the “Ozempic feet” phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes Ozempic feet?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors note that any sudden change in weight, especially one achieved through drug methods, can affect soft tissue, elasticity of the skin, and distribution of fat.

Kennedy has said that the best way to prevent measles is to get vaccinated – but he has also caused alarm among paediatricians, vaccine experts and lawmakers by promoting vitamin A and nutrition as treatments for measles and questioning the safety testing of the MMR vaccine. He also recently announced a US-led scientific effort to establish the cause of what he terms the ‘autism epidemic’, with some experts concerned that this study will support the widely discredited association between autism and vaccines. US health reporter Jessica Glenza tells Ian Sample, the Guardian’s science editor, how these mixed messages are already impacting scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxNcjJuN2F3alVQS2J4N3B4dElWZ3ZmZlZHNDVTRHBjbkZQVFFfbDdLT3lKUXNudTk2SUhaZ2g4a1pkTGtDenlRT2xhb3h3NnlsdVNHWExsTDJDUENna1RHWFNMcTcxWW4xb3dJRzVpMTNnVlUzQjM2YWNaRGEtZl8ycThhalF5NEdNeXM0cklUZVJzU0RUUWs3RVN3UEQ4ZU9PckxUNC03X3RvZUM5YXEzU1NKZ19ZT0pjNW9BQ3FNbE9ZTzl4TnhyaG5UYWVUZnM</guid></item><item><title>营养专家揭示了排名第一的食品交换以降低中风风险- SciTechDaily | Nutrition Expert Reveals the #1 Food Swap To Reduce Stroke Risk - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxPZ0hDMmI3VEYzcU1YVVBBN3g5LUlTTTUxREZhTDhJVnZjNTgxQzFySnBSTWdkTGRrZXNQSWJ5aXJkMVBWcmdORWZQWGVRUkpJWWdla0lvU1ZaOEdJUzZwVzhCaGdobU1CemdkTFdURjdtUWh5SUNHWlg5VHpmQUpJempGR3J0NU8tanNkZ0MwZnc5UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 03:20:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxPZ0hDMmI3VEYzcU1YVVBBN3g5LUlTTTUxREZhTDhJVnZjNTgxQzFySnBSTWdkTGRrZXNQSWJ5aXJkMVBWcmdORWZQWGVRUkpJWWdla0lvU1ZaOEdJUzZwVzhCaGdobU1CemdkTFdURjdtUWh5SUNHWlg5VHpmQUpJempGR3J0NU8tanNkZ0MwZnc5UQ</guid></item><item><title>实验药物在临床前研究中有效治疗阿尔茨海默氏症- SciTechDaily | Experimental Drug Effectively Treats Alzheimer’s in Preclinical Study - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOV2IwcTBXYW1qM1I1ZVMzdERnX05qdmxXVjlCSWdZUGJ3VTlFMVltdDlGMTQyeXE4ajZGSW1PYW5tM1piU3NxeFhvcVloNFVPQUJiQ3BPOXZaZ0xLaFBQVlZTRFN1V3ppTjdNYWFNZEhmdWVBRS16RXJlMldGa3Rnc25WLWRNcy1TTmQ0Uk9jY19VV0lsWThUb2FB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 02:17:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOV2IwcTBXYW1qM1I1ZVMzdERnX05qdmxXVjlCSWdZUGJ3VTlFMVltdDlGMTQyeXE4ajZGSW1PYW5tM1piU3NxeFhvcVloNFVPQUJiQ3BPOXZaZ0xLaFBQVlZTRFN1V3ppTjdNYWFNZEhmdWVBRS16RXJlMldGa3Rnc25WLWRNcy1TTmQ0Uk9jY19VV0lsWThUb2FB</guid></item><item><title>专家关于RSV和脑膜炎疫苗的建议将提交给疾病预防控制中心的前检察官-美联社新闻 | Experts recommendations on RSV and meningitis vaccines will go to ex-prosecutor now at CDC - AP News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxQcWlUdE1WTko2TXdFaVNtWjFHYmpoeVNUeHhKTUVRdGJlUDJUc0E0MG9UVGFFclRNMm1HSHdoS2dLc25zUzgyY25TcmtGZ1lfWDlneG1CZno2Y0dYRTFpYVNwV204X3g0cmdDaVo0VHJ6MUVhcHFsSGN2dWZNNC1xXzNDMlhUTW43VjI1NGlXQWJkTU1KNW94ZzJnVk90akEwMGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 02:17:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxQcWlUdE1WTko2TXdFaVNtWjFHYmpoeVNUeHhKTUVRdGJlUDJUc0E0MG9UVGFFclRNMm1HSHdoS2dLc25zUzgyY25TcmtGZ1lfWDlneG1CZno2Y0dYRTFpYVNwV204X3g0cmdDaVo0VHJ6MUVhcHFsSGN2dWZNNC1xXzNDMlhUTW43VjI1NGlXQWJkTU1KNW94ZzJnVk90akEwMGc</guid></item><item><title>医生透露，常见的烹饪成分与侵袭性癌症有关-纽约邮报 | Common cooking ingredient linked to aggressive form of cancer, doctor reveals - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOdlFpUklBbVlhaFA0ZE1SX1laSG12XzRlYU95cnB0QWxGSUZnZnYyV1E0REpScThONzltSkZ2UVNXWGdIX3FYaVo2Nl9UYzNXeEkyaGFVUDIwakJ6M2RGV29NSjhmdFI1cC1iUnFfUjFHdkwwb0g2S0g2YUdUaDBGeW1XbV82OU1tOG00LUQ0TEM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;

1024px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Seed and vegetable oils are staples in many kitchens.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;nenetus – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To further back up that claim, new research by &lt;a href="https://news.weill.cornell.edu/news/2025/04/omega-6-fatty-acid-promotes-the-growth-of-an-aggressive-type-of-breast-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Weill Cornell Medicine&lt;/a&gt; discovered that linoleic acid — a fat found in seed, vegetable and nut oils causes breast cancer cells to multiply and grow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are different forms of breast cancer — and the constant use of linoleic acid puts women at risk of developing the most aggressive type: triple-negative.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this invasive form spreads faster and requires a more aggressive treatment plan — which might include a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and sometimes radiation therapy. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The survival rate is also lower — at 77% compared to regular breast cancer which is around 90%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We now know that linoleic acid feeds cancer cell growth in a very specific way,” said Dr. John Blenis, the study’s senior author and a cancer researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blenis seems optimistic about this discovery because he feels that it “sheds light on how to define which patients might benefit from specific nutritional recommendations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And before people panic over this news, “The findings do not warrant blanket avoidance of seed oils but suggest moderation and selectivity, especially for high-risk individuals,” Blenis reassured.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The expert went on to say that this discovery is just one piece of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A balanced, whole food diet remains an important cornerstone of cancer prevention, and a strategy everyone can adopt,” the doctor explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re unsure what is considered a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/31/health/are-seed-oils-really-that-bad-for-you-dietitians-explain-the-risk/"&gt;seed oil&lt;/a&gt; — canola, corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, soy, sunflower, safflower and rice all fit the bill. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Seed oils are high in omega-6 fatty acids and lower in omega-3s — and that’s where the problem lies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The problem seems to be in the proportions of the two fats that we take in,” Stephanie Schiff, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Northwell Huntington Hospital told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We tend to get a higher than healthy ratio of omega-6s to omega-3s and that can lead to problems with inflammation in the body,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, these oils should be used in moderation and this news reinstates that people should eat a balanced diet consisting of fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

"Depression prevalence decreased with increasing age. Overall, prevalence was highest in adolescents ages 12–19 (19.2%) and lowest in adults age 60 and older (8.7%)," it found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings come from a federal survey conducted between August 2021 and August 2023. Participants were asked whether they had experienced specific symptoms linked to depression in the previous two weeks. Their responses to these validated screening questions were then scored to assess whether they met the criteria for depression. Depression symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;How can depression be effectively managed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is depression? Is it preventable?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Major depression is a common and treatable mood disorder characterized by changes in cognitive and physical symptoms lasting for at least 2 weeks," the US CDC defines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is a lot more than just a bad mood or feeling low. It’s a mental health condition that affects how you think, feel, and act. It can make even the smallest tasks feel like climbing a mountain. And the tricky part? You can’t always see it. Someone may look perfectly fine on the outside but be battling a storm within.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression, often misunderstood as being lazy or overthinking, is a real, medical condition that needs just as much attention as a physical illness. It affects millions globally and is becoming more common, especially with the fast-paced, high-stress lifestyle many of us lead today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building healthy habits early on—like regular exercise, eating nutritious food, getting enough sleep, staying socially connected, and managing stress—can all help protect your mental health. Think of it as creating a strong base so your mind has something solid to stand on during tough times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression doesn’t look the same for everyone, but here are some common signs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling sad, hopeless, or empty most of the time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Losing interest in things you usually enjoy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Changes in appetite or weight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trouble sleeping—or sleeping too much&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling tired or low on energy all the time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty concentrating or making decisions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling worthless or guilty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thoughts of self-harm or suicide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any of these last more than two weeks and interfere with your daily life, it's a sign you might need support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to deal with depression&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step is to acknowledge what you’re feeling. And know that it’s okay to not be okay. You don’t have to tough it out alone. Talk to someone you trust—a friend, a family member, or a professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to a therapist or counselor. Therapy isn’t just for “serious” cases—it’s a safe space to sort through your thoughts. Move your body, even a 15-minute walk can help your brain release feel-good chemicals. Eat right and hydrate, your gut and brain are connected. Junk food can mess with your mood. Stick to a routine, even small daily rituals—like making your bed or taking a morning shower—can create a sense of structure. Limit screen time, social media can sometimes amplify negative feelings. A little digital detox can work wonders. Try journaling or mindfulness, writing down your thoughts or just sitting quietly with your breath can help you feel more grounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 01:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswJBVV95cUxPdk9USHRYTHlrZVctVkZIVkszX1JtcEs2VVc2SmdXREVmUDlnbVRZaUpEOWM3ZFhwaFV2bkVQVkRoZTE2SnFYam9wRmZqcGRsUGVCOGdPQlNwVGFJT09FYkVvdjgtU0RxZVZMT1hQa1lJZlpTOW9QM2ZFUTlWSmZWLThUb05YMi1PQzJLTmhRcW5fV3dRTTFOLXRJVlgwcnNtY25PUjRHNjRreFlsSF9YZDNYSUh6UXc1UFVQbnptZmdFbmQzOXlGZmk5aHFYQ2pSTDF5aFFPSWVTWmxjS0sycnJMNjZLYkx5a0lDLTdxNG9MVnFzZHNmcmtXVVFJY3FCSk9udEU3YkFfN01TTEdkVGpIZDl2SWEtRFVTb3JHb19nNU9ESnh3bnBLdnRNS2dfZ0lz</guid></item><item><title>您是否在20分钟内吃完一顿饭？可能是时候放慢脚步了- VINnews | Do You Eat a Meal in 20 Minutes or Less?

&lt;p&gt;Experts tend to focus on the kinds of foods you can eat to improve your health. But the speed at which you devour your dinner matters just as much. There are risks with eating too fast — think stuck food and the potential to overeat before your brain tells you to stop. (Inhaling your food also risks annoying your slower-paced dining companions or the person who took the time to cook your meal.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips from scientists on how to slow down and take a more mindful approach to consuming your &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-norwalk-health-nutrition-fd87eae765ce4775a868a8aa74ddd94f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How fast is too fast?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re the kind of person who can regularly polish off breakfast, lunch or dinner in less than 20-30 minutes, you are eating too fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It takes about 20 minutes for the stomach to communicate to the brain via a whole host of hormonal signals that it’s full,” said Leslie Heinberg, at the Center for Behavioral Health at the Cleveland Clinic. “So when people eat rapidly, they can miss these signals and it’s very easy to eat beyond the point of fullness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Why is that a problem?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who eat quickly are likely to swallow more air, Heinberg said, which could lead to bloating or indigestion. Not chewing your food properly can also compromise digestion, meaning you won’t get all of the nutrients from your food. Unchewed pieces of food also could get stuck in your esophagus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some previous studies have suggested that people who eat quickly have the highest risk of &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/how-common-is-obesity-us-5663c0388b19009eae3834d695710bc4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, while the slowest eaters were the least likely to be obese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How can you slow down when eating?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, turn off the TV and put down your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’re eating while you watch TV, people tend to eat until there’s a commercial or the show is over,” Heinberg said, adding that people are less inclined to pay attention to the body’s own signals that it’s full. “When we do things while we’re eating, we’re eating less mindfully. And that often causes us to eat more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said that when people focus exclusively on eating, they tend to enjoy the meal more and eat less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heinberg also acknowledged the pace at which you eat is often an ingrained habit, but said change is still possible. She suggested things like using your non-dominant hand to eat, trying utensils you might not ordinarily use like chopsticks or taking a deliberate break to drink water when your plate is partially empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a busy life, it might be unavoidable to eat lunch at a work meeting or snack while running errands. But Sarah Berry, chief scientist at the British nutritional company ZOE, said when possible, “be mindful of what the food tastes and feels like.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we’re not fully present, it’s very easy to eat more quickly and not notice how much we’ve consumed,” Berry said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Chew your food, just like mom told you to&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the simplest things to do is to increase the number of bites you take, said Helen McCarthy, a clinical psychologist with the British Psychological Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you chew each mouthful a little bit longer, that will slow down your eating,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kind of food you eat may also make a difference, pointing out that it’s much easier to eat &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/ultraprocessed-foods-kennedy-f6a2607b14c4a2787c68801a8e0646bc" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ultraprocessed&lt;/a&gt; or fast foods quicker, because they typically have a softer texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to eat vegetables and protein at the same rate as something that’s highly processed and requires less chewing,” McCarthy said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of her patients also reported an unintentional side effect once they began eating more slowly, referencing one woman who often ate a tube of potato chips every evening. When McCarthy told her to slow down and eat every single chip individually, her patient told her “it was like having a mouthful of claggy chemicals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She didn’t find (the chips) enjoyable anymore,” McCarthy said.&lt;/p&gt;

The Oregon Veterinary Diagnostics Laboratory at Oregon State University confirmed the presence of RHDV on April 14, 2025. Most rabbits at the rabbitry have since died; the remaining rabbits are under quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The affected rabbits were housed outdoors where they may have potentially been exposed to wild rabbits. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) has not diagnosed RHDV in wild rabbits in Western Oregon, but the virus is known to be present in wild populations in Central and Eastern Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RHDV is a viral disease that causes sudden death in rabbits, ODA explains. Signs of the disease in rabbits may include respiratory or neurological symptoms and bloody nasal discharge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The virus is highly contagious among rabbit populations," ODA says. "It can spread through contact with infected rabbits, meat, fur, or materials coming into contact with them. RHDV poses no human health risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ODA says the virus only infects rabbits and does not pose a risk to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can I prevent the spread of RHDV?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wash and disinfect hands, clothing, gloves, footwear, cages, and equipment between rabbits from different sources.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quarantine new rabbits away from existing ones for 30 days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep pet rabbits inside to avoid exposure to environments potentially contaminated by wild or feral rabbits or by people, vehicles, or implements that can spread the disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immediately contact ODA (503-986-4711) if you suspect RHDV or have sick or freshly dead rabbits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ODA and ODFW ask the public to report rabbit mortalities to track the virus's presence and movement.

These microbial imbalances are associated with increased inflammation, leaky gut, and impaired gut-brain communication—all of which may exacerbate obstructive sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also discuss the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as possible messengers carrying microbial signals to the brain that affect sleep regulation. The findings support future research into microbiome-based therapies as a novel approach to managing sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microbiome Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Altered gut microbiota may worsen sleep apnea through inflammation and impaired gut-barrier function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gut–Brain Signals:&lt;/strong&gt; Extracellular vesicles could mediate communication between gut microbes and sleep-regulating brain regions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Improving gut health may offer new avenues for treating or mitigating sleep apnea symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Marshall University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new scientific review from researchers at the Marshall University Joan C.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It explores how gut microbiota—the diverse community of microorganisms living in the digestive tract—may influence the development and severity of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alterations in gut microbiota composition have been consistently observed in individuals with sleep apnea, and may induce “Leaky gut,” or impaired intestinal barrier integrity, that in turn promotes systemic inflammation that worsens sleep apnea symptoms and facilitates the emergence of end-organ injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recent studies suggest that changes in gut microbiota diversity and composition may play a role in the onset or progression of sleep apnea,” said Hicks, lead author on the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This connection may be mediated by impaired gut barrier function, inflammation, immune responses and gut-brain communication pathways.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review also highlights the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs)—tiny particles released by cells that carry molecular signals—as potential messengers between the gut and brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These EVs may affect sleep regulation by modulating immune responses or transporting microbial signals to the brain and could serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets in modulating the gut–brain axis in sleep apnea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors, which include David Gozal, M.D., M.B.A., Ph.D. (Hon); Sarfraz Ahmed, Ph,D.; and Abdelnaby Khalyfa, M.S., Ph.D., all of Marshall University, call for future longitudinal studies to better understand how gut microbiome changes over time may influence the development or consequences of sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also advocate for deeper investigation into the mechanisms by which microbial species and their metabolites affect sleep, and for development of new treatments aimed at improving gut health as a strategy for managing sleep apnea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is exciting to see medical students taking the lead in exploring complex and emerging areas like the gut–sleep connection,” said Khalyfa, professor of biomedical sciences at Marshall University, corresponding author on this study and Rebecca’s mentor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This kind of research not only advances our understanding of sleep apnea but also demonstrates the vital role early career trainees can play in shaping the future of medicine in general, and of sleep medicine in particular through innovation and collaboration.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep apnea and microbiome research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cebda3a7baa6fbf8f88ea3afbcbda6afa2a2e0abaabb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sheanna Spence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://marshall.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Marshall University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sheanna Spence – Marshall University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2025.106493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Interplay between gut microbiota and exosome dynamics in sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;” by Rebecca Hicks et al. &lt;em&gt;Sleep Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interplay between gut microbiota and exosome dynamics in sleep apnea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is characterized by recurrent reductions or interruptions in airflow during sleep, termed hypopneas and apneas, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SDB impairs sleep quality and is linked to substantive health issues including cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, as well as cognitive decline. Recent evidence suggests a link between gut microbiota (GM) composition and sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, GM, a community of microorganisms residing in the gut, has emerged as a potential player in various diseases, and several studies have identified associations between sleep apnea and GM diversity along with shifts in bacterial populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the concept of “leaky gut,” a compromised intestinal barrier with potentially increased inflammation, has emerged as another key player in the potential bidirectional relationship between GM and sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the potential effectors could be extracellular vesicles (EVs) underlying gut-brain communication pathways that are relevant to sleep regulation and function. Thus, therapeutic implications afforded by targeting the GM or exosomes for sleep apnea management have surfaced as promising areas of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This review explores current understanding of the relationship between GM, exosomes and sleep apnea, highlighting key research dynamics and potential mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted, focusing on studies investigating GM composition, intestinal barrier function and gut-brain communication in relation to sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:16:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBWYnFCcVFQVWhsSWcyWkJTQ2JCeGpFZnk4ZXlZZWRSMjdaWHVWRXhQbDg1Q0psTk5wazQ3c3B6TFV0LXh0OWg0VW9JbXlfYktGc0d0Z3hBR2JsRDlZUy1fcVZ0Vk1SSDd1WHd6eGp6MA</guid></item><item><title>致命病毒在道格拉斯县（ KTVZ ）的家兔种群中得到确认 | Deadly virus confirmed in domestic rabbit population in Douglas County - KTVZ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxQTm1MeFAtWlFQd2h3eE04Um1PbTNFOVR1Vm02SmpZRWYwbjE0cFpyMkpVeTRiX1ZOUzctckJrRlVIQ3FmTmdRanRKblYzbV9FSXNJT0lJbmxVRVFrXzJFMTlaNUZleGgwUGlpWS05bl85WEpBemM2N2pxaVRObzNaX0pMaktwb29IZ0NmSzMyX3daU2hXcUpHQWhHWVNOUTJPdFFKWU5Ddkx2LWYza2NsSkxGYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="post-1518173" class="panel-group post-1518173 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-government-politics category-health category-news category-oregon-northwest category-pets category-top-stories category-wildlife"&gt;
    

    
 

    

           

	&lt;div class="entry__content"&gt;
        
&lt;p&gt;SALEM, Ore. (KTVZ) -- The Oregon Department of Agriculture said Wednesday it has confirmed Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease (RHDV) in domestic rabbits in a Douglas County rabbitry. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rabbit's owner noted sudden rabbit deaths, reporting the symptoms to their veterinarian late last week. The veterinarian suspected RHDV and immediately reported it to ODA. The Oregon Veterinary Diagnostics Laboratory at Oregon State University confirmed the presence of RHDV on Monday. Most rabbits at the rabbitry have since died; the remaining rabbits are under quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The affected rabbits were housed outdoors, where they may have potentially been exposed to wild rabbits. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has not diagnosed RHDV in wild rabbits in Western Oregon, but the virus is known to be present in wild populations in Central and Eastern Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RHDV is a viral disease that causes sudden death in rabbits. Signs of the disease in rabbits may include respiratory or neurological symptoms and bloody nasal discharge.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The virus is highly contagious among rabbit populations. It can spread through contact with infected rabbits, meat, fur, or materials coming into contact with them. RHDV poses no human health risk. The virus only infects rabbits and does not pose a risk to humans.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I prevent the spread of RHDV?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wash and disinfect hands, clothing, gloves, footwear, cages, and equipment between rabbits from different sources.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Quarantine new rabbits away from existing ones for 30 days.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Keep pet rabbits inside to avoid exposure to environments potentially contaminated by wild or feral rabbits or by people, vehicles, or implements that can spread the disease.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Immediately contact ODA (503-986-4711) if you suspect RHDV or have sick or freshly dead rabbits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ODA and ODFW ask the public to report rabbit mortalities to track the virus's presence and movement. Please call 503-986-4711 to report domestic or feral (domestic animals that escaped into the wild or were abandoned)rabbits suspected of having died from RHDV. To report the death of wild rabbits, contact ODFW by calling 1-866-968-2600 or email &lt;a href="mailto:Wildlife.Health@odfw.oregon.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wildlife.Health@odfw.oregon.gov&lt;/a&gt;. Visit &lt;a href="https://oda.direct/RHD?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;https://oda.direct/RHD&lt;/a&gt; for more information about Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency says domestic rabbit owners should contact their veterinarian for more information on preventing RHDV. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rice, the world’s most consumed grain, will become increasingly toxic as the atmosphere heats and as carbon dioxide emissions rise, potentially putting billions of people at risk of cancers and other diseases, according to &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(25)00055-5/fulltext"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday in The Lancet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eaten every day by billions of people and grown across the globe, rice is arguably the planet’s most important staple crop, with half the &lt;a href="https://www.fao.org/4/y4347e/y4347e01.htm#:~:text=Over%2050%20percent%20of%20the,and%20consumed%20in%20developing%20countries."&gt;world’s population&lt;/a&gt; relying on it for the majority of its food needs, especially in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the way rice is grown—mostly submerged in paddies—and its highly porous texture means it can absorb unusually high levels of arsenic, a potent carcinogenic toxin that is especially dangerous for babies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="icn-call-out-block"&gt;&lt;h3 class="block-title"&gt;We’re hiring!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/about/jobs/" class="button button-green" target="_blank"&gt;See jobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 


&lt;p&gt;Lewis Ziska, a plant physiologist and associate professor at Columbia University, has studied rice for three decades and has more recently focused his research on how climate change reduces nutrient levels across many staple crops, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaq1012"&gt;including rice&lt;/a&gt;. He teamed up with researchers from China and the U.S. to conduct a first-of-its-kind study, looking at how a range of rice species reacted to increases in temperature and carbon dioxide, both of which are projected to occur as more greenhouse gas emissions are released into the atmosphere as a result of human activities. The new study was published in The Lancet Planetary Health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Previous work has focused on individual responses—some on CO2 and some on temperature, but not both, and not on a wide range of rice genetics,” Ziska said. “We knew that temperature by itself could increase levels, and carbon dioxide by a little bit. But when we put both of them together, then wow, that was really something we were not expecting. You’re looking at a crop staple that’s consumed by a billion people every day, and any effect on toxicity is going to have a pretty damn large effect.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For six years, Ziska and a large team of research colleagues in China and the U.S. grew rice in controlled fields, subjecting it to varying levels of carbon dioxide and temperature. They found that when both increased, in line with projections by climate scientists, the amount of arsenic and inorganic arsenic in rice grains also went up.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Arsenic is found naturally in some foods, including fish and shellfish, and in waters and soils.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Inorganic arsenic is found in industrial materials and gets into water—including water used to submerge rice paddies.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rice is easily inundated with weeds and other crops, but it has one advantage: It grows well in water. So farmers germinate the seeds, and when the seedlings are ready, plant them in wet soil. They then flood their fields, which suppresses weeds, but allows the rice to flourish. Rice readily absorbs the water and everything in it—including arsenic, either naturally occurring or not. Most of the world’s rice is grown this way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new research demonstrates that climate change will ramp up those levels. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What happens in rice, because of complex biogeochemical processes in the soil, when temperatures and CO2 go up, inorganic arsenic also does,” Ziska said. “And it’s this inorganic arsenic that poses the greatest health risk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Exposure to inorganic arsenic has been linked to cancers of the skin, bladder and lung, heart disease and neurological problems in infants. Research has found that in parts of the world with high consumption of rice, inorganic arsenic increases cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ziska and his colleagues took the data from their field trials and then, based on per capita consumption data in seven of the top rice-consuming countries in Asia, projected how disease risk could also increase. They found that in those seven countries—Vietnam, Indonesia, China, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Myanmar and India—disease risk rose across the board.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There is a toxicological effect of climate change relative to one of the most consumed staples in the world,” Ziska said, “and the consumption is one of the hallmarks of whether you’re going to be vulnerable to that effect.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have known that rice can contain high levels of arsenic and regulators have suggested exposure limits, especially for infants who are particularly vulnerable and tend to eat a lot of rice. This new research should put extra pressure on regulators to set more stringent thresholds, the authors say. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has never set limits for arsenic in foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also point to the potential of various interventions that could limit exposure to inorganic arsenic from rice, including developing strains of rice that are less absorbent and educating consumers about alternatives to rice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Rice has always been a food where arsenic is an issue, and climate change is making it worse,” said Keeve Nachman, one of the report’s authors, a professor at Johns Hopkins University and a longtime researcher of health risks related to food production and consumption. “This is one more reason to intervene—to control people’s exposure. The number one thing we can do is everything in our power to slow climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to recommend that any RSV vaccine for adults that is licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for high-risk adults aged 50 to 59 be recommended for use in that age group. If the recommendation is accepted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — which the ACIP advises — insurance companies will have to cover the cost of the vaccine for eligible individuals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How quickly that might happen is unclear. ACIP recommendations must be approved by the director of the CDC, and at present, the agency does not have a director. Susan Monarez, who had been serving as acting director until she was proposed as &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/24/susan-monarez-trump-pick-cdc/"&gt;the nominee for the position&lt;/a&gt;, has not yet been through the Senate confirmation process. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson said the CDC’s chief of staff Matthew Buzzelli would take receipt of the six recommendations from the committee that arose from Wednesday’s meeting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Faust, a Boston emergency room physician and public health expert who writes the &lt;a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/scoop-cdc-has-no-acting-director" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Substack column Inside Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, reported last week that legal experts say that in the absence of a CDC director, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could sign off on the committee’s recommendations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In addition to the RSV vaccine vote, the committee also recommended use of a new meningococcal vaccine from GSK, a chikungunya vaccine from Bavarian Nordic, and voted to tweak a previous recommendation for another chikungunya vaccine, made by Valneva. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If accepted by the CDC, the vote on the use of RSV vaccines in people in their 50s would initially apply to vaccines sold by GSK and Pfizer. Moderna is in the process of applying to the FDA to extend the license for its RSV vaccine to include high-risk people aged 50 to 59, and the new policy — if approved — would cover it as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A cost analysis generated by the CDC and researchers from the University of Michigan suggested that use of these expensive vaccines in selected members of this age demographic could be cost saving. In particular, it was suggested that people who have undergone lung transplantation, or who have heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, or severe obesity should be considered for RSV vaccination in their 50s. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Michael Melgar, a CDC vaccines researcher, said around 30% of U.S. adults aged 50 to 59 would qualify.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The present CDC recommendation for use of these vaccines in older adults is that anyone aged 75 and older should get the shot and anyone aged 60 to 74 who is at high risk of severe illness from RSV should too. The ACIP has been slow to recommend broader use of RSV vaccines for older adults because of a couple of concerns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two of the vaccines — the Pfizer and GSK products — appear to be linked to an &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/02/29/rsv-vaccines-may-be-linked-to-small-increased-risk-of-developing-guillain-barre-syndrome/"&gt;elevated risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. (There have been no reports of GBS among people who received the Moderna vaccine.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another concern relates to the fact that it is still not known how often these vaccines will need to be given, and whether getting an additional dose at some later date will adequately boost protection. The data to date suggest that while additional doses do lead to an increase in antibodies, antibody levels do not return to the levels seen after a first shot with these vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At present the recommendation for RSV vaccines is that they are a one-time shot, though it is widely expected that at some point there will be a recommendation for additional shots later. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The committee also voted to recommend use of a new chikungunya vaccine, Vimkunya, for travelers and scientists who work on the chikungunya virus in laboratories. The vaccine, made by Bavarian Nordic, is licensed for use in people aged 12 and older.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya infection, which is triggered by the bite of an infected mosquito, causes fever, and muscle and joint pain that can be severe, and in some cases long lasting. Transmission has been recorded in about 120 countries globally, though the disease occurs in outbreaks that are unpredictable in their frequency. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The recommendation is that the vaccine can be used in people who are traveling to a country where an outbreak is underway. The committee further recommended that use of the vaccine could be considered in people who are traveling to a place where the risk of transmission is elevated, if the person will be staying in the location for a period of six months or longer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The committee previously had recommended use of another chikungunya vaccine, made by Valneva. The earlier recommendation had stressed use in people 65 and older, who are at increased risk of having serious illness if they contract the virus. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But six reports of serious side-effects in older adults after vaccination — five of which required hospitalization — prompted the committee to amend that recommendation on Wednesday. While it did not recommend against use of the Valneva  in people 65 and older, the recommendation — if accepted, will feature a precaution about use of the vaccine in that age group. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The committee also recommended use of GSK’s pentavalent — five in one — vaccine to protect against meningitis, MenABCWY, for people aged 16 to 23 for whom a vaccine protecting against meningitis B is recommended, and for people aged 10 and older at increased risk of developing meningococcal disease because of underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Despite concerns that the administration might meddle with a committee of vaccine advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, their first public meeting since President Trump's inauguration followed its usual course. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to expand the options for meningococcal vaccines and to lower the age of recommendation for RSV vaccines to include people aged 50 to 59 with certain risk factors. They also voted to recommend vaccines for the tropical disease chikungunya for travelers or lab workers who are likely to be exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;These recommendations go to the CDC director, who usually heeds them but ultimately determines whether or not they become policy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Committee members also previewed topics such as flu and COVID vaccines that will be considered more formally in the next public meeting, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;scheduled for June&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A rescheduled meeting raises concerns &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over two days, members sat through detailed presentations on data and modeling for a range of vaccines – from mpox to flu, COVID and chikungunya – and asked questions to sharpen their assessments of the risks and benefits of different vaccines. The meeting got weedy at times, as the presenters and committee members dug into technical details, which is typical.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The committee had been scheduled to meet in February, but the event was postponed shortly after the confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees CDC. The postponement heightened concerns about possible interference.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I am encouraged that the proceedings of ACIP have resumed, giving the American public a window into the future of our nation's vaccine policy in a time of great uncertainty,"  Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester, a Democrat from Delaware, said in an emailed statement. "As America faces measles outbreaks and a changing political landscape, the public deserves transparency."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In watching the meeting, Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist and data scientist, said, "It seems pretty much business as usual – and it's sad that that is newsworthy.," She writes the newsletter "Your Local Epidemiologist."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, Jetelina said, there were nuances that reflect changes made by the Trump administration over the past few months. Trump's team has made deep cuts to funding and resources for public health. The administratione also elevated individuals who have long questioned the safety and efficacy of vaccines, despite strong evidence supporting them, into positions of influence over research and policy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Resource cuts were evident&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some effects were evident from the start. Technical issues plagued the beginning of the meeting and required a fresh link to the public livestream. "As you may have noticed, there have been some changes with the recent reductions in force, including our communications group, so I ask that you please be patient with us," said &lt;a href="https://wag.app.vanderbilt.edu/PublicPage/Faculty/Details/32055" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Keipp Talbot,&lt;/a&gt; professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University and chair of the committee.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The resource cuts were top of mind for some committee members. Charlotte Moser, co-director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, probed for declines in CDC's ability to evaluate how safe vaccines are, and how well they work.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Are all of those [data collection systems] still funded to actively collect data through this season and then in anticipation of next season?" Moser asked, after a presentation on the efficacy of the 2024-2025 flu vaccine. In response, CDC epidemiologist Sascha Ellington said three of four flu vaccine surveillance networks would continue operating and that one would be shut down.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Funding cuts are also affecting the response to the ongoing measles outbreak in Texas, according to a CDC presentation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The outbreak started in late January and has grown to more than 600 cases across Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. "There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas," said Dr. David Sugerman, a senior scientist at CDC working on its measles response. The state recently lost several hundred million dollars in public health funding, in a federal clawback of COVID funds that began late last month. "The estimates are that each measles case can be $30,000-$50,000 for public health response work, and that adds up quite quickly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Committee member Dr. Jane Zucker, adjunct professor in the Department of Community Health Sciences at SUNY Downstate School of Public Health, had worked on containing a New York City measles outbreak in 2018. She said that the outbreak, which had around 650 confirmed cases, cost &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514" target="_blank"&gt;more than $8 million&lt;/a&gt; to bring under control.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A new FDA representative raises safety questions&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition to the official committee members, the meeting is attended by members from U.S. health agencies and professional medical groups.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For this meeting, the Food and Drug Administration was represented by Dr. Tracy Beth Høeg, a special assistant to the commissioner, who has criticized CDC for recommending &lt;a href="https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Testimony-3-27-2023-TracyBethHoegFINALv2.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;school closures during COVID&lt;/a&gt;. She took the liaison seat previously occupied by Dr. Peter Marks, the top vaccine regulator at FDA who was &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/28/nx-s1-5344010/fda-peter-marks-rfk-jr" target="_blank"&gt;forced to resign in March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Høeg has questioned vaccine safety, and she raised concerns in this week's meeting. Following a presentation on a study of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-04-15-16/02-Creech-Mpox-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;mpox vaccine in teens&lt;/a&gt;, Høeg said: "They excluded adolescents with underlying significant heart conditions and significant medical conditions. So I think it's important for providers to keep in mind that … we don't really know about the safety in those adolescents."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Høeg asked about "bias in our estimates" in a presentation on influenza vaccine efficacy, arguing that vaccinated people may be overrepresented because they may be more likely to seek out testing. CDC staff responded that their studies are designed to account for these and other types of bias. "We're confident that [the impact of bias] is minimal and that the estimates are accurate," said Dr. Aaron Frutos, an epidemiologist with CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Public comment in support of committee&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When HHS postponed the meeting in February, the reason was "to accommodate public comment in advance of the meeting," according to an HHS spokesperson at the time.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Those who were chosen by lottery to speak during the public comment period for this meeting praised the committee's work. "They play a really crucial role in ensuring that vaccine recommendations are based on available evidence and are reviewed rigorously by scientists who are qualified to do so," said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan and co-editor in chief of the journal &lt;em&gt;Vaccine&lt;/em&gt;. "It is essential for public trust and accountability that this occurs in a transparent and inclusive way that the public can observe and participate in."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Avoiding this deadly mismatch of supply and demand is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Any major disruptions to the availability and safety of the blood supply puts lives at risk,” said Elvina Viennet, an infectious disease researcher at the University of the Sunshine Coast in Australia and one of the lead authors of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It is the first global assessment of how climate change affects blood supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Dr. Viennet and her collaborators reviewed dozens of studies on how extreme weather events, which are increasing around the world because of climate change, affect physical and mental well-being, the spread of infectious diseases, the safety of blood transfusions and other aspects of public health.

A single dose provides protection for six months, &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/newsroom/news/2025/04/wesley-sundquist-named-times-annual-time100-list-of-100-most-influential"&gt;according to a University of Utah Health release.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Sundquist consulted with Gilead Sciences, which developed lenacapavir. His collaborator at Gilead, Tomas Cihlar, is a co-recipient of TIME’s “influential” honor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Time 100 list, which is slated for the April 28, 2025 issue, includes Sundquist and Cihlar in the list’s “Pioneers” category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://urlisolation.com/browser?clickId=5002F7B7-BAB2-41CA-95D1-6DBCA5C89A11&amp;amp;traceToken=1744830444%3Bgilead_hosted%3Bhttp%3A%2Ftime.com%2Ftime100&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Fcollections%2F100-most-influential-people-2025%2F7273749%2Ftomas-cihlar-and-wesley-sundquist%2F"&gt;The magazine’s short essay on the two men&lt;/a&gt; noted that today’s antiviral medications can turn HIV, a once fatal disease, into a chronic condition. However, the cocktail of pills remains inaccessible for many — and lapses in the daily regimen make them less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Sundquist and Cihlar, the essay adds, “have labored for more than a dozen years to turn one antiviral treatment, lenacapavir, into a twice-a-year therapy to prevent HIV infection in those at high risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Sundquist, according to the magazine, laid the groundwork in studying one of HIV’s proteins, the capsid, which creates a protective shell around the virus’ genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Cihlar visited his labs and was impressed enough to take his discoveries to Gilead. There, his team found ways to extend the effect of the drug over six months, meaning infected patients only receive two injections a year to treat HIV.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Time essay concludes saying researchers are now studying lenacapavir in people who are not HIV positive but are at high risk of exposure. “If approved, it would be the first twice-a-year injected drug to prevent HIV. Early results show great promise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In multiple clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people, lenacapavir has shown 99.9 to 100 percent efficacy in preventing HIV — results that Sundquist describes as “spectacularly successful”, &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/newsroom/news/2025/04/wesley-sundquist-named-times-annual-time100-list-of-100-most-influential"&gt;according to the university release.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;If distributed broadly, the drug reportedly has the potential to dramatically decrease infection rates worldwide. “It feels like our work has made a difference,” Sundquist adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The scientist told the Deseret News on Wednesday that his “real excitement” is found in the drug’s potential in protecting against new infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Worldwide, there are still 1.3 million new infections ever year,” he said. “This has the promise to help prevent that and really change the course of the pandemic, especially in the developing world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Curiosity-driven-medical-research" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Curiosity-driven medical research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Lenacapavir’s story began decades ago “with basic, curiosity-driven research in Sundquist’s lab,” according to the university.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The lab wasn’t specifically aiming to discover new therapies — they were simply trying to understand &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/newsroom/news/2024/12/hiv-drug-based-research-sundquist-lab-sciences-2024-breakthrough-of-year"&gt;how the HIV virus particle is put together.&lt;/a&gt; They discovered that one of the key components of the virus is extremely sensitive to change: a prime target for drug development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Today, we recognize Dr. Sundquist for his work that began more than 20 years ago as a quest to understand the structure of HIV and has now led to a medication that could prevent the spread of HIV worldwide,” says Dr. Rachel Hess, Associate Vice President for Research at University of Utah Health in the university release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“This is an amazing example of fundamental research creating the environment to improve health around the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Added Dr. Bob Carter, CEO for University of Utah Health and Senior Vice President for Health Sciences: “We’re honored that the global impact of his work has been recognized and incredibly proud that his work continues at U of U Health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="A-plea-for-medical-research-support" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;A plea for medical research support&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Next week, Sundquist and fellow Time “influencers” will be honored at New York’s Lincoln Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“It’s supposed to be a black tie, red carpet kind of thing, which is not my style,” he said, laughing. “But I think it’ll be a lot of fun.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;On a serious note, Sundquist hopes the Time magazine honor brings attention to &lt;a href="https://www.deseret.com/utah/2025/02/11/university-utah-nih-grants-medical-research-trump-indirect-overhead/" target="_blank"&gt;the importance of continued medical research support and funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We’re a basic research lab, and as you may know, that’s under considerable turmoil right now,” he said. “So labs like mine function because we have sustained support from the NIH.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Delivering to patients the sorts of drugs that Sundquist and his colleagues have worked decades to develop requires resources. “And that’s also under threat right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The scientist added he is a supporter of “basic research”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We never know how it’s going to result in important advances, but inevitably, across the field and across time, it does result in important advances,” said Sundquist. “If we support it, it has a very strong track record — and if we don’t, we’ll (risk) losing our feedstocks for new ideas in medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 22:02:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQU2dEN0diMjlwMnN6VzZKSmZGd1kwTHhKMDRrR1dMRG9jOGU0ZDFlUkZqUVpMZjZFN2JuVHhsd0dGTUdJcnYxdllqODRuaGY0UExfNUZIUC00SWpmUkZ6S05HQUhqUHlPX3ZrdnZGV0JGbnVab0dUdHJsWHB2OWJhUDhCWlBvYjNPLXY1X2toYmRndTVHU2J4Q3dVSQ</guid></item><item><title>与癌症相关的医学检测，加上链球菌性咽喉炎病例上升-福克斯新闻 | Medical test linked to cancer, plus rising strep throat cases -

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading cancers worldwide, especially in countries that follow a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/food-to-limit-to-reduce-colon-cancer-risk-11694207" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Western lifestyle and diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Worldwide, 1.2 million new CRC cases are diagnosed each year, making it the second most common cancer in men and the third most common in women. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In the U.S., colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in American men and women, excluding skin cancers. The lifetime risk for developing CRC is about one in 24 for men and one in 26 for women, depending on risk factors.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Scientists are always looking for ways to reduce the risk of diseases like CRC, which includes cancers of the colon and rectum. In a review of previously published studies, researchers focused on the relationship between vitamin D and CRC. They published the review in April 2025 in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down their findings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study was a review, meaning that the researchers assessed a variety of previous studies to look for overarching connections the results shared.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers searched scientific databases for studies on CRC and vitamin D. While they initially found over 10,000 studies, they ended up with 50 after sifting through them and removing duplicates and those that didn’t meet their criteria. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Specifically, the researchers only wanted to include studies in adult human participants who either had CRC (or precursors for CRC) or had a documented vitamin D deficiency. They also sought out cases where participants were given a vitamin D supplement as part of the study.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to these researchers, vitamin D has been shown to have many benefits in our bodies, including supporting communication between nerve cells, regulating blood pressure and preventing respiratory infections. It plays roles in maintaining gut health, thyroid hormone levels, blood sugar levels and even mitigating the harmful effects of aging. Vitamin D also acts as an antioxidant, reducing inflammation, suppressing autoimmune responses and supporting the function of immune cells.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers also cite a previous study that suggests that vitamin D inhibits uncontrolled cell growth and the formation of new blood vessels that “feed” cancer cells (called angiogenesis) and promotes apoptosis (killing abnormal cells).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So what did these researchers find regarding vitamin D and CRC? While there was some conflicting evidence, they state that vitamin D deficiency is strongly linked to an increased risk of CRC, partly because that deficiency exacerbates intestinal inflammation, which promotes CRC progression.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Specifically, one meta-analysis of 31 original studies reported that compared to the lowest dietary intake of vitamin D (10 ng/mL), the highest amount (80 ng/mL) showed a 25% reduction in CRC risk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Nurses’ Health Study, a common long-term U.S. study used to find connections between lifestyle factors and disease risk, showed that women with the highest vitamin D intake had a 58% reduced risk of CRC compared to those with the lowest intake. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Iowa Women’s Health Study found that those in the highest calcium and vitamin D intake reduced their risk of CRC by about half. The Spanish PREDIMED study had similar results, as did studies that used vitamin D supplementation (as opposed to getting it through food). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Polyps and adenomas are precursors to CRC and are commonly found and removed during colonoscopies. Researchers found evidence that vitamin D can also help prevent polyps. For example, a Canadian study with 1,409 participants found that vitamin D supplementation reduced the probability of polyp development by 33% and the risk of high-risk adenomatous polyps by 43%. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, researchers found that vitamin D, both dietary and supplemented, plays a crucial role in preventing and treating colorectal cancer by reducing inflammation, regulating immune responses, promoting cancer cell death and inhibiting tumor growth. For those who have CRC, vitamin D may help promote better survival rates and reduce death rates from CRC. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There were a few limitations to this review. First, though many studies showed protective benefits of vitamin D on CRC, most could not define the mechanisms through which these benefits occurred. Study authors also state that more large-scale, randomized clinical trials need to be done, which will provide more answers, including optimal dosage and formulations of vitamin D supplements. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Based on the evidence in this review, vitamin D appears to help prevent CRC and may help people with CRC survive it. Unfortunately, vitamin D is a commonly deficient vitamin. Worldwide, vitamin D deficiency is estimated to range from 30% to 50%, with even higher rates seen in specific populations.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/conditions-when-you-need-vitamin-d-supplement-8576496" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency&lt;/a&gt; include being a woman, living in regions that experience colder winter climates, having darker skin and living in a low- and middle-income country where proper nutrition and supplements may be more limited. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides having a genetic predisposition for CRC, other risk factors include older age, sedentary lifestyle and a diet high in unhealthy fats and red meat and low in fiber. An imbalanced gut microbiome also plays a role, as do having inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, frailty and diabetes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D is called the sunshine vitamin because your body manufactures it with UVB rays exposure—aka sunshine. But if you live in regions that experience cold winters, it can be difficult or impossible to get enough sun exposure during those months. In the warmer months, you should consider your skin cancer risk and balance it with sun exposure. You also need to have enough skin exposure to make vitamin D—face, arms and legs. Plus, pollution, darker skin and possibly sunscreen reduce sunlight absorption, reducing vitamin D production. For these reasons, diet and supplementation may be more reliable avenues for getting enough vitamin D. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because it is possible to overdo it and end up with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-vitamin-d-per-day-is-too-much-8605769" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D toxicity&lt;/a&gt;, before you start putting the vitamin D supplements to use, it helps to know your blood levels. This can be done by requesting a blood test from your primary care practitioner. If you end up being deficient, meeting with a registered dietitian can help you figure out what foods and how much of each you need to eat each day to get your levels up. An RD can also help you supplement, if that is your desire or if it’s recommended. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another finding from this review was that healthy eating patterns, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2058981/ultimate-mediterranean-diet-shopping-list/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, tend to be plentiful in vitamin D and other anti-inflammatory nutrients. The Mediterranean diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, fish, dairy and healthy fats. While there aren’t a lot of food sources of vitamin D, ones that contain it include egg yolks, fatty fish (like salmon, tuna, mackerel and sardines) and mushrooms. Fortified dairy and orange juice also contain vitamin D. Researchers note that a holistic dietary approach may be a better strategy than focusing on one isolated nutrient. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This review of 50 studies found a strong connection between adequate vitamin D levels and a reduced risk of colorectal cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Because vitamin D deficiency is so common, it can be helpful to have bloodwork to test your levels. Based on the results, if you need to increase your levels, try adding foods rich in vitamin D, including whole eggs, salmon, mushrooms and fortified dairy products, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/yogurt-colorectal-cancer-study-11682870" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;like milk and yogurt&lt;/a&gt;, to your diet. Following a healthy eating pattern, like the Mediterranean diet, can also be beneficial.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you choose to supplement, work with a registered dietitian or your primary care practitioner to determine the best dose for you. When possible, spend time outside to catch some rays. Being outdoors also has &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291942/exactly-how-much-nature-time-you-need-to-reap-the-physical-and-mental-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mental health and mood benefits&lt;/a&gt;—all the better if your physical activity is performed outside.&lt;br&gt;

Researchers found that music-induced “chills” are linked to the release of natural opioids in key brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants with higher opioid receptor density showed stronger brain responses to music, highlighting individual differences in musical enjoyment. These findings explain why music can evoke powerful emotional reactions and suggest potential applications in pain therapy and mental health treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opioid Release:&lt;/strong&gt; Favorite music triggered the release of opioids in brain regions tied to pleasure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual Variation:&lt;/strong&gt; People with more opioid receptors had stronger brain responses to music.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Music-induced opioid activity may help explain music’s pain-relieving effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Turku&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new imaging study by the Turku PET Centre in Finland showed that listening to favorite music affects the function of the brain’s opioid system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music can evoke intense pleasure, sometimes experienced physically as pleasant “chills.” While the effect of music on pleasure is clear, the brain mechanisms behind musical enjoyment are not yet fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108830"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince.jpg" alt="This shows a woman in headphones and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/music-opioid-system-neurosceince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results show that favorite music influenced opioid release in several brain areas associated with the experience of pleasure. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain’s opioid system is known to be involved in pleasurable experiences related to survival-critical behaviors, such as eating and sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new study from the Turku PET Centre in Finland demonstrates for the first time that listening to favorite music also activates the brain’s opioid receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study measured the release of opioids in the brain using positron emission tomography (PET) while participants listened to their favorite music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine how the density of opioid receptors affects brain activation when listening to music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show that favorite music influenced opioid release in several brain areas associated with the experience of pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release of opioids was also linked to how often participants reported &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/music-chills-neuroscience-6167/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;experiencing pleasurable chills&lt;/a&gt; while listening to music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, individual differences in the number of opioid receptors correlated with brain activation during music listening: the more opioid receptors participants had, the more strongly their brains reacted in MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results show for the first time directly that listening to music activates the brain’s opioid system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The release of opioids explains why music can produce such strong feelings of pleasure, even though it is not a primary reward necessary for survival or reproduction, like food or sexual pleasure,” says Academy Research Fellow Vesa Putkinen from the University of Turku.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Lauri Nummenmaa adds: “The brain’s opioid system is also involved in pain relief. Based on our findings, the previously observed pain-relieving effects of music may be due to music-induced opioid responses in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study provides significant new insight into how the brain’s chemical systems regulate the pleasure derived from music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results may also help develop new music-based interventions, for example, in pain management and the treatment of mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this music and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#75161a1818001b1c1614011c1a1b06350001005b131c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tuomas Koivula&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://utu.fi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Turku&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Tuomas Koivula – University of Turku&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00259-025-07232-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pleasurable music activates cerebral µ-opioid receptors: a combined PET-fMRI study&lt;/a&gt;” by Vesa Putkinen et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;European Journal of Nuclear Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pleasurable music activates cerebral µ-opioid receptors: a combined PET-fMRI study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The μ-opioid receptor (MOR) system mediates incentive motivation and the hedonic component of primary rewards such as food and sex. However, there is no direct in vivo evidence for the involvement of the MOR system in pleasure derived from aesthetic rewards such as music. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We measured MOR availability with positron emission tomography (PET) and the agonist radioligand [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carfentanil with high affinity for MORs during the listening of pleasurable music and neutral baseline condition. Haemodynamic responses associated with dynamic pleasure ratings during listening to music and control stimuli were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PET results revealed that pleasurable music increased [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carfentanil binding in several cortical and subcortical regions, including ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex, known to contain “hedonic hotspots”. [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carfentanil binding in the nucleus accumbens during the music condition was associated with number of pleasurable chills, linking the subjective experience of pleasure to striatal opioid release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual variation in baseline MOR tone influenced pleasure-dependent haemodynamic responses during music listening in regions associated with interoceptive, sensorimotor, and reward processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings provide the first neuroimaging evidence that pleasurable music modulates MOR system function. The results indicate that the μ-opioid system governs complex aesthetic rewards in addition to biologically essential primary rewards.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 21:39:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE5ueUZJcE8zbkpIN2VNdFdMbDhLY1NxWUR2dGlQdmY3ci05blI5SWdyMHlpMWhCcHZ1bU9aUXByTkxxZTYtVXM2d1NKME9Xd1FsbFQxUFI3UUNkb01ZV0d0QVVROExaVHFmOVZoREtCdUtMenZFLXBXeQ</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心科学家：德克萨斯州麻疹疫情应对因资金削减而受损-《华盛顿邮报》 | CDC scientist: Texas measles outbreak response hurt by funding cuts - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxNQndOUU9WSXc0MTBxLWRBVUJFelVsWkNjVDU4bTEydzgtVWdNcmNSc3hUZmZKa2NkOHc4Q2dwRTRXQnVVdFVraXlrRXlEZkEtM0RzS1ppYl9IalIwUUdIMnFRUnBDdUNNUl96QURPQnBXVEt0OVJMcDd1U2JUSXBWZ3VzQW80UV9RRERETTZ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CJUOBZ2YKRFEJM4H5OHMPEF4B4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A senior scientist overseeing the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/03/24/measles-vaccine-booster-outbreak-states/" target="_blank"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; response by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a recent pullback of pandemic funding from states has hurt Texas’s response to its growing outbreak, now linked to 90 percent of cases in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MAOORTXVORDBNHTFGKHUYJ6IP4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas,” David Sugerman, a senior CDC scientist, said during a meeting of the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-meeting-postponed/" target="_blank"&gt;CDC’s vaccine advisory panel.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2HSRUD4MVNHORIUBM5APQNRZFM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“There are funding limitations in light of covid-19 funding dissipating,” Sugerman said&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Tuesday, referring to&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/25/trump-presidency-news/#link-ROZTVMB7WVHMDKXQN4NW5YJQDI" target="_blank"&gt; $11.4 billion in coronavirus-related funds&lt;/a&gt; that the Department of Health and Human Services ordered pulled back from state and local health departments and community organizations late last month.

Texas reported its first cases in late January. There has been no media briefing on the outbreak by the CDC or HHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XUXKTTIFMBAARFUDSRYNBQROHI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;More than 700 measles cases have been reported in 25 states this year. Most of the cases are in Texas (561) and New Mexico (63). Increasing numbers are being reported in Kansas and Oklahoma, state health department data shows. Genetic sequencing suggests that the outbreak in the Southwest is also linked to outbreaks in Canada and Mexico, Sugerman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UYUZP5H2DNA2DCBC2KQANGTF3I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Texas is pulling resources and staff members from other parts of its health department to respond to the outbreak, he said. The CDC is now “scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions,” Sugerman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="S5KCEFWFXFE6BLPDSHI2QUA7EA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Sugerman told the panel that the CDC had deployed 15 people to Texas to provide assistance from March 4 through April 1. Two of those staff members were among those laid off at CDC as part of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/01/hhs-senior-leaders-put-on-leave-nih/" target="_blank"&gt;widespread job cuts&lt;/a&gt; across the federal health agencies ordered by HHS, according to multiple federal health officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Sugerman said the CDC was sending a second team Tuesday to help with the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RIANVDOCCNH2VFNRFOV2LKHODY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Over 90 percent of the current national cases are related to the Southwest outbreak, driven by transmission in close-knit, undervaccinated communities with low vaccine coverage,” Sugerman said. The outbreak is centered in a local Mennonite community in Gaines County, in West Texas. Cases in Mexico and Canada have also been reported in local Mennonite communities, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7FRDR44O4ZDYBKXMSEIPHI3VJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Three deaths have been reported in this outbreak, two in unvaccinated, otherwise healthy school-age children in Texas, and one in an unvaccinated adult from New Mexico who tested positive for measles.

It cost the city health department about $8.4 million, and at the peak of the outbreak, the health department had 261 people deployed as part of its response, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="25KDTNUAVVAIVMLT6AY6SRTJPM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The response in New York “was an incredible feat and something we’re obviously trying to emulate here,” Sugerman told her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FXBO4KMBOZCBPO5MKGA7SYPH4Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We are trying to support where we can,” Sugerman said, adding that the outbreak response will be ongoing and will require significant financial resources. The public health response work for each measles case is estimated to cost $30,000 to $50,000, he said, and “that adds up quite quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EUHUR4WK4BDGTPXXWF6AWAC4RQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The CDC has provided infection prevention control systems to seven hospitals and reviewed school infection control strategies, he said.

			&lt;p&gt;In 2024, after 60 years of searching, geneticists finally identified the gene behind the marmalade coloration in domestic cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two independent teams of researchers found any fiery-hued fuzz on our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cats-bond-securely-to-their-humans-maybe-even-more-than-dogs-do"&gt;beloved clawed floofs&lt;/a&gt; is likely the result of a missing segment of DNA in a non-protein-coding part of the cat's genome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's been a genetic mystery, a conundrum," Stanford University geneticist Greg Barsh &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/gene-behind-orange-fur-cats-found-last"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Sara Reardon at &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barsh and his colleagues discovered cat skin cells from which orange fur sprouts express 13 times as much RNA from a gene called &lt;em&gt;Arhgap36&lt;/em&gt;, compared with skin cells from cats with no orange hair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expecting to find the protein-coding section of the overproductive &lt;em&gt;Arhgap36&lt;/em&gt;  gene had mutated, the researchers were surprised to find it was the sequence preceding it that instead contained a deletion, presumably affecting the rest of the gene's expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5 &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_pair#Length_measurements"&gt;kilobase&lt;/a&gt; deletion was present in every orange cat the researchers examined out of a database of 188 cats, which included 145 orange, 6 calico/tortoishell, and 37 nonorange cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One finding didn't come as a surprise. As long predicted, the mutated gene is located on the cat's X chromosome, explaining why the orange color appears so differently between the sexes. Most orange cats are male, while most female cats with some orange fur end up with patchworks of different colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145632" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145632" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/RedBlackAndWhiteCalicoKitten-e1733183714509.jpg" alt="Red black and white calico kitten" class="wp-image-145632 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/RedBlackAndWhiteCalicoKitten-e1733183714509.jpg 640w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/RedBlackAndWhiteCalicoKitten-e1733183714509-379x415.jpg 379w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/RedBlackAndWhiteCalicoKitten-e1733183714509-600x656.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145632" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A calico kitten. (Theresa Donahue McManus/Moment/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Taken together, these observations provide strong genetic and genomic evidence that the 5 kb deletion causes sex-linked orange," Barsh and team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.21.624608"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since humans first co-habitated with cats &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-lost-history-of-cat-domestication-can-finally-be-told"&gt;nearly 10,000 years ago&lt;/a&gt;, it's been a curiosity that a black cat and an orange cat can be parents to an unexpected array of kitten colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Male kittens from this pairing are mostly either orange or black, as might be expected. But female kittens can have a calico's patchwork of black, orange and white, or a tortoiseshell's marbling of orange scattered through black fur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145622" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145622" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/TortoiseshellCatWithOrangeMarblingThroughBlackFur-e1733181850151.jpg" alt="tortoiseshell cat with orange marbled through black fur" class="wp-image-145622 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145622" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A tortoiseshell cat. (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-close-up-of-a-cat-with-yellow-eyes-Q8EbbKgOPe0"&gt;Yosei G/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both teams confirmed the mutation responsible for orange fur is on the X chromosome, which is why such clear differences in colored patterning can appear between the sexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike males that end up with just one copy of this mutation on their solitary X chromosome, females end up with two copies, one on each the X's they receive from each parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mammals randomly inactivate one of the two X chromosomes in each of their cells to avoid expressing an excess of the chromosome's products. This leaves female orange kitties with an active orange mutation in some of their developing skin-cell tissues, right next to neighboring cells in which the X chromosome with the mutated gene is deactivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On rare occasions that both X chromosomes carry the mutation, the female grows into furry fireball as ginger as any male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145629" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145629" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/FieryOrangeKittenWithBlueEyes-e1733183466200.jpeg" alt="It's Taken Scientists 60 Years to Identify The Gene Making Orange Cats Usually Male" class="size-full wp-image-145629" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145629" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;An orange kitten. (Zelenenka/iStock/Getty Images Plus)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orange cats happen to have a hilarious reputation for &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/orange-cat-behavior"&gt;not being the brightest&lt;/a&gt; of their species. Anecdotes aside, such links between kitty coloration and cognition are scientifically unsupported, with no obvious negative consequences from this mutation in health or mental wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arhgap36&lt;/em&gt; is known to cause developmental problems in other animals when it is over- or under-functioning. But it seems that in orange cats, the gene is overexpressed only in developing and mature pigment cells called melanocytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The difference between tortoiseshell and calico cats is the presence of an additional white spotting mutation in calico that affects the ability of developing melanocytes to survive as they migrate away from the neural crest, allowing melanocyte clones that do survive to expand in a larger body region," Barsh and colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.21.624608"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second study, led by Kyushu University geneticist Hidehiro Toh, also identified &lt;em&gt;Arhgap36&lt;/em&gt; as the orange cat fur gene. They found greater expression of this gene suppresses color pigment genes, shifting the dark brown to black &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin#Eumelanin"&gt;eumelanin&lt;/a&gt; pigments to the reddish to yellow &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin#Pheomelanin"&gt;pheomelanin&lt;/a&gt; pigments.&lt;/p&gt;

A study of over 2,200 identical twins found that maternal warmth between ages 5 and 10 predicted higher levels of openness, conscientiousness, and agreeableness at age 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These traits are closely tied to long-term success and well-being, suggesting even modest improvements in parenting could have widespread societal benefits. The research also emphasizes that personality development is shaped by a complex interplay of genetics, parenting, and life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parenting Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Maternal warmth predicted increased openness, conscientiousness, and agreeableness in adulthood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twin Study Design:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers used identical twins to control for genetic and shared environmental factors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Population Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Boosting affectionate parenting may improve educational, economic, and health outcomes at scale.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;APA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affectionate mothering in childhood may have a lasting impact on important personality traits, potentially influencing life outcomes such as educational achievement, economic success, and health and well-being, according to research published by the American Psychological Association. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that positive maternal parenting could foster important traits such as openness, conscientiousness and agreeableness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108826"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mother-affection-personality-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mother-affection-personality-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mother-affection-personality-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mother-affection-personality-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mother-affection-personality-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mother-affection-personality-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mother-affection-personality-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mother-affection-personality-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a mom and child." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mother-affection-personality-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mother-affection-personality-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mother-affection-personality-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mother-affection-personality-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mother-affection-personality-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mother-affection-personality-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/mother-affection-personality-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Researchers found no lasting associations between maternal affection and extraversion or neuroticism. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Personality traits are strong predictors of important life outcomes, from academic and career success to health and well-being,” said Jasmin Wertz, PhD, lead author of the study and a professor of psychology at the University of Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that fostering positive parenting environments in early childhood could have a small but significant and lasting impact on the development of these crucial personality traits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wertz and her colleagues examined how maternal affection during childhood—specifically between the ages of 5 and 10—predicted the Big Five personality traits at age 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Big Five personality traits are viewed by personality psychologists as the five basic dimensions of human personality: extraversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness and neuroticism, or emotional stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;American Psychologist&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined data from 2,232 British identical twins (51.1% female) who were followed from birth through age 18 as part of the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twins Study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studying identical twins allows researchers to control for genetic and environmental factors by comparing identical twins who grew up in the same family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the study, researchers conducted home visits with the twins’ mothers and recorded them talking about each of their children. Trained observers then rated the mothers’ responses for warmth and affection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twins whose mothers expressed more warmth toward them in childhood were rated as more open, conscientious and agreeable as young adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results offer evidence that positive, affectionate mothering can affect key personality traits that are linked to success later in life, and these influences could have an impact across generations, said Wertz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that even modest changes in personality could lead to significant population-wide benefits over time, particularly in promoting conscientiousness, which is strongly associated with success in education, work and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found no lasting associations between maternal affection and extraversion or neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that other environmental or genetic factors—such as peer relationships, life experiences, and perhaps later interventions—may be more influential for these in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also underscore the importance of considering both genetic and environmental factors when designing programs aimed at promoting positive personality traits, according to Wertz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research provides valuable evidence for the potential of parenting programs to influence critical aspects of personality development,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, it also highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of how different factors, including genetics, parenting and life experiences, interact to shape who we are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wertz believes the research provides important practical considerations for policymakers and practitioners working in education, family welfare and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that conscientiousness may predict success in school and the workplace, interventions designed to enhance affectionate parenting could contribute to improving educational outcomes, mental health and social well-being on a broader scale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are many proven ways to support parents, such as policies that improve a family’s financial situation; access to treatment for parents who struggle with mental health problems such as depression; and parenting programs that help parents build stronger relationships with their children,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also sheds light on the possibility of developing parental training models to address inequalities in personality development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By targeting parenting practices that promote positive traits in childhood, it may be possible to reduce disparities in life outcomes associated with socioeconomic background, family dynamics and other environmental factors,” Wertz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#563c253a3f21371637263778392431" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;James Sliwa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://apa.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;APA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;James Sliwa – APA&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-amp0001508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Parenting in Childhood Predicts Personality in Early Adulthood: A Longitudinal Twin-Differences Study&lt;/a&gt;” by Jasmin Wertz et al. &lt;em&gt;American Psychologist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 20:58:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5mV3czRUxYRDlTVXhtMHYwaTIwdERBbU1sbElmWUpzbDhaRk04VnRPMHF4Mmt1QXZJQUY4NHRjM3ZUQkFZcVBrNmNGOGw5S2huTU1ROU05UFdJbzBwTF93alNvUW9qVE52TXNTS19zNkFtSjZM</guid></item></channel></rss>
