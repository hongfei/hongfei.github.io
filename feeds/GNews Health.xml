&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most infectious viruses we know of and can linger in the airspace of a room for up to two hours after an infected person has been present. Among unvaccinated people exposed to an infectious person, up to 90 percent will become ill. Many infections are only identified when measles’ telltale rash develops, but a person can be infectious for four days &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; that rash develops, allowing the virus to more easily spread. People remain infectious for four days after the rash appears. In newly infected people, symptoms, which also include high fevers, typically begin 7 to 14 days after exposure, but this incubation period can be as long as 21 days, which is the length of quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-reports-89-new-measles-cases-upstate-bringing-outbreak-total-789"&gt;latest update&lt;/a&gt;, South Carolina’s Public Health Department reported data indicating that its large case jumps will continue. In recent weeks, officials have identified 23 schools where measles has been unleashed. In 20 of the schools, unvaccinated and exposed students have been identified and quarantined, with individual schools’ quarantine totals spanning 13 to 59 students. For the remaining three schools with exposures, officials are still determining how many students need to be quarantined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State officials have also identified eight public places where measles exposures have occurred recently, including grocery stores, a US Post Office, and a skating center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, 557 students are quarantined, but additional susceptible people have likely been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the 789 cases, 769 (97 percent) were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated or had an undocumented vaccination status. Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine are 97 percent effective against measles, and that protection is considered lifelong.&lt;/p&gt;

The ministry did not release details about the patients but said 196 contacts had been traced and all tested negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“The situation is under constant monitoring, and all necessary public health measures are in place,” the ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Nipah, a zoonotic virus first identified during a 1990s outbreak in Malaysia, spreads through fruit bats, pigs and human-to-human contact. There is no vaccine for the virus, which can cause raging fevers, convulsions and vomiting. The only treatment is supportive care to control complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The virus has an estimated fatality rate of between 40% and 75%, according to the WHO, making it far more deadly than the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There were no reported cases of the virus outside India, but several Asian countries introduced or reinforced screening measures at airports as a precaution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Indonesia and Thailand increased screening at major airports, with health declarations, temperature checks and visual monitoring for arriving passengers. Thailand’s Department of Disease Control said thermal scanners had been installed at arrival gates for direct flights from West Bengal at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Myanmar’s Health Ministry advised against nonessential travel to West Bengal and urged travelers to seek immediate medical care if symptoms develop within 14 days of travel. It said fever surveillance introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic at airports has been intensified for passengers arriving from India, with laboratory testing capacity and medical supplies readied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Vietnam’s Health Ministry on Tuesday urged strict food safety practices and directed local authorities to increase monitoring at border crossings, health facilities and communities, according to state media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;China said it was strengthening disease prevention measures in border areas.

Nepal has also begun screening arrivals at Kathmandu airport and other land border points with India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Two cases have been confirmed in West Bengal since December, reportedly in healthcare workers. Some 196 people who were in contact with them have been traced and tested negative for the virus, India's health ministry says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The virus can spread from animals to humans. It has a high death range – ranging from 40% to 75% – as there is no vaccine or medicine to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What is the Nipah virus and what are its symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Nipah virus can be transmitted from animals, like pigs and fruit bats, to humans. It can also spread person-to-person through contaminated food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The World Health Organization has described Nipah in its top ten priority diseases, along with pathogens like Covid-19 and Zika, because of its potential to trigger an epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The incubation period ranges from four to 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People who contract the virus show a wide range of symptoms, or sometimes, none at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Initial symptoms may include fever, headaches, muscle pain, vomiting and sore throat. In some people, these may be followed by drowsiness, altered consciousness, and pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Encephalitis, a sometimes-fatal condition that causes inflammation of the brain, may occur in severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To date, no drugs of vaccines have been approved to treat the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;[BBC]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Where were the past outbreaks?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The first recognised Nipah outbreak was in 1998 among pig farmers in Malaysia and later spread to neighbouring Singapore. The virus got its name from the village where it was first discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More than 100 people died and a million pigs culled in an effort to contain the virus. It also resulted in significant economic losses for farmers and those in the livestock trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bangladesh has borne the brunt in recent years, with more than 100 people dying of Nipah since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The virus has also been detected in India. Outbreaks were reported in West Bengal in 2001 and 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More recently, the southern state of Kerala has been a Nipah hotspot. In 2018, 19 cases were reported of which 17 were fatal; and in 2023, two out of six confirmed cases later died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What is happening now?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;India's health ministry said that following confirmation of the cases in West Bengal, contacts of the infected individuals were "identified, traced, monitored, and tested" - and had been found to be asymptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The situation is under constant monitoring, and all necessary public health measures are in place," the ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;No cases have yet been reported outside India, but several countries are stepping up precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On Sunday, Thailand started screening passengers at three international airports in Bangkok and Phuket that receive flights from West Bengal. Passengers from these flights have been asked to make health declarations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The parks and wildlife department has also implemented stricter screenings in natural tourist attractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Jurai Wongswasdi, a spokeswoman for the Department for Disease Control, told BBC Thai authorities are "fairly confident" about guarding against an outbreak in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nepal, too, has begun screening people arriving through the airport in Kathmandu and other land border points with India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meanwhile, health authorities in Taiwan have proposed to list the Nipah virus as a "Category 5 disease". Under the island's system, diseases classified as Category 5 are emerging or rare infections with major public health risks, that require immediate reporting and special control measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this story said that at least five people had been infected in West Bengal but India's health ministry later released a statement saying only two cases had been confirmed in the state since December.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Canada</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:49:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOUUpJdmZ6b2Q2SjZoQ2NMMXRNbDRYRWNNQV85YWtBZllvUUhUMHNOa1NIVTNVSHRjWi1fNVh4aEU1cnYxQlZudzlXS3NNOFlSb2xmMkhHRUs0Y2VjdzV5Wl9fTW9JeTdhX3lvSWVYOFN6YU0zYTYwUGdINzBsaHc0YmJB</guid></item><item><title>服用维生素D以最大限度吸收的最佳时间-健康：值得信赖和富有同理心的健康和保健信息</title><link>https://www.health.com/best-time-to-take-vitamin-d-for-maximum-absorption-11893374</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D offers crucial benefits, such as supporting strong, healthy bones and enabling calcium absorption—but many people don’t get enough of it.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Supplements can help fill the gap, but is there a best time to take vitamin D for optimal absorption? According to experts, what you pair vitamin D with matters more than timing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-best-time-to-take-vitamin-d-for-absorption"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no evidence that vitamin D is absorbed better at certain times of the day, according to &lt;a href="https://www.drvictoriamaizes.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Victoria Maizes, MD&lt;/a&gt;, founding executive director of the Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rather than timing, what’s more important is taking vitamin D with a meal that contains fat, she said. That’s because vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, meaning it needs fat to dissolve and be stored in tissue.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While taking vitamin D with the largest meal of the day—the one likely to contain the most fat—is a good idea, pairing it with any amount of fat can help with absorption, said &lt;a href="https://bodytosoulhealth.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jen Bianchini, MS, RD, IFNCP&lt;/a&gt;, functional nutritionist and founder at Body to Soul Health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/saturated-vs-unsaturated-fat-8633405" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;type of fat&lt;/a&gt; you pair the supplement with doesn’t appear to matter—one study found no difference in vitamin D absorption when supplements were taken with both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Foods such as nuts, avocados, fish, or olive oil could all be good choices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-factors-to-consider"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to taking vitamin D with certain foods, dosage also plays a role in effectiveness. Not surprisingly, larger doses lead to greater absorption, Maizes said. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, it is possible to take too much vitamin D. Though rare, high doses taken over long periods can cause &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/side-effects-too-much-vitamin-d-11867499" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D toxicity&lt;/a&gt;, which can lead to symptoms like nausea, vomiting, frequent urination, bone pain, low appetite, and fatigue.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To avoid this, Maizes recommends not exceeding 4,000 International Units (IU) per day unless advised by a doctor. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Choosing the right form of the vitamin is another major consideration. “Vitamin D3 requires less conversion than D2 and is more effective at raising blood levels, so Vitamin D3 is usually recommended,” said Bianchini. In fact, according to 2022 research, vitamin D3 injections were twice as effective as D2 when used alone and three times more effective when combined with an oral tablet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-who-can-benefit-most-from-taking-vitamin-d"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for vitamin D is 600 IU per day for adults under 70, which increases to 800 IU for those over 70.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Many people have difficulty reaching these targets because vitamin D is found in only a &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/foods-high-in-vitamin-d-11884949" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;limited number of foods&lt;/a&gt;, such as oily fish and eggs, and often in small amounts. You can also get vitamin D through ultraviolet rays, but you need about 10 to 20 minutes of direct sunlight (without sunscreen) per day to get the required amount, Bianchini said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because it can be challenging to obtain sufficient vitamin D, Bianchini believes many people may benefit from supplementation. Certain groups—such as those who live at northern latitudes, have darker skin pigmentation, or spend little time in the sun—may be particularly good candidates, according to Maizes. Weight status is another risk factor for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/causes-of-vitamin-d-deficiency-11862028" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;low vitamin D levels&lt;/a&gt;. “Obese adults are less able to produce vitamin D through sun exposure,” Maizes explained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re deficient in vitamin D, you may experience symptoms like muscle pain or weakness, bone pain, and tingling in the hands and feet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, a blood test is the best way to know if you’re lacking the nutrient. With regular testing, your healthcare team can help you determine whether a supplement is right for you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                    &lt;span id="StoryTextTop"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                                
                                
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        The problem with popular teeth-whitening agents, like peroxide-based gels, is that they risk damaging tooth enamel while they bleach. Now, Chinese scientists say they've developed a better option: one that instead repairs tooth enamel while it whitens. The prototype whitening powder activates when exposed to the vibrations of an electric toothbrush, per the &lt;a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/science/teeth-whitening-repair-powder-toothbrush-b2908378.html"&gt;Independent&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike common peroxide-based whitening products, which generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can erode enamel while lifting stains, this powder is designed to limit ROS production to brushing time and to strengthen teeth in the process.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            

                            &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        The material, called BSCT, is made from charged particles of strontium and calcium combined with barium titanate, then heated into a ceramic powder. When the powder is put under stress through vibration, it produces a tiny electric field—similar to how quartz crystals power watches—which in turn triggers ROS-generating reactions that break down stain molecules. In lab tests on human teeth stained with tea and coffee, four hours of brushing with BSCT and an electric toothbrush produced visible whitening; after 12 hours, the treated teeth were nearly 50% brighter than those brushed with saline alone.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Researchers say the ions in the powder also helped rebuild damaged enamel and dentin by forming mineral deposits on tooth surfaces, per &lt;a href="https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/whitening-tooth-powder/"&gt;New Atlas&lt;/a&gt;. In a separate experiment, rats on a high-sugar diet brushed for one minute daily over four weeks showed a healthier oral microbiome, with reductions in harmful bacteria linked to gum disease. The team, whose study appears in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.5c16997"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, describes the approach as a potential at-home option that combines whitening, enamel repair, cavity prevention, and support for beneficial mouth bacteria, though further testing will be needed before any consumer product hits the market.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

There’s a laser show and hotdogs and a raffle. There’s also a bar for the parents, which makes my two pull up short. Newcomers to this country experience many cultural differences but perhaps none as striking as this: “Is that alcohol?” says my child, scowling up at me like a tiny member of the Taliban. “At a school thing?” I’m two Baileys hot chocolates in at this point and give her a smile 10% broader than necessary. Yes, my darlings; welcome to Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Or at least, welcome, possibly, to the last vestiges of how Britain once was. For a while now we’ve known anecdotally that people in this country are drinking less than they were. My own generation X is deep into middle age and many of us – save for the odd life-saver at a school event and the biggest occasions – have given it up. Where the anomalies fall more glaringly is in the generations below us, among young people whose behaviour differs from our own at their age. This week, official confirmation came in the form of a survey of 10,000 people commissioned by the NHS that found almost a quarter (24%) of adults in England had &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/27/one-in-four-adults-in-england-do-not-drink-alcohol" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;not drunk alcohol&lt;/a&gt; in 2024, an increase from just under a fifth (19%) in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The top line, of course, is that this is a good thing. Not for the drinks industry, obviously, but for the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;, and also for people trying to maximise their life expectancy, which is all of us. Rigorous self-optimisation via application to the data is how we spend our leisure time these days, on the strength of which, after reading a piece about cancer-reducing foods this morning, I bought a “wheatberry, lentil and green vegetable salad” that I’m almost certainly not going to eat. What even is a wheatberry? Nobody knows. The point is we’re trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If I sound sarcastic, I don’t mean to. I love not drinking. And it’s important not to join the ranks of those people in the generation above mine who, in the 1990s, when &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jul/01/it-has-had-a-real-social-impact-readers-on-the-smoking-ban-ten-years-on" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;smoking bans&lt;/a&gt; took hold across the US, wrote long pieces arguing that cigarettes represented the buccaneer spirit of the country and, as a result, smokers were more interesting than people who drank “green juice”. These were, objectively, the worst people in the world and, while no one likes a teetotaller, it’s important to resist turning into them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;My interest is more in what youth culture will look like without alcohol. The new survey results, which were commissioned as part of the Health Survey for England, found that women are slightly less likely to drink than men and that across the age groups young people are the most abstemious. In the &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/390/bmj.r1247" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2022 NHS survey&lt;/a&gt;, gen Z reportedly contained the lowest proportion of people who drank frequently (10%), compared with 34% among 55 to 64-year-olds and 37% of 65 to 74-year-olds. Some of this is cost-of-living related, but most of it is likely to be cultural. It’s just not cool to be wasted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"index":5,"listId":6056,"identityName":"matters-of-opinion","description":"Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more","name":"Matters of Opinion","frequency":"Weekly","successDescription":"Subscription confirmed.","theme":"opinion","idApiUrl":"https://idapi.theguardian.com","hideNewsletterSignupComponentForSubscribers":true}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure id="16d56077-98bd-49d8-b5ea-3ed7a93f3845" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Why are saunas suddenly everywhere?

During the intake interview a few years ago, my new doctor made a note of what everyone in my family going back three generations had died of, before giving me a very stern look. “If I were you I wouldn’t drink,” she said. “At all.” This was harsh, but she was right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And yet, still my imagination falters. I look at my two and wonder what, when they’re 25, a Saturday night out will look like if it doesn’t terminate in them lying half off the sofa crying to Elaine Paige doing the big ballad from Chess. Where will their war stories come from? (Actual war, probably, but let’s not think about that.) What will they reminisce about when they are my age?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There’s nothing funny about my friend who threw up into a heating vent and, for the rest of her tenancy, couldn’t expunge the smell of sick from her flat. Standing, swaying gently, in the middle of a busy A-road trying to work out a strategy for getting to the other side that didn’t involve putting one foot in front of the other isn’t funny, either. I told my children this story and they were horrified. “You could’ve DIED,” they said, which was precisely the teachable moment I was after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Meanwhile, the new findings aren’t anything to grow complacent about, since, even with these reduced numbers, we’re still sufficiently a nation of alcoholics to cost the NHS in England &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/may/17/27bn-a-year-spent-in-england-on-harm-done-by-alcohol-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;£4.9bn a year&lt;/a&gt; in alcohol-related illness. In the spirit of which: I’m actually quite looking forward to eating my salad. I’m going to put an egg in it because, while not drinking is extremely good for you, as everyone knows it’s actually protein that will save us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:08:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPeEN5Uk5RalNva3lUSEh1VElVZUJveW1mY0xHZmpXYmdHTk9mdktVMGlsTll6cEc1SGdWQUFPYUlDUGpPV01JQmc0cE1VNi03dHFNVzBjV3dwU2owYndyZUNLX290alhTNmlKZThKbjZBNV9nQXh4bEZxc1hvby1YYnJ6c3Q3OVNHQWFsMjdVYS1XVFpQcHc</guid></item><item><title>西班牙科学家在重大医学突破中找到治愈胰腺癌的方法-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/science/spanish-scientist-finds-cure-for-pancreatic-cancer-in-major-medical-breakthrough/articleshow/127714543.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Spanish research team says it has developed a treatment that completely eliminated the most aggressive form of pancreatic cancer in laboratory mice, raising fresh hopes against one of the deadliest cancers. The study, led by Mariano Barbacid at Spain’s Spanish National Cancer Research Centre, found that a newly designed triple-drug therapy wiped out pancreatic tumours with no relapse seen after treatment. After six years of work, researchers reported that the animals showed minimal side effects and no tumour recurrence, results that mark one of the most promising advances yet in pancreatic cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pancreatic cancer and the therapy behind the breakthrough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic cancer, particularly pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, is among the deadliest malignancies due to its resistance to treatment, dense tumour microenvironment, and late diagnosis. Standard therapies often fail because tumours rapidly adapt, bypassing single-target drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CNIO therapy takes a different approach. Instead of attacking one pathway, it combines three drugs to shut down multiple tumour survival mechanisms simultaneously. According to the researchers, this strategy prevents cancer cells from rewiring themselves, a common cause of treatment failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barbacid has previously argued that pancreatic cancer cannot be defeated with a single-drug strategy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tumour, he has said in earlier research discussions, is extraordinarily adaptable, and only coordinated inhibition of multiple pathways can produce lasting responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the study found in laboratory models&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In controlled laboratory experiments, mice with advanced pancreatic tumours experienced complete tumour elimination after receiving the triple-drug therapy. Even more notable was what happened afterwards. During extended follow-up, researchers observed no tumour regrowth, suggesting that the therapy may suppress the biological mechanisms that typically drive relapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), where reviewers highlighted both the durability of the response and the unusually low toxicity seen in treated animals, a critical factor for any therapy aimed at human use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent cancer researchers not involved in the study have noted that durable responses without relapse are exceptionally rare in pancreatic cancer models, making the results particularly significant within the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who is Mariano Barbacid?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barbacid is one of Europe’s most influential cancer researchers. In the early 1980s, he helped identify the first human oncogene, a discovery that fundamentally reshaped modern cancer biology and established the genetic basis of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past four decades, his work has repeatedly focused on KRAS-driven tumours, long considered among the hardest cancers to treat. Because KRAS mutations are present in roughly 90 per cent of pancreatic cancers, Barbacid’s sustained focus on this pathway gives the current breakthrough added weight within the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funding, institutions, and credibility&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted at CNIO, one of Europe’s leading cancer research institutions, with support from Fundación CRIS Contra el Cáncer, which funds high-risk, high-impact cancer research projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study followed established experimental protocols and underwent independent peer review before publication.

Many users hailed the findings as a cure, while others questioned whether pharmaceutical or regulatory barriers could delay progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such reactions reflect a broader tension in cancer research communication, namely the gap between legitimate scientific caution and public desperation for definitive cures, particularly for diseases with historically grim outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next phase involves further validation studies and safety testing, followed, if funding and regulatory approvals allow, by early-stage human trials.

&lt;p&gt;13,700 years ago was roughly when humans first started populating South America and rapidly spread around the continent. And, based on this discovery, the bacteria of the &lt;i&gt;Treponema pallidum&lt;/i&gt; lineage were already diverse and capable of infecting people by then. This Late Pleistocene divergence, the authors note in their study, hints at the ancient pan-human distribution. Various &lt;i&gt;Treponema pallidum&lt;/i&gt; subspecies were probably our fellow travelers spreading globally with the first humans that migrated out of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s much more we need to learn before the “Columbian” syphilis origin debate is settled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="p2"&gt;Beyond the Columbian story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the 1495 siege of Naples remains the moment syphilis etched itself into the European psyche as a new and terrifying plague, it was likely just one violent flare-up in a relationship between humans and &lt;em&gt;Treponema&lt;/em&gt; pathogens that spans continents and millennia. What we don’t know is when and where the important turning points in this relationship took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear when and why &lt;i&gt;Treponema pallidum&lt;/i&gt; evolved its sexual transmission, so evidently present in the subspecies that caused the outbreak in Naples. It’s also unclear whether the 1495 pandemic was triggered by a newly imported strain or a mutation of a lineage already present in Europe. The team hopes analyzing other ancient pathogen genomes hosted by people from different places on the globe and different social contexts—hunter-gatherers, farmers, city dwellers—will answer at least some of these questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, it’s hard to infer a specific pathogen’s features from ancient genomes. “With the data we have today, we can’t say anything about the virulence of this ancient &lt;i&gt;Treponema pallidum&lt;/i&gt; subspecies, about how the symptoms of the disease it caused looked like, or about its mode of transmission,” Bozzi says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we do know, however, is that thousands of years ago, the &lt;i&gt;Treponema pallidum&lt;/i&gt; lineage was likely way more diverse than it is today. “In the future we’d love to look at broader ecological interactions between humans, animals, the environment, and the pathogens,” says Nelson. “We’d love to explore this diversity further.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The People’s Pharmacy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; I stopped dyeing my hair in 2018 and got new photos for my passport and driver’s license once my hair turned white. Now my hair is turning dark brown while I’m on rosuvastatin. I started this prescription to lower my cholesterol in September 2024, and my hair started changing color within six months. Now it is hideous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I saw articles about this possibility on your website. Is there an alternative cholesterol medicine that won’t affect hair color? I’m seriously considering stopping this medication to see if my hair will go back to white, which I now prefer. Help!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; It has been quite a while since a reader has reported hair darkening while taking a cholesterol-lowering medication. We received more complaints about ezetimibe (Zetia), but a few people also reported an experience like yours associated with simvastatin (Zocor) and rosuvastatin (Crestor). Drug-induced hair color changes are uncommon (European Journal of Dermatology, Dec. 1, 2016).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other medications that could help you control your cholesterol. You should discuss this with your health care provider. To prepare for that conversation, you might want to read our “eGuide to Cholesterol Control and Heart Health.” It is located under the Health eGuides tab at peoplespharmacy.com. In it, you’ll find discussions of the most common pros and cons of the various cholesterol-lowering medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;In the early 1970s, my doctor prescribed Afrin for nasal congestion. I used it so often that eventually I had to carry it everywhere because I couldn’t breathe without it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get off it, I used the spray in only one nostril. That let the other one clear and open up. It took a lot of patience, but it worked. Then I never used it again. I still use Neo-Synephrine, children’s strength, when I’m congested but very sparingly. I never want to be like that again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Once upon a time, Afrin (oxymetazoline) was available only by prescription. That changed in 1975 when the Food and Drug Administration allowed over-the-counter sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people have reported rebound congestion after using oxymetazoline nasal spray for more than several days. This topical decongestant is the active ingredient in Afrin No Drip, for example. Your tactic of using the spray in just one nostril can be effective for getting past rebound congestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When shopping for a nasal spray, be careful to read the ingredients. In addition to the oxymetazoline version, Afrin also has a drug-free saline nasal mist and an extra-strength “Saline Burst” product with seawater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt; I have practiced medicine for decades. I learned long ago that many men begin to experience lower testosterone levels in their thirties and forties. Some older men end up with very low levels of this hormone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have found that testosterone replacement therapy can help these guys maintain both bone and muscle strength. I believe the best benefit is mental clarity and warding off depression. I am glad that the FDA has eased off its cardiovascular warnings, which had no scientific basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it is absurd, though, that doctors are required to have a DEA license to prescribe testosterone. That’s because it is considered a “controlled” substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;The FDA has indeed withdrawn its boxed warning about heart attacks and strokes from testosterone products. This hormone is still classified as a “Schedule III” controlled substance. That means the Drug Enforcement Administration believes it has a modest potential to create physical or psychological dependence.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This workout will target your legs, core, upper body, and balance. Try to do the bodyweight circuit two to three times per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While walking workouts help your cardiovascular fitness, they won’t strengthen your muscles and bones in the same way as strength training, even when using just your bodyweight. Strength training can help increase bone density, which may prevent osteoporosis and minimize your risk of injuries from falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="6eb7d678-a175-4b8b-b4da-0ccea9f3a17a"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;a id="elk-76bad126-1caf-4018-ac19-e0f77d238beb" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-a-total-beginner-3"&gt;What advice would you give to a total beginner? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="814c54c2-dabf-4d20-a951-bfab3178ebf1"&gt;“First: You are not behind.

She recommends starting by adding simple exercises like the ones above into your daily routine, using walls and counters for support, as well as walking daily to improve your fitness slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The only rules: No comparing, no need to rush, progress slowly, celebrate everything — the small wins are WINS and a reminder to ask — what is next? Do it again the next day!” she says. “And remember: you don’t train to look younger, you train to live better. The overall benefits are stronger bones, better balance, more confidence, and less fear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr id="f49e8b93-5aa7-49e8-adb6-e9e621092012"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE" rel="nofollow" id="6fe46253-f403-4550-b180-34f95947a1b0" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check=""&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="87da8b77-7ba5-4c61-8fb7-c05d85e2462a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE" target="_blank" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom's Guide on Google News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=tomsguide.com" target="_blank" data-url="https://google.com/preferences/source?q=tomsguide.com" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;add us as a preferred source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr id="7e752081-3d43-4491-91cd-2af6bf87b938"&gt;&lt;a id="elk-more-from-tom-s-guide" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom's Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

He’d seen my round 9-month pregnant belly and made a lighthearted joke. But a shock to my chest stopped my breath where I stood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was late November in 2024, but my body was transported to our pregnancy four years ago when our son’s identical twin brother died inside of me, and I was forced to carry both of them, one dead, one still alive, until their birthday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I pretended not to hear him and continued my daily walk with our dog, acting like her reactivity was the reason I was trying to scurry away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He called out again. “I said, ‘You got twins in there?’ I swear you got some twins!!” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I restrained myself from responding back, “I did have twins, but one of them is dead!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Don’t make him uncomfortable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; I scolded myself before the words left my mouth. “No…” I weakly replied with my own friendly wave as I waddled down the sidewalk. “Just a week past my due date!” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I rounded the corner and heard my heart pounding in my ears. I ignored my you’ll-be-giving-birth-any-day pelvic pain, praying the tears that rushed to my eyes would wait until I got back home to fall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As time passes, grief becomes easier to carry. I no longer have panic attacks several times a day, and I can finally fall asleep without crying. But there are still moments when the loss rattles me to my core, as if it just happened last week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When I got home, my husband was in the kitchen. I walked straight into his arms and sobbed as if it were the day we had lost our sweet Killian. He held me with a familiar knowing that this was about our son.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2020, we bounced with joy when we found out we were pregnant with two healthy identical twin boys, after battling our way through three consecutive miscarriages. We had always talked about wanting twins.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The doctors called the boys Baby A and Baby B. We had always said if we had twin boys we would name them Seamus and Killian ― two strong Irish names! Sitting silently in the car looking at our ultrasounds, my joy slowly evaporated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“John…I know it sounds morbid, but I want to name which baby is Seamus and which baby is Killian. In case we lose one of them…I don’t want us needing to decide which name we keep.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Halfway through the pregnancy we indeed received an alarming diagnosis; Killian had become terminally ill. He had no chance of survival. Since he and his brother, Seamus, shared a placenta, the doctors would have to cauterize Killian’s umbilical cord, removing his life support ― and removing his connection to me ― in order to save Seamus’ life. We would lose both boys if we did nothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I carried both of them inside of me for the remainder of the pregnancy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Each appointment we would check in on Seamus. We’d see him wiggling, posing, tossing and turning. We’d make jokes about him becoming a dancer or gymnast or soccer player.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then, with our permission, we’d scan over to Killian’s lifeless body. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He still matched his brother in size and shape, initially. But as the pregnancy progressed, he grew smaller and smaller. Eventually Seamus’ full-term size shoved Killian into a pocket under my right ribs. Every ultrasound we would see their distinct differences and be reminded of what would never be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author during pregnancy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Photo Courtesy Of Jayme Serbell"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Photo Courtesy Of Jayme Serbell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Growing up, I was always taught that pregnancy was a blissful time. New life is beautiful. A person’s expanding belly, a miracle; something to celebrate out loud.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I wasn’t taught how common miscarriage and pregnancy loss was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I didn’t know that you could be pregnant and miscarry without even knowing it. That you could suddenly have the most painful period of your life and never even know the blood coming out of you were the early stages of organs, fingers and toes, a child. 2017 taught me this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I didn’t know that doctors could blandly tell you that your pregnancy wasn’t viable. I didn’t know that you could be asked if you wanted to scrape out the dying tissue inside of your uterus now or to pass the unsuccessful pregnancy naturally at home, as casually as a grocer would ask you if you want paper or plastic. Spring of 2019 taught me this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I didn’t know that asking, “Why does this keep happening??” could land you in an over-the-top fancy office, with floor-to-ceiling glass windows, and a doctor decked out in a gaudy watch and designer suit explaining that a simple house downpayment could secure the possibility of maybe having kids someday. Fall of 2019 taught me this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Early on in our twin pregnancy, when they both seemed healthy, I still felt the sting of well-intentioned comments from strangers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Oh, is this your first child?” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Well, no, but hopefully they will be our first living ones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Something I never said, but always wanted to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author with her son.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Photo Courtesy Of Jayme Serbell"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Photo Courtesy Of Jayme Serbell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After we lost Killian, we lived in two stark realities. In public, we were excitedly met with, “Is it a boy or a girl??” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What do I say without it turning into a trauma dump on a person who just wanted to bask in the presence of new life? In private, we’d hold each other tight as we removed the doubles of everything off of our baby registry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pregnancy turns a body into a conversation starter. A pregnant belly seems to act as an invitation for questioning, guessing, commenting and touching. Most of those questions only make sense if pregnancy is joyful, safe and inevitably headed toward a happy ending.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People ask, speculate and joke because pregnancy is often treated as a collective experience with a predictable outcome, not a private one filled with uncertainty. It’s easier to engage with the version of pregnancy we expect than the one that actually exists. I can’t recall a single stranger asking me how it was really going, or whether it felt manageable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What was missing from those interactions was any acknowledgment that pregnancy can be complicated, heavy or fragile. The assumption of hope and health didn’t uplift me. Our reality didn’t emotionally align with the comments we received, and that disconnect created distance instead of connection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Near the end of our twin pregnancy, I was waddling around a Walmart when a stranger struck up a conversation with me about a book I was holding. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was excited to connect with someone new since we lived in a remote place, and it was simultaneously the height of COVID-19. I missed other people. I was about to ask them another question about themselves when suddenly…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You sure you don’t have two in there?” they playfully asked, pointing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like the bus driver who asked me if I was pregnant with twins, they were being playful and silly. Their voices didn’t carry any cruelty. I can understand the warmth they extended my way, but my chest still hollowed out like a cold underground cave, and left me shivering with the remembrance of what I had lost.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author holding a positive pregnancy test.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Photo Courtesy Of Jayme Surbell"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Photo Courtesy Of Jayme Surbell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even when a pregnancy is going smoothly, it can still hold immense physical, emotional and psychological weight. Invisible grief can be deeply isolating, and I’ve come to understand how common it actually is. People are often carrying more than they show. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our experiences have changed how I interact with people who are pregnant. I’m more careful with my words now. When I can, I ask about their heart: H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;ow are you &lt;/em&gt;feeling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; I’m careful to avoid saying anything about their bodies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’ve learned firsthand that the way a body looks rarely tells the whole story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; And sometimes the most meaningful thing we can offer is space for whatever might live inside that unknown.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have a compelling personal story you’d like to see published on HuffPost?

In two of those communities, Sardinia, Italy, and Ikaria, Greece, drinking red wine is an important daily ritual.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The majority of people in the Mediterranean Blue Zones — who live up to 10 years longer than Americans do — are drinking a glass or two of local red wine daily, usually with a meal, family and friends.

Their diet is high in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;fruits and vegetables, they are close with family and friends, and they get regular exercise.

In small amounts, it can raise good cholesterol, have a blood-thinning effect and lower blood pressure. This was not specific to red wine, though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You may have heard that the polyphenols, or antioxidants, in red wine are what cause this, but this is unproven. There may not be enough polyphenols in a glass of wine to make a difference, and the cardiovascular impact has also been observed when people drink other types of alcohol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your heart isn’t the only area of focus when it comes to your body’s reaction to alcohol. Small quantities may also reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Moderate alcohol, 5 to 10 ounces a day, has been shown to potentially reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, some of the studies showed patients even losing a few pounds over time. … And even in our diabetic patients, we’re seeing improvements in blood sugars with moderate alcohol use, in particular with red wine,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://crousemed.com/physicians-providers-directory/steven-zygmont-md/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Steven Zygmont" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69603102e4b0120ab25c86df" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://crousemed.com/physicians-providers-directory/steven-zygmont-md/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Steven Zygmont&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, diabetes and metabolism endocrinologist with Crouse Health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s possible that the polyphenols cause red wine to have a slightly better effect than other drinks, or it may be a result of the way that people typically consume red wine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health practitioners have major concerns about communicating these findings, which can easily be misunderstood. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s a really tricky public health message because of all of the dangers of alcohol,” Rimm said. “It’s unlike other things in public health, because if you tell people, ‘you should have more fruits and vegetables,’ they’re not likely to binge on fruits and vegetables on Friday and Saturday. But alcohol has the problem that the pattern is probably equally as important as the amount,” Rimm said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Tatiana Maksimova via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Tatiana Maksimova via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;All alcohol, no matter the type, is a known carcinogen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given the addictive nature of alcohol, one glass of wine can easily become two or more. It’s a fine line: Drinking a little has a low risk, but increasing the amount can dramatically raise your risk.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plus, regardless of the other health implications, alcohol — including wine — is a known carcinogen. So, while heart disease remains the leading cause of death, cancer follows closely in second place. When it comes to cancer risk, there’s no safe amount of alcohol. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Risks related to cancer should not be ignored, and considered on an individual basis,” Piano said. “Some advice we give to people is, ’If you have a really strong family history of cancer, then you may want to have less or no alcohol. Everybody can choose to drink nothing; however, there are many lifestyle behaviors we can engage in to reduce our risk of chronic disease.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Make Informed Choices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, what does wine actually look like in the longevity picture? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keeping the science in mind while looking at the Blue Zones of Sardinia and Ikaria, we see a tradition of drinking wine with meals as part of an overall healthy lifestyle. Wine tends to be shared in social settings over food, which can limit amounts and slow the pace, easing the load as the body works to metabolize toxins. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think [red wine] is more linked to other positive eating and physical activity behaviors,” Piano said, pointing to a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2822215" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69603102e4b0120ab25c86df" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2822215" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that found a small protective association with preferences for wine and consuming alcohol with meals. This could be due to slower alcohol absorption, and it might reflect the lifestyle choices of people who prefer red wine as their drink of choice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There are just too many unknowns at this time, except that drinking too much (and that includes more than two drinks a day) is associated with a lot of adverse cardiovascular effects,” Piano said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even if there is a protective effect associated with wine, it has serious limits.

Be more intentional and mindful about what you’re drinking. … People need to understand what their risk is, and then it’s going to be up to them.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, if you are going to drink, is red wine the best choice? It’s possible that wine may have a slight edge over other types of alcohol due to its composition, but its main advantage probably lies in the traditions that surround it. Although there’s no definitive answer, one thing is clear: If you’re going to indulge in red wine, keep portions small, because healthy food and good company seem to be far more important for longevity than wine alone. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 12:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOYWUyNXQwWGNuYnk3enNFX254d0xoNTlDelo2dFhfS0swLTRaR0JGc2VodzJUZEpsZFVEQnc3eDByaHdFZVhnVWtMUUxpRmRfV0xJWmJSOExFUllWWFM5Q0tGcklXcE0zYlRaRTZ3SXVONlpmVWk4YmdhMFYwemxtZWxR0gGHAUFVX3lxTE14akppZ0dmekJEc09QMHZSa2NKeE5nZVZwN2lZb0k0c1RoOFRZWFVCbzcxSHRJWmxSRWRzSGN0QnR3anNiQkhCNkJIQU9zeWxXek1Rb0lhVmp5ZDVNQUwxUVhIYUNqQmxuSl9oSGV4T2g3RGh6Rk16cFlhNlBmVC00Y2lSa19KWQ</guid></item><item><title>成千上万的新泽西州儿童正在逃避接种疫苗。看看您所在的县如何比较。- nj.com</title><link>https://www.nj.com/healthfit/2026/01/thousands-more-nj-kids-are-skipping-vaccines-see-how-your-county-compares.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZNFXKOEOJVEO5F7N72WPHFECAM"&gt;Vaccination rates among New Jersey children continue to fall as religious exemptions rise, a trend that public health experts say may contribute to the resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EZV47YHO3VHYBFBA4MAJGKXCEA"&gt;Data from the state Department of Health shows 24,962 kids skipped vaccines for religious reasons during the 2024-25 school year, a nearly 25% increase from the previous year.

						&lt;p&gt;For many people over 50, there’s a common misconception that you need to workout longer and harder to see results. But the reality is that 60-minute or longer training sessions can feel draining, hard to recover from, and difficult to sustain long term. &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10854791/" target="_blank" data-citation="true" data-citation-type="ScholarlyArticle"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that as you age, your exercise recovery capacity changes. Muscle protein synthesis slows down, your joints become less tolerant of repeated high loads, and fatigue lingers longer than it did when you were younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that doing shorter bouts of resistance-based exercises on a regular basis can &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3790587/" target="_blank" data-citation="true" data-citation-type="ScholarlyArticle"&gt;increase muscle protein synthesis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12149312/" target="_blank" data-citation="true" data-citation-type="ScholarlyArticle"&gt;boost neuromuscular coordination&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10403822/" target="_blank" data-citation="true" data-citation-type="ScholarlyArticle"&gt;maintain strength&lt;/a&gt; in adults 50 and beyond. To learn more, we chatted with &lt;b&gt;James Bickerstaff, CPT&lt;/b&gt;, a personal trainer at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.origym.co.uk/blog/author/jbickerstaff/" target="_blank"&gt;OriGym&lt;/a&gt;, who shares a stellar 12-minute morning routine designed specifically for older adults to restore muscle faster than any hour-long gym session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Short morning routines that prioritize consistency, muscle activation, and recovery often outperform long workouts,” says Bickerstaff. “They stimulate muscle protein synthesis, improve joint lubrication, and boost circulation first thing in the morning, helping muscles recover and stay strong without unnecessary fatigue. This approach shifts the goal from exhaustion to activation, therefore preparing the body to move well throughout the day rather than draining it first thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following 12-minute routine is built around simple, compound movements that activate large muscle groups and support joint health. Read on for the exercises and detailed step-by-step instructions.

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sit-to-stand squats are top shelf squat variation for adults over 50 because they directly support a common daily task: getting up and down from a chair. They target the quads, glutes, and core while boosting balance and joint control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit upright on a sturdy chair with your feet shoulder-width apart and flat on the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scoot slightly forward so your weight is evenly distributed through your feet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flex your core while keeping your chest lifted and your spine neutral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive through your heels to stand up while squeezing your glutes at the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pause for one to two seconds in the standing position to maintain balance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly lower yourself back down to the chair over three to four seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightly touch the chair before repeating the next rep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform two sets of 12 to 15 reps, resting for 30 to 45 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="incline-push-ups-hands-on-wall-or-counter" class="o-slide-title" data-num="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Incline Push-Ups (Hands on Wall or Counter)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incline push-ups can help build and maintain upper-body strength while being far more joint-friendly than traditional push-ups. This push-up variation strengthens your chest, shoulders, triceps, and core while helping improve posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place your hands on a wall, countertop, or sturdy surface at chest height.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step your feet back slightly so your body forms a straight line from head to toe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage your core and glutes to prevent sagging through your lower back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly bend your elbows and lower your chest toward your hands over two to three seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your elbows angled slightly away from your sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your hands to return to the starting position in one controlled motion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reset your posture before beginning the next rep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete two sets of 10 to 12 reps. Rest for 30 for 45 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="bodyweight-rows" class="o-slide-title" data-num="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bodyweight Rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EIFEKZe4Wm8?si=UziQl2LJDab9pf5m" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bodyweight rows can help counteract the forward-rounded posture that often develops with age. They also strengthen your upper back, shoulders, and arms while boosting shoulder stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand facing a sturdy table or surface and grip the edge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk your feet forward and lean your body back with your arms fully extended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your chest upright and your shoulders relaxed away from your ears.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brace your core and pull your chest toward your hands by driving your elbows back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pause for one to two seconds then slowly lower your body back to the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain control throughout the entire range of motion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aim for two sets of 10 to 12 reps, resting for 30\ to 45 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="standing-march-with-core-brace" class="o-slide-title" data-num="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Standing March With Core Brace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This marching exercise variation will activate your hip flexors, glutes, and deep core muscles that support walking and daily movement while improving balance and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart and your arms relaxed at your sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flex your core by tightening your ab muscles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift one knee slowly toward hip height while keeping your torso upright.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pause for one to two seconds at the top to maintain balance and control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower your foot back to the floor with control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternate legs and repeat on the opposite side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid leaning back or rushing the movement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform two sets of 30 to 40 second holds, resting for 20 to 30 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="standing-hip-hinge-with-arm-reach" class="o-slide-title" data-num="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Standing Hip Hinge With Arm Reach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EzE6olH5n0E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This final movement incorporates your lower body, upper body, and core, helping to enhance coordination and mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold your arms straight in front of you at shoulder height.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hinge at your hips by pushing them back while keeping your spine neutral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower your torso slightly as your arms reach forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your weight balanced through your heels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squeeze your glutes to return to an upright standing position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reset your posture before repeating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete two sets of 10 to 12 reps. Rest for 30 to 45 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episodic_memory"&gt;episodic memory&lt;/a&gt; – the ability to recall past events and experiences – is known to decline as we age. Exactly how and why has remained something of a mystery, and a recent study goes some way towards solving it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by a team from the University of Oslo in Norway wanted to see whether this memory loss affects everyone equally, or if it might be driven by individual risk factors, such as the &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; ε4 gene &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-gene-may-be-responsible-for-over-90-of-alzheimers-cases"&gt;linked to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale of their analysis is impressive. The scientists combined data from 3,737 cognitively healthy participants, tracked over several years, including 10,343  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="189827" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scans and 13,460 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-name-new-type-of-memory-loss-often-mistaken-for-alzheimers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;memory assessments&lt;/a&gt;, from multiple long-running studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-may-now-know-why-alzheimers-erases-memories-of-our-loved-ones"&gt;We May Now Know Why Alzheimer's Erases Memories of Our Loved Ones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By integrating data across dozens of research cohorts, we now have the most detailed picture yet of how structural changes in the brain unfold with age and how they relate to memory," &lt;a href="https://www.hebrewseniorlife.org/news/new-mega-analysis-reveals-why-memory-declines-age"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Alvaro Pascual-Leone, from the Marcus Institute for Aging Research at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189830" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189830" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/BrainScans-1.jpg" alt="Brain scans" class="wp-image-189830 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/BrainScans-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/BrainScans-1-600x281.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189830" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked for links between brain structural changes and memory decline. (Vidal-Piñeiro et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Commun.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed a complex picture. While the hippocampus – a brain region central to memory and learning – was most significant here, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/dad2.12110" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;as expected&lt;/a&gt;, memory decline was not linked to changes in a single area alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reductions in brain tissue volume were linked to poorer episodic memory, which was not surprising, but the association was far from uniform. It became much clearer with age, especially in those older than 60, and was strongest in participants &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/male-brains-shrink-faster-than-female-brains-study-finds"&gt;whose brains were shrinking&lt;/a&gt; faster than average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those carrying &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-gene-may-be-responsible-for-over-90-of-alzheimers-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-gene-may-be-responsible-for-over-90-of-alzheimers-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-gene-may-be-responsible-for-over-90-of-alzheimers-cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; ε4 gene&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers observed a more rapid loss of brain tissue volume and decline in memory compared to other participants, but the general trajectory was the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cognitive decline and memory loss are not simply the consequence of aging, but manifestations of individual predispositions and age-related processes enabling neurodegenerative processes and diseases," &lt;a href="https://www.hebrewseniorlife.org/news/new-mega-analysis-reveals-why-memory-declines-age"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Alvaro Pascual-Leone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings raise plenty of questions and offer some answers, but overall they suggest that memory loss isn't necessarily a separate process from aging – and that the older we get, the more &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sitting-could-be-shrinking-your-brain-and-exercise-may-not-help" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;brain changes&lt;/a&gt; matter for memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also implications for treatments to slow or prevent memory loss: They'll need to target multiple brain areas, and may be most effective if started as early as possible. The good news is that the same therapies are likely to work for those with or without the &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt; ε4 gene, as the underlying mechanisms appear to be shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-found-an-early-signal-of-dementia-hidden-in-terry-pratchetts-novels"&gt;Scientists Found an Early Signal of Dementia Hidden in Terry Pratchett's Novels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's becoming clear that a variety of different factors can influence memory loss in later life, as part of a broader set of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/memory-problems-are-surging-in-adults-under-40-large-us-study-finds"&gt;cognitive capabilities&lt;/a&gt;.

Biological sex was considered in the study based on self-report. Gender was not considered in the study. Patients were 18 years of age or older with histologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC, cutaneous melanoma or uveal melanoma and measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0–2 was required. Previous treatment with palliative surgery or radiation was allowed. For the melanoma cohort, previous adjuvant anti-PD-1 was allowed provided the last dose occurred more than 6 months prior to enrollment. For the melanoma cohort, previous treatment with BRAF/MEK inhibitors was allowed. Major exclusion criteria included previous treatment with anti-PD-1 in the NSCLC cohort, a history of autoimmune diseases, active bowel disease, the use of daily corticosteroids &amp;gt;10 mg of prednisone or equivalent, symptomatic brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease. Patients were enrolled and treated at five academic centers in Canada: the Centre hopitalier de l’Université de Montréal (CHUM; Québec), the London Regional Cancer Program (LRCP; Ontario), the Centre hospitalier de l’Université de Québec (CHUQ; Québec), McGill University Health Centre (MUHC; Québec) and Lakeridge Health (Oshawa, Ontario). The research ethics board at each institution approved the conduct of the trial in accordance with current federal regulations, including the Canadian Food and Drug Regulations (C.05.001); the US Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR Part 56); International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Good Clinical Practice Guidelines; and the Declaration of Helsinki. The Unité d’Innovations Thérapeutiques at the CHUM was responsible for administrative functions, including the establishment of a DSMB, which provided safety oversight for the trial. Trial monitoring of the conduct of the trial and data management were performed by Ozmosis, Inc. All patients provided written informed consent and were able to withdraw consent at any time without compromising their cancer treatment. Patients were not financially compensated for their participation in this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec12"&gt;Ethics approvals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinical trial and correlative analyses were approved by the CHUM Ethics Review Board and each participating center (ethics number MP-02-2022-10121/21.173).

Stool aliquots were preserved at –80 °C in DNA/RNA Shield Buffer (Zymo Research) until processing. DNA extraction was performed using the DNeasy PowerSoil Pro Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s protocol. Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina DNA Prep (M) Tagmentation Kit (Illumina), following the manufacturer’s instructions, and purified with a 0.7× ratio of Agencourt AMPure XP beads. Sequencing was conducted on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell (Illumina) at the University of Trento’s in-house sequencing facility (Trento, Italy). Raw reads were processed through a quality control pipeline available at &lt;a href="https://github.com/SegataLab/preprocessing"&gt;https://github.com/SegataLab/preprocessing&lt;/a&gt;. In brief, reads were filtered out if they had low quality (&lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 20), were shorter than 75 bp or contained two or more ambiguous bases. Host-derived reads (human genome hg19 and Illumina spike-in phiX174) were also removed. On average, each sample yielded approximately 48 million high-quality reads. Five samples failed internal quality control and were excluded from downstream analyses. Taxonomic profiling was carried out using MetaPhlAn 4 (database version vJun23_CHOCOPhlAnSGB_202307). Of the 194 samples that passed quality control, 12 were excluded from the downstream analysis: 10 of excluded samples occurred during unscheduled visits, and two excluded samples were collected after salvage FMT. Because the salvage FMT typically involved a different donor, all samples occurring after the patient received salvage FMT were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec23"&gt;Statistical analysis for shotgun metagenomics sequencing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microbiome sequencing data were processed and analyzed using the phyloseq package (version 1.50.0). Taxonomic assignments and abundance tables were imported into a phyloseq object, including corresponding sample metadata. &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-Diversity analysis was performed using the vegan package (version 2.7.1), calculating richness and Shannon index. Principal component analysis was done with the packages prcomp (version 4.4.2) and factoextra (version 1.0.7), visualizing the variance explained by the principal components and the top contributing taxa. For the donor clusters unsupervised analysis, one sample from cluster A was removed from the visualization but included in the cluster calculation. PERMANOVA analysis was performed with 999 permutations using the ‘adonis’ function from the vegan package. Strain sharing between the patients and donors was calculated using StrainPhlAn4 with an in-house database for strain identification as previously published. Bray−Curtis dissimilarity was calculated between the samples and their corresponding donor samples using the ‘distance’ function from phyloseq. These distances were then adjusted to their corresponding baseline sample to observe the fold change over time. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) was performed to identify microbial taxa that differentiate between subject groups according to their response, cohort or toxicity development using the package yingtools2 (version 0.0.1.184).

Phylogenetic trees were generated for each SGB with StrainPhlAn4. The thresholds on normalized phylogenetic distances to define same-strain pairs were determined for each SGB separately by comparing the distances between pairs of longitudinal samples to the pairs of unrelated samples in the corresponding phylogenetic tree, and their separation was maximized with Youden’s index. Strain engraftment of an SGB was detected if the donor sample had the same strain of the SGB as the post-FMT sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec25"&gt;Calculation of SGB categories&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all patients with available corresponding donor shotgun metagenomic sequencing data, SGBs in each sample were categorized as follows: ‘Baseline’ for the SGBs unique only to the patient at their baseline sample; ‘Donor’ for the SGBs present in the sample that matched unique SGBs from the respective donor sample but were not found in the baseline sample; ‘Both’ for unique SGBs that were found in both the baseline sample and the matching donor sample; ‘New’ for SGBs not present in either the ‘Donor’ or the ‘Baseline’; and ‘Lost’ when SGBs that were identified at baseline were no longer present in the sample. To calculate the proportion of lost SGBs, we divided the ‘Lost’ SGBs by the total amount of SGBs present at baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec26"&gt;Pathway analysis from shotgun metagenomics sequencing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shotgun metagenomic samples were also processed with the HMP Unified Metabolic Analysis Network (HUMAnN3) pipeline (version 3.8).

Second, shared reads (reads that mapped with the same alignment score to multiple genes) were attributed according to the ratio of their unique mapping counts. For quantification of species, gene abundance was normalized using the fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads strategy (normalization by the gene size and the number of total mapped reads reported in frequency), and species abundance was determined from the average abundance of the first 100 core genes of each species provided in the annotation of the each million-gene catalog.

Species never seen at any timepoint were discarded. Species were then grouped by category and filtered for at least 10 observations—for example, seen in one of the categories for at least 10 patients. The proportion of patients with the species present at a given timepoint is called the species retention. The curve displaying species retention was obtained as the median of all retention values of the different species in a specific category, with 95% confidence intervals for median. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were calculated using the Mann−Whitney−Wilcoxon test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec30"&gt;High-throughput culturomics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-throughput culturomics was done as previously performed&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 63" title="Diop, K. et al.

A total of 0.3 g of stool from enrolled patients was resuspended in 1 ml of sterile 1× PBS. From this suspension, seven serial dilutions were prepared, and 50 µl of each dilution was plated onto 5% Columbia agar supplemented with sheep blood (COS; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Plates were incubated aerobically and anaerobically in an anaerobic chamber (5% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 90% N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) at 37 °C for up to 72 hours. Anaerobic conditions were achieved using sealed Zip bags (Becton Dickinson) containing GasPak anaerobic generators (Becton Dickinson). In parallel, enrichment cultures were performed by inoculating 200 µl of stool suspension into BD BACTEC Lytic/10 Aerobic (Becton Dickinson) for aerobic conditions. For anaerobic conditions, BD BACTEC Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F (Becton Dickinson) and Yeast Casitone Fatty Acids Broth with Carbohydrates (YCFAC) were used. All broth cultures were supplemented with 5% defibrinated sheep blood and 5% filtered rumen fluid (0.22 µm). At multiple timepoints (24 hours, 3 days, 7 days, 10 days, 15 days, 21 days and 30 days), serial dilutions from enrichment broths were plated on COS agar and incubated under the same aerobic and anaerobic conditions. After incubation, isolated colonies were subcultured onto fresh COS agar and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 72 hours. Colonies were then purified and subjected to identification. Bacterial identification was performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). For each isolate, a double spot was deposited onto a 96-spot MSP target plate, overlaid with 1 µl of a saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix solution (prepared in 50% acetonitrile and 2.5% trifluoroacetic acid) and allowed to dry. Spectra were acquired using a MicroFlex LT/SH mass spectrometer (Bruker) and analyzed via FlexControl version 3.4 and MALDI Biotyper Compass version 4 software. Identification was achieved by comparison to the Bruker MBT Compass BDAL reference library and an in-house spectral database. Colonies yielding identification scores higher than 1.9 were considered reliably identified at the species level. Isolates with scores lower than 1.9 were further analyzed by whole-genome sequencing for taxonomic assignment. Bacterial species detected in patient samples at baseline were compared to those identified 1 month after FMT. Due to lack of donor samples available for culturomics, we used the corresponding donor shotgun metagenomics sequencing sample. Species detected at baseline but absent at the 1-month post-FMT timepoint were classified as lost. Conversely, bacterial species present in both the donor sample and the recipient 1 month after FMT—but not detected in the patient at baseline—were defined as engrafted from the donor. Engraftment from the donor versus lost from baseline was compared using the non-parametric Mann–Whitney &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;-test using GraphPad Prism (version 10.4.2) software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec31"&gt;Metabolomic analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty microliters of plasma was mixed with 500 μl of ice-cold extraction solution (methanol:water, 9:1, v/v, at −20 °C) containing isotopically labeled internal standards. The mixture was vortexed for 5 minutes at 2,500 rpm to ensure thorough homogenization and efficient extraction of endogenous metabolites. Samples were then centrifuged at 15,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 minutes at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were collected and aliquoted into multiple fractions to be analyzed by different liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC−MS)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 64" title="Grajeda-Iglesias, C. et al.

Targeted detection of polyamines and bile acids was performed by LC−MS/MS using a 1290 Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) system (Agilent Technologies) coupled to a 6470 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (QQQ 6470) (Agilent Technologies). For polyamine quantification, 10 μl of extract was injected into a Kinetex C18 analytical column (150 mm × 2.1 mm, 2.6-μm particle size; Phenomenex), equipped with a C18 guard column (5 mm × 2.1 mm). The column was maintained at 40 °C using a Peltier oven. Chromatographic separation was achieved using a binary mobile phase consisting of (A) water with 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA) and (B) acetonitrile with 0.1% HFBA, both freshly prepared. The initial mobile phase composition was 95% A and 5% B, followed by a linear gradient to 30% B over 7 minutes. The column was washed with 90% B for 2.25 minutes and then re-equilibrated with 5% B for 4 minutes. The autosampler was maintained at 4 °C. Mass spectrometry parameters included gas temperature of 350 °C, gas flow rate of 12 l min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and capillary voltage of 2.5 kV. For bile acid analysis, 10 μl of sample was injected onto a Column Poroshell 120 EC-C8 1,200 bars (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.9-μm particle size; Agilent Technologies), protected by an XDB-C18 guard column (5 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.8 μm). The column was also maintained at 40 °C. The mobile phase consisted of (A) water with 0.2% formic acid and (B) acetonitrile:isopropanol (1:1, v/v), both freshly prepared. Initial conditions were 70% A and 30% B, followed by a shift to 38% B over 2 minutes, maintained for an additional 2 minutes. A rapid gradient from 38% to 60% B was applied over 30 seconds. The column was washed with 98% B for 2 minutes and re-equilibrated at 30% B for 1.5 minutes. Autosampler temperature was kept at 4 °C. Instrument parameters were set with gas temperature of 310 °C, gas flow rate of 9 l min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and capillary voltage of 4.5 kV. In addition, pseudo-targeted metabolomic profiling was performed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry (UHPLC−HRAM) on a Dionex U3000 UHPLC system coupled to a Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), as previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 65" title="Durand, S. et al.

All targeted treated data were merged and cleaned with a dedicated R package (@Github/Kroemerlab/GRMeta). We applied the ComBat function from the sva R package (sva version 3.52.0) to correct for inter-batch effect. Batches were divided into two groups. The batch correction model included a design matrix preserving the biological signal from key clinical covariates. Clinical features associated with samples included age, gender, body mass index (BMI), tumor type and time of first dose of ICI. ComBat was applied on log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;-transformed AreaQCCorr values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec32"&gt;Statistical analysis for metabolites&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolite longitudinal data were analyzed using generalized additive models (GAMs) with the mgcv R package (version 1.9-3) using the ‘gam’ function. Each metabolite was fitted with a GAM model that included the two groups (R and NR) present in the study. Before applying any model, data were cleaned by removing individuals with only one timepoint of analysis and duplicated samples. After cleaning the dataset, this metabolite analysis comprised 100 samples from 35 patients, each having at least two timepoints sampled (from two to four). Data normalization was performed before model fitting. Metabolite intensities were transformed using square root normalization with the ‘sqrt’ function from R base (version 4.5). Individual GAMs were fitted for each metabolite with the following model structure:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="u-list-style-none"&gt;

                &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time was modeled with penalized splines. The effective degree of freedom (edf) indicates the complexity of the time curve. In the fitted models, edf values excedeed 1, which is consistent with a nonlinear pattern. Model performance was assessed by calculating root mean squared error to evaluate model accuracy deviance explained and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to assess how much the model explained the signal variance, along with residual analysis and concurvity assessment. Temporal evolution was evaluated from the fitted group-specific time smooth across the entire observation window. Reported &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values are the significance tests for these time smooths, assessing the null hypothesis of no within-group time effect (flat curve). Temporal evolution was evaluated through model outputs and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value. Between-group differences were calculated using the ‘difference_smooths’ function from the gratia package (version 0.10.0) to compute differences between R and NR smooth curves with 95% confidence intervals. Figures displaying temporal evolution were created using smooth estimates calculated with the ‘smooth_estimates’ function from the gratia package. Both trajectory and difference plots were generated using the ‘ggplot’ function from the ggplot2 package (version 3.5.2) and combined using the ‘plot_grid’ function from the cowplot package (version 1.1.3). &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were displayed using the ‘ggsignif’ function from the ggsignif package (version 0.6.4). Data manipulation was performed using the dplyr package (version 1.1.4) and tidyverse (version 2.0.0). All analyses were conducted in R (version 4.5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec33"&gt;Bio-Me qPCR assay&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used Precision Microbiome Profiling (PMPTM) (Bio-Me), which is a validated qPCR method for analyzing the gut microbiome composition, based on TaqMan technology on the OpenArray format (Thermo Fisher Scientific). This assay targets 108 bacterial species and subspecies (107 bacteria and one fungal species). Standard curves for the assays were created using reference materials quantified by fluorescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Reagent). The reference materials were acquired from the Leibniz Institute DSMZ or the American Type Culture Collection. Standard curves for each qPCR assay were used to convert the quantification cycle (Cq) value into number of genomic copies per microliter of sample; this number was transformed into normalized absolute quantification. qPCR was performed on 220 samples in total (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 181 patients and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 39 donors), and only patient samples with corresponding SGB category information were included in the final analysis (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 104 samples). Quantitative PCR and metagenomics relative abundance were visualized using the ComplexHeatmap package in R, and a Kendall score Kendall’s &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt; was computed using the ‘cor.test’ function in the ‘stat’ package using pairwise complete observations. Spearman′s &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; correlations were performed using GraphPad Prism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec34"&gt;Olink proteomics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiplex high-throughput proteomics was performed using the Immuno-Oncology Panel (Olink) and analyzed per the manufacturer’s instructions. All Olink data are reported as linearized normalized protein expression (NPX), per the manufacturer’s instructions. Olink data were visualized in R using the OlinkAnalyze package using ‘olink_umap_plot’ using manyfold approximations and projections using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and ‘olink_volcano_plot’. For volcano plots, Benjamini−Hochberg-corrected &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec35"&gt;Quantification of 16S PCR&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to assess the relative abundance of total bacterial DNA in stool samples by targeting the V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene.

Subsequently, for each patient, separate .fcs files were generated for each of these nine populations. The percentages of all subpopulations were then determined through manual gating using FlowJo version 10.8.1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec41"&gt;Murine experiments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee at the Centre de Recherche du Centre Hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal (CRCHUM) and carried out in compliance with Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines (ethical protocol C22017Br). Murine experiments were conducted using 7-week-old female wild-type C57BL/6 SPF-reared mice obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Mice received 3 days of antibiotics solution containing ampicillin (1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), streptomycin (5 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and colistin (1 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) (Sigma-Aldrich), which was added to the sterile drinking water of mice before FMT. Three consecutive FMTs, using patient feces (ethics approval was obtained (MP-02-2022-10121/21.173, MP-02-2018-7132/17.035 and 16.161)), were performed at day −15, day −14 and day −13 (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41591-025-04186-5#Fig4"&gt;4i&lt;/a&gt;). FMT was performed by thawing fecal material, and 200 µl of the suspension (100 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) was then transferred by oral gavage. An additional 100 µl was applied on the fur of each animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks after the first FMT, mice were implanted subcutaneously with 0.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; MCA-205 cells. When tumors reached 25−35 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in size or 35−45 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in size for anti-PD-1 monotherapy and anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 experiments, respectively, mice were treated four times intraperitoneally every 3 days with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (250 μg per mouse; Bio X Cell, clone RMP1-14) or anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody plus anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody (100 µg per mouse; Bio X Cell, clone 9D9). Additionally, the mice received a 200-µl gavage of NaCl or bacterial cocktail group starting 3 days after the tumor implantation and at each treatment. Tumor sizes were measured with manual calipers. The mice were euthanized 2 days after the last treatment. Experimental groups were compared using the Mann−Whitney−Wilcoxon test in GraphPad Prism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec42"&gt;Bacterial cocktail group preparation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For murine experiments, bacterial cocktails were prepared as follows. Bacterial strains used in the murine experiments were isolated from patients at baseline enrolled in the FMT-LUMINate clinical trial and stored at –80 °C. Bacteria were cultured from frozen stocks on fastidious anaerobe agar plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, PB0225A) for 48 hours at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions. Prior to cocktail formulation, the identity of each isolate was confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS. After identification, bacterial colonies were collected, resuspended in sterile NaCl and adjusted to an optical density of 1.0, corresponding to approximately 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec43"&gt;Cell culture, reagents and tumor cell lines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;MCA-205 fibrosarcoma cells, class I MHC H-2b syngeneic cell lines for C57BL/6 mice, were used for this study and obtained from Jonathan Stagg’s laboratory. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 100 UI ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin−streptomycin. All reagents were purchased from Gibco-Invitrogen. Cell lines were checked for mycoplasma using PlasmoTest Mycoplasma Detection Kit (InvivoGen).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec44"&gt;Statistical analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All statistical analysis and visualization were done in R or GraphPad Prism (version 10.4.2). &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were considered statistically significant if &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05, and all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were two-sided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec45"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41591-025-04186-5#MOESM2"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt; linked to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 10:39:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE1zVkRTZjNuYmtTODlhazkxcFVCSW1lV3ZjcVI4Yl9EYVptVW1aaWVYQjExcDJRWElsZ0xHM0JPWVptQmtCQTBfSUQ3Q3hwNUlOd2l1Y2cxYkR0VnlDWkg4</guid></item><item><title>视频展示了金毛猎犬在没有皮带的情况下行走时的动作- DogTime</title><link>https://dogtime.com/news/204588-golden-retriever-walking-without-leash-video</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is absolutely understandable to be nervous about unhooking your dog’s lead in the middle of a snowy field. But Maria, who posts her &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever"&gt;Golden Retriever’s&lt;/a&gt; life on @hudsonstaysgolden, clearly has way more faith in her pup than most people. Hudson is usually busy being a school therapy dog in the NJ area with his teacher mom. So he’s basically a professional at keeping his cool even when the world is a giant marshmallow. In this video, she decides to ditch the leash entirely to see what happens. Spoiler alert: Hudson emerges as the goodest boy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-golden-retriever-listens-to-owner-even-while-walking-without-a-leash"&gt;Golden Retriever listens to owner even while walking without a leash&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the clip opens, we see Hudson in his full winter gear: boots, coat, the whole nine yards, and he is just beaming. Like, the dog cannot stop smiling. On-screen text says, “I took off my dog’s leash…” and your brain immediately prepares for chaos. But then she stops walking. And Hudson stops too. He just halts right next to her like that was always the plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, Mom asks him to smile. And he actually does it. He makes his face even wider. It’s the cutest thing ever, and it’s no wonder the post has over 5.2k likes already because the sheer focus he has on his mom is just… wow. One person in the comments was literally like, “ma’am I think I’m in love with your dog,” and yeah, join the club.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, the text flashes, “He did run off…” which feels like a fake-out until it finishes with “…when I asked him to like this.” Hudson zooms to a nearby tree, loops around it perfectly, and comes straight back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He tries doing a “bridge” on command, too. But there isn’t enough space. And then he gets a treat for doing all of it, obviously. That’s when we see the best part about this video and the Golden Retriever without a leash. Hudson runs around happily in the snow, carrying a massive stick. One person in the comments from the UK said he literally cures their gloomy weather blues. And that’s a big compliment for this boy who loves to leave people happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

By February, however, those goals are often forgotten. That busting of best intentions begs the question: &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01200-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01200-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;how much exercise&lt;/a&gt; do people really need, and what’s the ideal way to get it? Recent research fortunately has some welcome advice for the time-stressed in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01200-7" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00237-0/d41586-026-00237-0_27075652.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Why is exercise good for you? Scientists are finding answers in our cells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing guidelines from most national and global health organizations call for at least 150–300 minutes of moderate physical activity each week, or 75–150 minutes of vigorous activity, for healthy adults, sometimes alongside activities to strengthen muscle and bone. Although those guidelines remain good goals to aim for, newer studies suggest that meaningful health benefits emerge with much less exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are getting a clearer understanding of the bare minimum amount of exercise needed for health gains thanks to data from wearable devices. These can provide more-reliable measurements than do self-reported data, which form much of the basis for current guidelines. By incorporating wearables into study design, researchers can collect accurate data on physical activity minute by minute, says I-Min Lee, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts. “And this is when we start to see that even low levels of physical activity are helpful,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data are redefining what counts as physical activity and could push future recommendations towards lower targets. But a potential shift in guidelines needs to be considered carefully in terms of the message it might send, says Emmanuel Stamatakis, a researcher specializing in physical activity and population health at the University of Sydney, Australia. No one wants to suggest that people shouldn’t strive to move more, especially when an estimated 31% of people worldwide don’t meet existing recommendations&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and physical inactivity contributes to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03143-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03143-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;health problems such as obesity&lt;/a&gt; and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re in a bit of an awkward situation because if we are to take the wearable-based evidence at face value, we will have to release guidelines that will be recommending lower amounts” of minimum physical activity, says Stamatakis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way in which wearables are changing thinking is by helping to quantify daily inactivity, which might be just as important as how much a person exercises. Some guidelines are already incorporating caps on sedentary time. “Especially if you work from home, you can do very little exercise in a day. It’s quite scary,” says Carol Maher, an exercise researcher at the University of South Australia in Adelaide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The more, the better — up to a point&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s exercise recommendations are born from large epidemiological studies that compare disease and death rates between those who are more and less physically active. Whereas previous guidelines had focused on enhancing athletic performance and relied mostly on studies in young and fit male medical students, studies beginning in the 1980s followed larger groups of people over many years and included women and older people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such studies have consistently shown that physical activity offers strong protection against cardiovascular disease, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00720-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00720-6" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;reduces the risk of several types of cancer&lt;/a&gt; and lowers the risk of death from any cause, as well as having &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02225-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02225-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;mental-health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. Although observational studies can be limited by potential bias — those who exercise might be healthier to start with — researchers go to great lengths to mitigate this problem. Studies tend to control for variables such as age, smoking status, alcohol consumption and body weight, and adjust for family history of cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03687-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03687-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;postmenopausal hormone use&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01402-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01402-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;sleep duration&lt;/a&gt; and other factors. Some studies exclude participants diagnosed with cardiovascular disease or cancer and those who do not engage in any physical activity. Some also exclude the first years of observation, so that participants with as-yet-undiagnosed diseases can be identified over time. The biases alone cannot explain the findings, says Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03596-2" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00237-0/d41586-026-00237-0_51687774.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Alzheimer’s decline slows with just a few thousand steps a day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2011 meta-analysis found that people who met the recommendation of 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week — defined as movement that raises heart and breathing rates — had a 14% lower risk of coronary heart disease than those who reported no physical activity in their leisure time&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Such moderate activity, during which the exerciser can still talk but would struggle to sing a song, includes brisk walking and light cycling. Those who exercised even more, about 300 minutes a week, had a 20% lower risk than those who didn’t exercise. Heart benefits continued to increase with more exercise, although gains tapered off at higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, even people exercising for half the recommended 150 minutes a week showed heart-disease risk reductions that were almost the same as for those who met the guideline. The authors concluded that “the biggest bang for the buck for coronary-heart-disease risk reduction occurs at the lower end of the activity spectrum: very modest, achievable levels of physical activity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar pattern emerges for risk of death (see ‘Movement matters’). A 2022 study analysing 30 years of data from 116,221 adults found that those who did 150–300 minutes of moderate physical activity each week had a 20–21% lower risk of all-cause mortality during the study period than those with almost no moderate activity&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Smaller amounts were already beneficial: 20 to 74 minutes of moderate activity a week resulted in a 9% lower risk of death. People who exercised up to about 600 minutes a week — four times the recommended minimum — had an extra 10–11% reduction in risk. But going beyond that didn’t provide further benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00237-0/d41586-026-00237-0_51974440.png?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00237-0/d41586-026-00237-0_51974440.png?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="MOVEMENT MATTERS.

Those participants spent, on average, 2.2 minutes a day in this type of activity&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A big part of the benefit comes from going from doing nothing to doing something,” says Leandro Rezende, an epidemiologist at the Federal University of São Paulo, Brazil, and a co-author of the 2022 study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to vigorous physical activity — the type of movement that makes speaking difficult, such as cycling uphill or running — as little as 15 minutes each week can be enough to reduce the risk of death. A prospective study, reported in 2022, that followed participants for almost six years revealed that this modest effort resulted in an 18% lower mortality risk over the study period&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The analysis adjusted for how much light and moderate physical activity the participants did overall, as well as other underlying health conditions that could affect their capacity to do vigorous exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies using different measures of physical activity come to similar conclusions about &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03596-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03596-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;the benefits of minimal exercise&lt;/a&gt;. A 2019 analysis — which adjusted for factors such as self-rated health and family history of diseases — concluded that, among older women, taking 4,400 steps a day (far below the 10,000 steps that many people aim for) is already associated with a lower mortality risk&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Benefits levelled after 7,500 steps a day. Although there isn’t an exact correspondence between number of steps and minutes of activity, another study using accelerometer data from around 3,500 people found that those who reached 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in a week typically accumulated around 7,000 steps a day (including from intentional exercise and everyday activities)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise snacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introduction of wearables opened the door to studying exercise sessions that are shorter than 10 minutes, as well as lighter physical activity. Stamatakis is among those who began investigating the effect of short bursts of vigorous activity in people’s daily routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says that he has loved movement since his childhood in Greece, when he spent hours playing football after school. The idea of studying how people can enhance their health with everyday movement occurred to him around 2008. Living in Brighton, UK, he grew sick of the local traffic. “I sold my car, and I started walking everywhere and cycling everywhere,” Stamatakis recalls. “It felt so liberating. It felt so nice. I felt more connected with my community. From that point on, I started converting this into a scientific interest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03632-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00237-0/d41586-026-00237-0_51939902.png"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How much protein do you really need?

Beyond these well known benefits, tea consumption is also linked to brain protection, reduced muscle loss in older adults, and anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. Together, these findings point to tea as a beverage with broad potential to support long-term health. At the same time, the review highlights important concerns related to certain modern tea products, particularly bottled and bubble teas, which may include artificial sweeteners, preservatives, and other additives.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tea is produced from the leaves of Camellia sinensis and has been consumed worldwide for centuries. It was first used mainly for medicinal purposes before becoming a widely enjoyed daily drink. Researchers have long been interested in tea because it contains high levels of polyphenols, especially catechins, which are believed to play a key role in its health effects. The review examines tea's influence on multiple health outcomes using evidence from laboratory research as well as human studies. While green tea has been studied extensively, much less is known about the health effects of other varieties, including black, oolong, and white tea, particularly when comparing their benefits. The review also considers potential risks tied to additives and contaminants found in some commercially produced tea beverages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Highlights Gaps in Current Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were published in &lt;em&gt;Beverage Plant Research&lt;/em&gt; by Mingchuan Yang &amp;amp; Li Zhou's team, Tea Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The authors emphasize that additional research is needed to more clearly define both the benefits and possible risks of tea consumption across different populations and tea types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Tea Affects the Heart, Metabolism, and Weight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the review, green tea stands out for its protective effects on the cardiovascular system. Studies show it can help lower blood pressure and improve cholesterol levels. Large cohort studies also suggest that people who regularly drink tea have a lower risk of death from all causes, reduced rates of CVDs, and a decreased likelihood of developing certain cancers. Tea may also play a role in weight management and diabetes control. Evidence indicates that green tea catechins can support weight loss and improve metabolic markers in individuals with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Health and Muscle Preservation in Aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tea consumption is also associated with benefits beyond heart and metabolic health. Research suggests that regular tea drinkers, particularly older adults, show lower rates of cognitive decline and fewer biomarkers linked to Alzheimer's disease. In addition, tea catechins may help slow age-related muscle loss. This effect could support better muscle strength, physical function, and overall performance in seniors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Risks From Processed Tea Products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite tea's many advantages, the review cautions that not all tea products offer the same health value. Bottled teas and bubble teas often contain added sugar, artificial sweeteners, and preservatives that may weaken or offset tea's natural benefits. The authors also note concerns about pesticide residues, heavy metals, and microplastics found in tea. While these contaminants are not considered a significant risk for most people at typical intake levels, they may be more relevant for individuals who consume large amounts of tea over long periods. The review also discusses how tea can interfere with the absorption of certain nutrients, including non-heme iron and calcium, which may be important for people following vegetarian diets or those with specific nutritional requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freshly Brewed Tea Offers the Most Benefit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the review concludes that tea provides clear health benefits, especially when consumed in its traditional, freshly brewed form. Moderation is advised when it comes to processed options like bottled tea and bubble tea due to their added sugars and preservatives. The authors suggest that regular, moderate intake of brewed tea may help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. They also note that future studies examining long-term consumption, differences among tea varieties, and the impact of contaminants will be essential for refining guidance on tea's health effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

"What if, instead, during the premonitory phase of an attack, you're sensitive to scent, you notice smells that you wouldn't normally." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Goadsby has analysed &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ene.12451" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;the brain scans of migraine patients&lt;/a&gt; who feel that light triggers their attack and compared them to patients who don't tend to blame light for the onset of their pain. Only the former had overactivity in the part of the brain responsible for vision right before their migraine, suggesting that, during that moment, they were biologically primed to be more sensitive to light than their counterparts. "Unquestionably, something is going on biologically," says Goadsby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But the quest to discover what that underlying biological mechanism has been a long one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;&lt;span id="the-genetic-origin-of-migraine" class="sc-d16436d-0 gCPVhV"&gt;&lt;b id="the-genetic-origin-of-migraine" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;The genetic origin of migraine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://headachejournal.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/head.14789" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;Studies on twins&lt;/a&gt; show that there is a strong genetic component and that if your &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0333102419828989" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;parents or grandparents had migraine&lt;/a&gt;, you're statistically likely to inherit the neurological condition too. Inherited genes appear to play a role in an &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1474442224000267" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;estimated 30-60%&lt;/a&gt; of people who suffer from migraine, with other cumulative external factors such as life history, environment and behaviour accounting for the rest, says Dale Nyholt, a geneticist at Queensland University of Technology in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Nyholt is screening thousands of people to find the exact genes running amok, but the quest has been "more complex than what we were ideally hoping for", he says.

    &lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first week of January, the Health and Human Services Department, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., released two arguably important public health announcements. The first was an overhaul of the childhood vaccine schedule. Going &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2026/01/19/rfk-childhood-vaccines-lawsuit"&gt;outside of the normal processes&lt;/a&gt; for such changes, Kennedy removed many vaccines from the list of those the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends for kids, including shots to prevent hepatitis B, influenza, rotavirus, and several other illnesses.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second announcement, just two days later, was a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/dietary-guidelines-health-agriculture-federal-nutrition-2d8fa56be3c5900fc45116af7c69d786"&gt;new set of dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, which the government updates every five years. The new guidelines are much more concise than previous versions but largely provide similar advice. They focus on the importance of whole foods (“real food,” as Kennedy calls it), recommend consuming protein and vegetables, and urge limiting sugar and processed foods. There are some updates relative to prior editions, including more emphasis on full-fat dairy products and meat protein sources, and a higher level of recommended protein intake. The sugar restrictions are also tighter.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    


&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on existing scientific data, one of these announcements represents a dangerously wrong turn in public health, and the other is at least fine and arguably positive advice well worth following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, the changes to the vaccine schedule are not based on scientific evidence. I’ve &lt;a href="https://parentdata.org/what-changed-in-childhood-vaccine-schedule/"&gt;written on this elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;, so I won’t belabor the point, but there is no reason to remove these vaccines from the schedule. There are no new safety concerns, and no change in the evidence of their safety and effectiveness. And the vaccines are beneficial. The new guidelines remove the flu vaccine from being universally recommended for children. This is despite the fact that this vaccine is typically 70 percent to 90 percent protective against hospitalization, and the 2024-25 flu season marked the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm"&gt;highest number of children’s deaths&lt;/a&gt; from the flu since 2004. Although the reduction in the number of recommended shots does not prohibit parents from having their kids get them, the changes made in the vaccine schedule will result in an erosion of trust in vaccines more broadly and more children dying of preventable diseases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the new dietary guidelines largely reflect what we already know from the data about a healthy diet. They are, in fact, similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf"&gt;previous guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, which covered more than 150 pages and seemed aimed more at nutritionists than typical Americans, but are condensed into just nine pages. Shortening and simplifying those guidelines is a hugely positive change. A core issue with the dietary guidelines is that most people do not follow them. Americans consume far more sugar, for example, than guidelines suggest and far fewer vegetables. A food pyramid with frozen pizza and cookies at the top would be a more accurate depiction of &lt;a href="https://parentdata.org/what-americans-actually-eat/"&gt;how people eat&lt;/a&gt;. Making dietary recommendations simpler isn’t magic, but it might make it more likely that people change their behaviors.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give an example: Both the old and &lt;a href="https://cdn.realfood.gov/DGA.pdf"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; guidelines urge parents to introduce allergens to their babies early to lower the risk of developing food allergies. In the old guidelines, the details of this are buried on page 58; in the new ones, they are front and center, one of a small number of guidelines about baby feeding. This is better public health communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t to say there aren’t issues with the new guidelines—just as there were issues with the previous ones. A good example is milk. The old guidelines recommended low-fat or nonfat milk as being better for preventing obesity; however, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31851302/"&gt;the data overall&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t strongly support that. The new guidelines say full-fat milk is better; the data &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t support that. Any milk is fine! The new guidelines focus on animal fats (beef tallow, anyone?) over seed oils like canola oil. There is no evidence to suggest animal fats are any healthier, and it’s just an opportunity for influencers to promote their niche products. The new guidelines’ protein recommendations are more than the average sedentary American requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But overall, based on a combination of adherence to reliable data and user-friendly design, I would argue the revamped guidelines are not just adequate but an improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not alone in seeing the difference between the vaccine schedule changes and the new dietary recommendations, and having the Trump administration announce them in close succession has raised a key question for people interested in communicating health information to the public. Many &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/aap-opposes-federal-health-officials-unprecedented-move-to-remove-universal-childhood-immunization-recommendations/"&gt;organizations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/a-unilateral-change-to-childhood"&gt;individuals&lt;/a&gt; believe this administration’s approach to vaccines is an existential threat to public health. As a result of Kennedy’s moves targeting vaccines, these groups and people—I count myself among them—spend a lot of time trying to counter anti-vaccine narratives. We try to give people information that will maintain or restore their trust in vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this goal in mind, it’s easy to know how to react to the vaccination announcement: oppose it, and describe in detail why. It’s much harder to know how to respond to the dietary guidelines coming out of the same administration with the same leader in charge of public health. His vaccine skepticism, and the damage it has caused, somehow makes it harder to embrace his views on healthy eating. The core question: If I want people to listen when I say that you should ignore what RFK Jr. says about vaccines, what should I say about his department’s pretty reasonable advice on diet? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could convey that these dietary guidelines are more of the same misinformation as the vaccine changes. I could focus on the new guidelines’ advice for consuming red meat (if you ate what they suggest, you’d be way over the saturated fat guidelines), on the oddly sized food pictures in the pyramid, or on the beef tallow (a fringe food fad). I could characterize it all as just more of the crazy RFK Jr. nonsense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upside of this approach is that it maintains the justifiable position that Kennedy’s views on public health are not to be trusted; the downside is that it isn’t the most honest take on the evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other option is to try to draw a clear distinction between the two announcements, suggesting that the dietary guidelines may be fine while maintaining that the changes to the vaccine schedule are not. The upside of this is that it is an honest take on the evidence. The downside is that it suggests a level of trust in &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; decisions by Kennedy and his advisers, which could be perceived as an endorsement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my own work, I choose the second option. When these dietary guidelines came out, I wrote largely favorably about them &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/opinion/dietary-guidelines-protein.html"&gt;in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And I &lt;a href="https://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2026/01/grading-rfk-jr-on-the-harvard-college-curvehttps://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2026/01/grading-rfk-jr-on-the-harvard-college-curve"&gt;came under criticism&lt;/a&gt;, largely from the left, for effectively “sanewashing” the administration. I believe this criticism is wrong. But it did reveal something fundamental about trust: It is very hard to build, and when you lose it, it is almost impossible to regain. When it comes to public health, the Trump administration’s actions have made it all too easy not to trust it.&lt;/p&gt;

These factors include four health behaviors -- diet quality, physical activity, sleep duration and nicotine exposure -- and four health factors, including blood pressure, body mass index, blood sugar and blood fat levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"These are the factors the American Heart Association has identified as cardiovascular disease risk factors," Kristen Knutson, associate professor of neurology and peventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine specializing in sleep and circadian rhythm research and fellow at the American Heart Association, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Different people will have them in different combinations, but they are all correlated with one another," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Stock photo of a person reading their mobile phone in bed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh YxlyB "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Adobe Stock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Evening people were 79% more likely to have poor overall heart health compared with those in the intermediate group, the study found. Morning people did slightly better than the intermediate group, with a 5% lower risk of having a poor LE8 score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Researchers found the evening people had a 16% higher risk of both heart attack and stroke. Researchers estimated that about 75% of this higher risk was explained by other LE8 factors, rather than sleep timing alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It isn't being a night owl that's a problem," Knutson said. "I think being a night owl who's trying to live in a morning lark's world is a conflict between one's internal clock and their social clock."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The higher risk appeared to be due to certain lifestyle behaviors and other health factors, the study found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Nicotine use had the strongest impact on heart health, explaining 34% of the link between late bedtime and heart disease. Shorter sleep duration accounted for 14% of the extra risk, high blood sugar for 12% and body weight and diet each accounted for about 11% of the increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Behavioral effects of being a night owl were stronger in women than in men -- women were 96% more likely to have lower LE8 scores compared to 67% in men, though they did not have a higher risk of heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Women are further stressed by that lifestyle because they're having to still get up and be the primary caregiver for family members," Dr. Sonia Tolani, preventative cardiologist, Associate Professor of Medicine, and co-director of the Columbia University Women's Heart Center, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the U.S., according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers concluded prevention efforts should focus on improving lifestyle habits when spending more time awake at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The most obvious way is to quit smoking and that's not new advice," Knutson says. "But sleep regularity, meaning trying to go to bed at about the same time every day and not jumping around the clock -- particularly on days off -- can really help lead to regular timing of other behaviors like light exposure, meals, exercise activity." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Prioritize the low-hanging fruit" recommended Tolani. If an hour at the gym is not doable, "maybe you can find a way to do a 10-minute walk or cut a little bit of salt from your diet. Just try to make small changes," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Dr. Joseph Wendt is a public health and preventive medicine resident at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 07:38:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOS2p1Q1Awa2FXMVM0S1hfdGFYMU5HTTNVOWFtN3Z1dXphU2tpeUtEMkpSZnZrZ21KTHhad2d2bmtZWjFzNTdsR0p1UlpqWHYxa19hdklUQ3NRUVV5STcxNlVhdVNUNkQ3S1RkS3AyT0swZV9sUUpNaVU1eGFtaUltWjRDb0llWEdaY0ZzbVlhbDF3dmlDT3VhVjQzdUd4SDNwUXfSAacBQVVfeXFMT3ZDdzZ0MFZjdEQ1RGlvMnVsM0pLRDBsMTA0blBKU2taOVAzbUk2c3ZjYV9OdHZuMkxpVEpvbnNvQXlvTlJjeHVFMWhMaDAwTXlUcDl6bFp1eWw5WWkwQ3NtdkxZcjhpa3YtRXRRbXFkLXBnMmh0dzNadEVKVTFEVWtlLXRzcW14NmxTVmktUm54bmtVUG1kM0R5ZG1kS2NFSkY3R1l4UDA</guid></item><item><title>印度表示，随着一些亚洲国家加强健康检查，它已遏制了尼帕病毒的爆发-美联社新闻</title><link>https://apnews.com/article/india-nipah-virus-outbreak-contained-asia-166df6c637780b99ede380bf4ddccfcc</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="LeaderBoardAd-Mobile "&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (AP) — Indian authorities said they had contained a Nipah virus outbreak after confirming two cases in the eastern state of West Bengal, as several Asian countries tightened health screenings and airport surveillance for travelers arriving from India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India’s Health Ministry said Tuesday that two Nipah cases had been detected since December and that all identified contacts had been quarantined and tested. The ministry did not release details about the patients but said 196 contacts had been traced and all tested negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The situation is under constant monitoring, and all necessary public health measures are in place,” the ministry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nipah, a zoonotic virus first identified during a 1990s outbreak in Malaysia, spreads through fruit bats, pigs and human-to-human contact. There is no vaccine for the virus, which can cause raging fevers, convulsions and vomiting. The only treatment is supportive care to control complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The virus has an estimated fatality rate of between 40% and 75%, according to the WHO, making it far more deadly than the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There were no reported cases of the virus outside India, but several Asian countries introduced or reinforced screening measures at airports as a precaution. The safety measures were put in place after early media reports from India suggested a surge in cases, but health authorities said those figures were “speculative and incorrect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia and Thailand increased screening at major airports, with health declarations, temperature checks and visual monitoring for arriving passengers. Thailand’s Department of Disease Control said thermal scanners had been installed at arrival gates for direct flights from West Bengal at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Myanmar’s Health Ministry advised against nonessential travel to West Bengal and urged travelers to seek immediate medical care if symptoms develop within 14 days of travel. It said fever surveillance introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic at airports has been intensified for passengers arriving from India, with laboratory testing capacity and medical supplies readied.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Vietnam’s Health Ministry on Tuesday urged strict food safety practices and directed local authorities to increase monitoring at border crossings, health facilities and communities, according to state media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China said it was strengthening disease prevention measures in border areas. State media reported that health authorities had begun risk assessments and enhanced training for medical staff, while increasing monitoring and testing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier Nipah outbreaks were reported in West Bengal in 2001 and 2007, while recent cases have largely been detected in southern Kerala state. A major outbreak in 2018 killed at least 17 people in Kerala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;——&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associated Press journalists across Asia contributed to this report.&lt;/p&gt;

Brief movement breaks restore shear stress, support vessel relaxation, and help prevent arterial stiffening. Regular activity lowers systolic blood pressure by about 4 to 8 mm Hg, a key driver of long-term arterial health.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Get natural light daily&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Getting daily sunlight exposure helps regulate the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/doctor-explains-how-circadian-rhythm-affects-heart-and-metabolic-disease-risk-timing-plays-a-major-role-101765801354066.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="circadian rhythm"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn supports healthy day-night blood pressure patterns and overall cardiovascular balance. Dr Sood explains, “Daylight stabilises circadian rhythms, which supports normal day-night blood pressure patterns, including the protective nighttime dip. Disrupted circadian BP rhythms are linked to greater vascular damage and cardiovascular risk. Consistent daylight exposure indirectly supports healthier arterial pressure cycles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Practice slow, controlled breathing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Slow, controlled breathing has a calming effect on the nervous system and can help lower systolic &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/blood-pressure" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="blood pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, potentially reducing pressure-related stress and injury to the arterial walls over time.&lt;span&gt; The physician highlights, “Slow breathing shifts autonomic balance toward parasympathetic tone, reduces sympathetic drive, and improves baroreflex sensitivity. This can lower systolic BP by about 5 mm Hg on average, reducing pressure-related injury to arterial walls over time.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eat a variety of colourful foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Including a wide variety of colourful plant foods can support better heart health, as they provide an array of vitamins, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/golden-dome-critical-minerals-trump-backs-down-on-greenland-but-remains-insistent-on-his-wishes-101769050192920.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="minerals"&gt;minerals&lt;/a&gt;, and bioactive compounds that work together to protect blood vessels and support cardiovascular function.&lt;span&gt; Dr Sood emphasises, “Colorful plant foods provide potassium, fiber, and bioactive compounds that support endothelial function and blood pressure regulation. Dietary patterns rich in fruits and vegetables, such as DASH or Mediterranean-style eating, consistently lower BP and slow arterial stiffening.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wind down from screens before bed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the physician, using screens before bedtime can interfere with sleep quality and disrupt the body’s natural night-time blood pressure regulation. He explains, “Late screen use prolongs cognitive and autonomic arousal, disrupts sleep, and blunts the normal nighttime BP dip. Sustained nocturnal pressure increases arterial strain. Protecting sleep supports healthier overnight vascular recovery.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vbmg002y26p55jxz75vd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            How a person will be diagnosed with mental illness could look significantly different in the near future.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx8eq0s00013b6prpxmov5h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Psychiatric Association announced Wednesday that it is radically reconceptualizing the main manual that clinicians use to make a mental health diagnosis. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders will get a new name, new voices shaping its content and a new approach that will add more layers to a diagnosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx8qpkf00033b6pzob84lr4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The hope is that it will turn what some call “psychiatry’s bible” into more of a guidebook to mental health disorders — one that’s more inclusive, dynamic and educational, so patients will receive more effective treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg0006336pu2s8rkea@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A mental health disorder impacts an individual’s thoughts and behavior and can cause ongoing distress or impair their ability to function. Why someone has a particular mental health disorder can vary, stemming from a complicated mix of brain chemistry, genetics, life experience and a person’s environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg0007336pnlt1egiv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unlike with an infection, where doctors can use an objective blood test to pinpoint the bacteria or virus causing the problem, there are few simple tests to determine what kind of mental health disorder someone has.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx8zkhg00053b6pl11id3dt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So, psychiatrists created the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,&lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/what-is-the-dsm" target="_blank"&gt; commonly known as the DSM&lt;/a&gt;, to categorize mental health disorders, create diagnostic criteria and provide descriptive text to help professionals make an appropriate diagnosis based on their observations of a patient’s symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx8dtvx00003b6p9ag5d6vt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than half of all people will experience a psychiatric disorder in their lifetime, research shows.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx9puw7000e3b6p1sj7bum7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Putting a label on a mental health disorder is essential so that clinicians know how to treat a patient. The DSM is also important for practical reasons, like billing and insurance purposes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg0008336pvmbl9kxa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Used by more than just psychiatrists, the DSM is considered the very foundation of how mental health issues are understood. The DSM gives patients, researchers, insurance, lawyers and others a common language to identify particular mental health issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg0009336przm4i2xq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The current edition, DSM-5-TR, contains more than 300 distinct mental disorders such as schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder and alcohol use disorder.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx938i400073b6pws6i9vpq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While APA updates the manual regularly to reflect the most up-to-date science, the last update was 2022. Over the years, the DSM has come under heavy criticism. Some argue it’s not scientific enough, others argue it’s not specific enough, or even practical.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx93zjh00093b6pn017t07v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So, to improve the manual, the APA turned to an unlikely source for inspiration: its critics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000a336pohkcy4iv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The critics are loud, so it’s very hard to ignore them,” joked Dr. Maria Oquendo, chair of APA’s Future DSM Strategic Committee.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx96f7l000b3b6p2b3egz33@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Oquendo said the APA spoke with several to get a better sense of how the DSM could be improved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000b336p7im0nbt4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We don’t have ownership of all the best ideas, and if they’re out there, we want to hear them,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000g336p4c2crymj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the first things APA said it will change is the manual’s name. Going forward, DSM will stand for Diagnostic Science Manual of Mental Disorders.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx9t9zl000p3b6pqezsy9m7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the APA first created the DSM in the 1950s, many people were institutionalized, Oquendo said. Public policy makers who funded mental institutions wanted to keep track of the number of people with particular disorders, but in an era of deinstitutionalization, numbers aren’t as important.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000h336pca3zpime@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To create the DSM, the APA pulls together hundreds of experts from around the world who discuss definitions and treatments. There are also field trials and tests. One of the bigger changes going forward is that the APA will invite people with a lived experience of a particular diagnosis to sit on the APA’s committees and shape diagnostic descriptions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000i336pdhsgt18v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another change is to take more of a person’s life into consideration when a clinician gives a diagnosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx9z8hj000r3b6peqqz4l9r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The traditional focus of the DSM has been on observable characteristics and symptoms — in other words, “the way things appear, rather than on their underlying mechanisms,” said Dr. Jonathan Alpert, the vice chair of the Future DSM Strategic Committee.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000j336pe791nn40@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Psychiatric disorders, as we’ve come to understand them, reflect a complex interplay of really, all features of the human condition, environmental, socioeconomic, cultural, developmental as well as biological factors,” said Alpert, who also chairs the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Montefiore’s Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000k336pargsaknl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new approach will not necessarily replace a particular diagnosis, like opioid use disorder. Rather, it would add another layer to the diagnosis that will take into account more contextual experience.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx9sfv8000m3b6pxwex0533@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For instance, if someone’s been mistreated as a child, that can have a profound impact on their psychiatric illness, said Dr. Diana Clark, who is the APA’s senior director of research. Factors that impact mental disorders “don’t occur in a vacuum,” Clark said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkxardy600143b6pnlou0qtx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A person’s background and experience have always been a part of diagnosing a mental illness, but foregrounding it will “help the clinician look at the person as a whole and not just at the symptoms.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000m336pu3vdphey@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            How to make the proposed changes practical is something the APA is still trying to figure out, Clark said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000n336pd73ejyxz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We know we need to be brief so the clinician can use it, but in also doing anything that’s brief, we know that can also lead to some kind of oversimplification,” Clark said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000o336ps009p5bb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Biological factors are also something the APA wants to incorporate better into the DSM. While there is no genetic test for obsessive compulsive  disorder yet, the hope is to make the DSM flexible enough to incorporate technology that may not exist yet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000p336pusd7ocjv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve reached a stage in psychiatry where the question is really no longer whether biomarkers belong in the DSM, but really how to introduce them in a way that is something transparent, ethically and clinically useful,” Alpert said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000q336p26fa9nj2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The APA also wants to make it so that a diagnosis has more flexibility, said Oquendo, who also chairs the Department of Psychiatry at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkxasz4100163b6p5n3ggx6u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For instance, a patient may turn up in the ER with a mental health problem, but if a doctor only has 15 minutes to assess the problem, a doctor may feel compelled to pick a diagnosis, even if it isn’t completely clear. The APA hopes to create diagnostic categories that can lead to less specific labels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000s336prp7rf46b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is no timeline to make these major changes to the DSM. Changes often can take years, but the APA said it’s already having conversations with insurance companies about this shift.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000t336pwk6m4vbz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Categorizing mental health disorders is not easy, said Dr. Daniel Morehead, a psychiatrist who is not working on the DSM project.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000u336pfb5e9o9u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The most complex physical object in the universe that we know is the human brain, and so we’re not going to put it into a few neat little categories,” said Morehead, who is a program director of the Adult&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Psychiatry Residency Program at Tufts Medical Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000v336p7c1put77@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Morehead hopes the APA will make the DSM a much more dynamic document that takes more of the whole person into account, not just their symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkxb22lj00183b6p1snq5wqa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s very hard to do,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000w336p4i48fu92@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Oquendo said she believes the APA is up to the task.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkx7vzeg000x336pu6ujte7s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think we will not only be pragmatic, but also scientifically rigorous and forward thinking,” she said. “We have to do it right so it might take a little bit of time, but we’ll try and do it as fast as possible because the field is ready for it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;The diagnostic manual known as "the Bible of psychiatry" is about to get a major overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/" target="_blank"&gt;American Psychiatric Association&lt;/a&gt; (APA) puts out the tome known in the field as the DSM-5. That stands for the &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/dsm" target="_blank"&gt; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The APA outlined its thinking and approach for the next revision in five studies published Wednesday in &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/journal/ajp" target="_blank"&gt;The American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Instead of a weighty volume, the next DSM will be "a living document" online and easier to update. The APA hasn't set a strict timeline and hasn't decided yet if it will be called the DSM-6 or some new name. But it is seeking input from a broad range of both mental health professionals and people who have psychiatric conditions. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The DSM is really the foundational framework for mental health diagnosis," said &lt;a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g332/p8936060" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Maria Oquendo&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the Strategic Committee in charge of the future of the manual, speaking at a press conference announcing the research supporting the new approach.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The DSM is used by psychiatrists, psychologists, physicians, researchers, and insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's very useful in the sense that it helps you think about what is going on with the patient in a hopefully accurate way," says &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1205956968/jennifer-havens" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jennifer Havens&lt;/a&gt;, chair of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. "Because the essential thing you have to do in any illness is diagnose it. And if you make the right diagnosis, you prescribe or initiate the right treatments."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Keeping it current &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the past, the DSM has been revised every 15 years or so, with the DSM-5 published in 2013. "Each revision reflects advances in science, clinical practice and sociocultural understanding," said Oquendo.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But that lengthy process and making it available in a print format has had limitations, according to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitin-gogtay-m-d-4889ab45/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Nitin Gogtay&lt;/a&gt;, deputy medical director of the APA, who also spoke at the virtual press conference.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Clinicians and other stakeholders may lack uniform and timely access to the most current evidence that might delay translation of new discoveries into the practice," he said. "We want this process to be as current as possible."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Keeping the next edition primarily online means it can be updated more regularly to reflect recent scientific developments in diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addressing critiques of the DSM &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many of the other changes to the manual are intended to incorporate scientific advancements in understanding of mental disorders, their diagnoses and treatment, and address common criticisms of the current DSM.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There are many critiques out there," said Oquendo. "And perhaps the most salient one is the fact that the DSM doesn't reference what the causes of mental disorders are."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's a fairly standard approach in medicine to try to understand the causes of an illness," says Havens, who isn't involved in revising the manual. "If you understand the causes of the illness, maybe you can prevent it. It absolutely affects your treatments."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But because the underlying causes of mental illnesses are complex — involving an interplay of genetics, biology, one's environment and life experiences — and there were conflicting ideas about causes in past decades, past DSMs left them out. (The DSM-5 acknowledged potential causes under "Risk and Prognostic Factors.". )&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Not accounting for causes can harm diagnoses and treatment plans, says Havens. Take for example, the lasting impact of childhood traumas on people's mental health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Trauma causes a significant amount of the mental illness that we see in everybody," she says. "And it increases the vulnerability of people who are going to have serious, persistent mental illness like schizophrenia tremendously. And it's part of the problem in the field that we don't understand that enough as a cause and we don't intervene enough. "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Today, researchers know a lot more about the factors that cause or exacerbate mental illnesses. And that will be factored into future DSMs and approaches to prevention of mental health symptoms in different populations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Oquendo says things like living in poverty, or near environmental toxins, or being part of a religious or cultural minority who faces additional daily stressors can all affect mental health negatively.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So, future DSMs will emphasize factors that influence mental health symptoms and outline approaches to prevention of symptoms in different populations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This would be a "sea change in psychiatry," says Havens.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The role of biological markers&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since the publication of DSM-5 there have been significant advances in understanding the biological roots of mental health disorders. Those advancements have brought scientists closer to discovering biological markers for various disorders.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They might be blood tests; they might be neuro imaging tests. They might even be digital tests from wearable devices or cognitive testing that are meant to measure biological processes that might underlie mental disorders," says Dr. Jonathan Alpert, vice chair of the Future DSM Steering Committee of the APA and head of psychiatry at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One area where the Food and Drug Administration has already approved tests for biomarkers is for Alzheimer's disease, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There are blood tests and tests of cerebrospinal fluid that look at some of the proteins," Alpert says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another kind of biological marker in the near future may be certain markers of inflammation for people with major depression.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"A subset of people with major depressive disorder, also called clinical depression, have elevated measures of inflammation, and that can be picked up even by a blood test of C-reactive protein (CRP)," says Alpert. CRP is a marker for inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Those people seem to respond preferentially well to anti-inflammatory agents either by themselves or in addition to more standard antidepressants like SSRIs," like Prozac and Lexapro.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Discussions of who can benefit from such testing within the population of people with major depression may be in a future version of the DSM.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Lived experience voices &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For now, the APA is putting its thinking and overall strategy out into the world for feedback from the public, including health care providers, advocates and people living with mental illnesses. They want this next version to be informed by a wider circle of people than just psychiatrists.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"There's a strong recognition that there were not enough voices included in our prior iterations of this document," says Dr. Tami Benton, who leads child and adolescent psychiatry at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and is a member of the DSM strategic committee. "There's going to have to be greater inclusion of individuals who are affected — people with lived experience, including adolescents and their families and children and their families."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NPR</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNTHJkRTFJNnFzalJtLWVhNkp3dThITkRIdkVkTmh0Z2xUZXdsVV92Tkk2ZFJMNnhua21yemRVa014cnNSa0lLeEd1Y0lPdnprZHljaTVtYmVhM0NZU0psODNCWHdsU0Nyd3l5S3NJLW1lRkpGdGw4RXJ5ek1hR2FIVlhJck02MEcxNjlLbUdZQmVnbmpxTHlDWDVXZ1g5THgtMG94MGVEdFZOR3F4</guid></item><item><title>骨科医生敦促每个人每天做一次伸展运动，以消除长时间坐着造成的损伤-只需三分钟- Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/flexibility/an-osteopath-urges-everyone-to-do-this-one-daily-stretch-to-undo-the-damage-caused-by-prolonged-sitting-it-only-takes-three-minutes</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;

&lt;p id="86c843eb-7add-4867-a529-c063019efcf0"&gt;There is no single remedy that will reverse the damage done by prolonged sitting, says associate osteopath Andy McIntyre BOst MSc from &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelivewellclinic.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelivewellclinic.co.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;The Livewell Clinic&lt;/a&gt; in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But there are two areas that, for me, take the biggest brunt from sedentary postures,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="86c843eb-7add-4867-a529-c063019efcf0-2"&gt;The first one is the hips, which he says can be addressed by practicing gentle hinging movements like good mornings and deadlifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other pain point tends to be the "mid thoracic" area. This refers to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Thoracic_Anatomy" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Thoracic_Anatomy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;middle section of the spine&lt;/a&gt;, around the T1 to T12 of the vertebrae between the neck (cervical spine) and lower back (lumbar spine).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We all hunch forward when sat at a desk,” McIntyre explains. “We get kyphotic. Our shoulders drop forward. Our mid and upper back rounds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compensate, these vertebrae can stiffen, which further restricts the range of motion for everyday tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our bodies are very clever. To adapt to this [hunched position] joints stiffen up in our mid-back so we require less energy to hold ourselves there all the time,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-2t9ws4RCHEFPe7gPGVTeTW" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-2t9ws4RCHEFPe7gPGVTeTW slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we then come to use our shoulders, when we come to run, when we do anything else, that stiffness is still there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the shoulders and other parts of the spine, like the neck, have to compensate and work harder to do basic things, like look over our shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just like how we decondition our hips by being at a desk, we are deconditioning our thoracic spine all the time when sat forward in this hunched position.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-mobilize-the-thoracic-spine"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-mobilize-the-thoracic-spine"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to mobilize the thoracic spine &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="82c8a20a-f006-4ec7-aa45-4073844ae098"&gt;To arrest and reverse this deconditioning, McIntyre says we should all be working on thoracic extension and rotation in order to “undo the damage from being chained to a desk all the time”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the best ways of unlocking extension is through thoracic rotation,” he says. “If our spine can rotate, then it will be able to do all the other planes of motion much more easily.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For McIntyre, that means practicing an exercise called open the book first thing in the morning and last thing at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If extra time allows, he also performs the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/flexibility/im-a-personal-trainer-and-this-is-the-one-move-i-recommend-to-open-up-your-mid-back" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/flexibility/im-a-personal-trainer-and-this-is-the-one-move-i-recommend-to-open-up-your-mid-back" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/flexibility/im-a-personal-trainer-and-this-is-the-one-move-i-recommend-to-open-up-your-mid-back"&gt;thread the needle&lt;/a&gt; exercise, which similarly targets the thoracic spine—though he favors the open the book exercise if he had to choose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best moves for thoracics are anything that involves rotation either flat to a mat or flat to a wall,” says McIntyre, because it will “force us to bias our thoracic spine”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do those [two exercises] pretty much every day and though I’m not at a desk as much as some people can be, even I notice the stiffness quite significantly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-do-the-open-the-book-stretch"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-the-open-the-book-stretch"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do the open the book stretch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="youtube-video youtube-facade" data-nosnippet id="OW6YHlxY6JI"&gt;

You want the pelvis and knees to be fixed to the floor, so all the movement comes from the thoracic spine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McIntyre says it helps to follow your hands with your gaze. “Look over your shoulder to follow that arm. That helps encourage rotation through your entire thoracic spine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the morning, McIntyre does three sets of one minute on each side, but if you’re just starting out you can begin with just 30 seconds each side, so three minutes in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-person-2t9ws4RCHEFPe7gPGVTeTW-JJePntKrh7flboQy1O5UMnp2mDwPN436" class="slice-container person-wrapper person-2t9ws4RCHEFPe7gPGVTeTW-JJePntKrh7flboQy1O5UMnp2mDwPN436 slice-container-person"&gt;&lt;div class="person person--separator person--strapline"&gt;&lt;span class="person__strapline"&gt;About our expert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="person__heading"&gt;&lt;span class="person__strapline-inline"&gt;About our expert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="person__name-socials"&gt;&lt;span class="person__name"&gt;Andy McIntyre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;nav class="button-social-group person__social-buttons" aria-labelledby="button-social-group- person__social-buttons"&gt;&lt;p id="button-social-group- person__social-buttons"&gt;Social Links Navigation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="button-social   " href="https://www.thelivewellclinic.co.uk/%20" target="_blank" aria-label="WEBSITE"&gt;&lt;span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"&gt;&lt;svg class="icon-website" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 1000 1000"&gt;&lt;path d="M1000 500A501 501 0 0 0 503 0h-6A501 501 0 0 0 0 500c0 275 223 499 498 500h4a501 501 0 0 0 498-500zM529 936V765h133c-31 90-79 154-133 171zM337 765h134v171c-54-17-101-81-134-171zM61 539h176a899 899 0 0 0 22 167H110a439 439 0 0 1-49-166zM471 64v191H331c31-101 82-173 140-191zm199 191H529V64c58 18 109 90 140 191zm270 226H763c-1-59-7-115-18-167h155a438 438 0 0 1 40 167zm-235 0H529V314h156a857 857 0 0 1 19 167zM471 314v167H296a859 859 0 0 1 19-167h156zM237 481H60a438 438 0 0 1 41-167h154a921 921 0 0 0-18 167zm59 58h175v167H320a837 837 0 0 1-24-166zm233 167V539h175a831 831 0 0 1-24 167H529zm234-166h176a436 436 0 0 1-49 166H741a893 893 0 0 0 22-166zm104-285H731c-20-68-47-126-81-169a443 443 0 0 1 217 169zM350 86c-33 43-61 101-81 169H133A443 443 0 0 1 350 86zM148 765h127c20 59 45 110 75 150a442 442 0 0 1-202-150zm502 150c30-39 56-91 75-150h127a442 442 0 0 1-202 150z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="person__bio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy McIntyre B.Ost (Bachelors of Osteopathy) is an osteopath registered with the General Osteopathic Council, who works at &lt;a href="https://www.thelivewellclinic.co.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;The Livewell Clinic&lt;/a&gt; in Clapham Junction, London. Having originally worked as a software developer, he changed his career towards sports massage and osteopathy, training at the London School of Osteopathy, and has since explored further training in 3D movement analysis and postural assessment to better assist his clients. He works with the generally desk-bound public as well as more highly-trained athletes to help get them out of pain and into better movement patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Understanding these microscopic messengers could change the fight against metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventing cancer from spreading throughout the body is the goal of our team at the Department of Electrical Engineering at the École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with Prof. Julia Burnier and biology specialists at the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre, we are working to understand how cancers transform into metastases; in other words, how they invade other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-hidden-warning-sign-discovered-in-the-gut-may-increase-cancer-risk"&gt;A Hidden Warning Sign Discovered in The Gut May Increase Cancer Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For about eight years, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-91873-5"&gt;my team has been studying&lt;/a&gt; lipid nanoparticles, which are barely 100 nanometers in size and invisible to the naked eye. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ads5249"&gt;Our first task is to understand&lt;/a&gt; the path of metastasis. Then we try to determine different ways to inject drugs into the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipid nanoparticles, such as liposomes, differ from conventional approaches to cancer treatment because they deliver drugs directly to tumour cells. That increases their effectiveness and reduces toxicity compared to conventional chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38543294/"&gt;Researchers have demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; that liposomes target tumours more effectively and reduce side effects, while &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8069739/"&gt;others have observed&lt;/a&gt; that these nanomedicines improve the penetration and specificity of treatment, particularly in the case of metastases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results confirm that nanomedicines can make cancer treatments more targeted, more effective, and improve their tolerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_190383" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-190383" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Lipid-nanoparticle-structure-on-black-background-642x361.jpg" alt="Illustration of a blue and purple sphere, showing intricately detailed structures inside it" class="wp-image-190383 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Lipid-nanoparticle-structure-on-black-background-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Lipid-nanoparticle-structure-on-black-background-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Lipid-nanoparticle-structure-on-black-background-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Lipid-nanoparticle-structure-on-black-background.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-190383" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Lipid nanoparticles deliver drugs directly to tumour cells. (Tumeggy/Science Photo Library/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tiny particles responsible for spreading&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every cell in our body, whether healthy or cancerous, releases tiny particles called extracellular vesicles. These small bubbles, made of lipids and proteins, also carry genetic information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a cancer cell releases its vesicles into the bloodstream and they are transferred to a healthy cell, they can alter its DNA and turn it into a cancer cell. This is how cancer spreads to other organs, such as the liver. This mechanism is the basis of metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is, extracting and studying these natural vesicles is a long and difficult process. To speed up our research, my team produces artificial copies called liposomes using small devices called micromixers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mixing different solutions – lipids, proteins, water, and ethanol – our research team creates particles that resemble natural vesicles. The challenge is then to understand which lipids and proteins are contained in extracellular vesicles in order to produce liposomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then inject these liposomes into liver cancer cells to see how they react. The more the cells retain these particles, the more it proves that the copies mimic reality well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a typical experiment, liposomes are manufactured with precise parameters to reproduce the size and charge of extracellular vesicles. They are also made visible by staining them with a fluorescent marker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These liposomes are then incubated with cancer cells grown in our laboratory. This makes it possible to film and measure, in real time and without disturbing the cells, how and at what speed the liposomes are absorbed and expressed by the cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results show that the more the liposomes resemble natural vesicles in size and charge, the more effectively they are absorbed. This allows us to see how their chemical and physical composition influences how they are absorbed by cells and their possible role in tumour development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Observing the behaviour of liposomes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to understand how these extracellular vesicles are transported to liver cells to create metastases. The main challenge is to ensure that these liposomes can truly mimic extracellular vesicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are currently achieving a 50 per cent efficiency rate for protein encapsulation. We aim to increase this to 90 per cent. We hope this will enable us to explain how metastases form so that we can block them. Once the technique has been refined, our team will conduct tests on rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long term, this work could be a game-changer for many patients by preventing the formation of metastases and increasing their chances of survival. Our goal: to understand and block metastases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Towards new treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our team seeks not only to understand the process, but to develop new weapons against cancer. The idea is to use these liposomes as tiny shuttles that can transport drugs directly to cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diameters of the liposomes differ depending on the cancerous organ to be treated. Therefore, it's very important to properly characterize and understand the properties of these liposomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, researchers are currently testing the encapsulation of turmeric, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2024.1399888"&gt;which has been studied for its anti-cancer properties&lt;/a&gt;. Our team is doing the same to observe how cancer cells react to these liposomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's thought that turmeric, and more specifically the curcumin it contains, helps fight cancer by slowing the growth of tumour cells and promoting their destruction by the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34572272/"&gt;Many studies&lt;/a&gt; have confirmed its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, which can enhance the action of cancer treatments. By encapsulating turmeric in liposomes, we are improving its ability to reach and target diseased cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Unlocking the secret of cancer spread&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to this molecule, other molecules such as paclitaxel are already used in cancer treatments in liposomal form. Encapsulated paclitaxel improves drug delivery and tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also innovative strategies that use liposomes to transport small pieces of DNA or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="190368" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; that act as messengers, which help the body to better detect and fight diseased cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These approaches have been validated in &lt;a href="http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37047585/"&gt;several scientific studies&lt;/a&gt; and are already being used in certain cancer treatments, with new advances being made every year to improve their effectiveness and safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-3d-print-material-deep-inside-the-body-using-ultrasound"&gt;Scientists '3D Print' Material Deep Inside The Body Using Ultrasound&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using liposomes to replicate the body's natural vesicles emanating from cancer cells, our team hopes to unlock the secret of how cancer spreads and determine effective approaches to block it. Our research paves the way for more targeted treatments that can prevent metastasis and improve patient survival rates.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/271593/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

When the gene producing OTULIN was removed completely, tau disappeared – it was no longer being produced at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, this tau removal didn't seem to affect the health of the neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/switching-off-one-crucial-protein-appears-to-reverse-brain-aging-in-mice"&gt;Switching Off One Crucial Protein Appears to Reverse Brain Aging in Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons from a donor with Alzheimer's were compared with neurons grown from  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="189623" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; taken from healthy donors, which showed that both OTULIN and tau were more abundant in the neurons affected by the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pathological tau is the main player for both brain aging and neurodegenerative disease," &lt;a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/unm-researchers-discover-new-master-regulator-of-tau-a-protein-implicated-in-many-neurodegenerative-diseases"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; molecular geneticist Karthikeyan Tangavelou, from the University of New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you stop tau synthesis by targeting OTULIN in neurons, you can restore a healthy brain and prevent brain aging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189626" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189626" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/OTULINFeatures.jpg" alt="OTULIN features" class="wp-image-189626 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/OTULINFeatures.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/OTULINFeatures-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189626" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers discovered new roles for OTULIN in RNA metabolism and gene expression.

Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of disrupting or removing OTULIN as a treatment to slow brain aging is unfeasible, at least for the foreseeable future. Both the enzyme and tau play key roles in our body's functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the researchers point out, any kind of OTULIN restriction would need to be carefully managed in order to avoid causing damage elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We discovered OTULIN's function in neurons," &lt;a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/unm-researchers-discover-new-master-regulator-of-tau-a-protein-implicated-in-many-neurodegenerative-diseases"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Tangavelou. "We don't know how OTULIN functions in other cell types in the brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, these are interesting and rather surprising findings that could prove incredibly useful in future research. One of our best chances at treating Alzheimer's seems to be in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-natural-molecule-may-help-clear-buildup-of-alzheimers-proteins-study-finds"&gt;removing the harmful protein build-up&lt;/a&gt; that comes with it.

Not only was tau production stopped, but the activity of dozens of other genes was impacted, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These genes were mostly associated with inflammation, the researchers found, suggesting that OTULIN can play a key role in neuron stress, and wear and tear on the brain when it's not operating as it normally should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, this all has to be tested in animal and human models, but scientists now potentially have another target to aim at when developing treatments for Alzheimer's and other related diseases.

Are you heterosexual? It can even be as extreme as worrying are you a paedophile?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt; "A really common one is intrusive thoughts about contamination and worries about getting ill or spreading sickness," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;OCD most commonly begins in puberty or early adolescence, but some people are diagnosed later in life as they can "go years masking or covering up the distress," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Research suggests there may be a genetic component to developing OCD as well as links to early life stress such as bullying, bereavement or family breakdown, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Chartered psychologist Kimberley Wilson says almost everyone experiences intrusive thoughts at some point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Research suggests around &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211364914000128" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;80% of us have these thoughts&lt;/a&gt;," she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;For most people, those thoughts pass quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We can look at them, think they're weird, and put them aside," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If you're unable to dismiss the thoughts, that's when you may need to seek help, she suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"OCD-related thoughts don't pass on, they take up residence and they're never positive thoughts - they're aggressive, hostile and not easy to deal with.

"Recognising 'I'm having an intrusive thought' creates distance and remind me that it's not me," she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some people also find it helpful to visualise OCD as something separate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Drawing what OCD looks like can help - there's me and there's OCD, and those are two different things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Self-care also matters. "Eating well, resting and physical activity can help as my  OCD is always worse when I'm stressed and not looking after myself," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Today, Nina still lives with OCD but has learned how to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I've never got over OCD, but I can function with it. I now have mild intrusive thoughts and a lot of insight into how I manage it.

			&lt;p&gt;Calling ingredients with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/healthy-foods-you-should-be-eating-real-superfoods-2018"&gt;multiple health benefits&lt;/a&gt; 'superfoods' may be more of a marketing gimmick than a scientific category, but a recent review on bamboo's health benefits certainly suggests the plant might be worthy of the name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international team of researchers analyzed past studies involving a mix of human trials and lab studies to weigh up effects linked to eating the grass's shoots and other products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there were lots of associated benefits: improvements in metabolic and digestive health, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/anti-inflammatory-diets-are-all-over-tiktok-heres-what-the-science-says"&gt;reduced inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and cell toxicity, and reduced risk of a number of diseases were among the many pluses of bamboo consumption mentioned by the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-were-wrong-about-restrictive-diets-decades-of-research-says"&gt;We Were Wrong About Restrictive Diets, Decades of Research Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The findings from our systematic review, which included 16 studies, suggest that if appropriately prepared, the consumption of bamboo may have multiple health benefits for humans," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bamboo.2025.100210"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was already known that bamboo is high in protein and fiber, low in fat, and packed with &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-bamboo"&gt;plenty of nutrients&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="190156" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt;. However, this is the first time that all the available science on bamboo in diets has been analyzed collectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_190159" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-190159" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/BambooShoots.jpg" alt="Bamboo shoots" class="wp-image-190159 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/BambooShoots.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/BambooShoots-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-190159" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Bamboo shoots are how the plant is most often used in food. (Wulingyun/Moment/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One potential benefit of adding a few bamboo shoots to your stir-fry could be an improvement in glycemic control (blood sugar regulation), which can lower the risk of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="190156" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-may-have-discovered-a-natural-alternative-to-ozempic"&gt;help manage it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another of the reviewed studies, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcdf.2024.100431"&gt;bamboo was shown&lt;/a&gt; to have probiotic-boosting effects, meaning that it increases levels of healthy live bacteria in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the review also acknowledges that there are potentially toxic ingredients in bamboo, and the plant must be made safe before eating. Studies analyzed here also showed issues with lead levels and swelling of the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23188-thyroid"&gt;thyroid gland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bamboo is already commonly eaten in parts of Asia, and it has huge potential to be a healthy, sustainable addition to diets worldwide – but it must be prepared correctly," &lt;a href="https://www.aru.ac.uk/news/study-suggests-bamboo-has-superfood-potential"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Lee Smith, a professor of public health at Anglia Ruskin University in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The multiple health benefits we identified, including its potential to tackle modern health challenges like diabetes and heart disease, are likely due to the nutritional content of bamboo and its extracts, with bamboo rich in proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review reinforces the potential of bamboo, with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-to-live-to-100-these-four-habits-might-help-get-you-there"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt; that are numerous and varied. At the same time, it's clear that more research is needed into the impacts that bamboo has on our bodies. Many of the studies in the review were relatively small or were limited to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.9739"&gt;experiments in the lab&lt;/a&gt; rather than in living people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's actually titled as a 'call to action' study – one intended to encourage further research. With larger and more detailed investigations, we should find out just how high the ceiling is when it comes to bamboo as a superfood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our review shows bamboo's clear promise as a possible superfood, but there are also gaps in our knowledge," &lt;a href="https://www.aru.ac.uk/news/study-suggests-bamboo-has-superfood-potential"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We could only find four studies involving human participants that met our criteria, so additional high-quality human trials are necessary before we can make firm recommendations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bamboo.2025.100210"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advances in Bamboo Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;“Damning”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, a lack of updated data can make it more difficult, if not impossible, for federal and state health officials to identify and rapidly respond to emerging outbreaks. It can also prevent the identification of communities or demographics that could benefit most from targeted vaccination outreach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-05527"&gt;an accompanying editorial&lt;/a&gt;, Jeanne Marrazzo, CEO of the Infectious Disease Society of America and former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, stated the concern in starker terms, writing: “The evidence is damning: The administration’s anti-vaccine stance has interrupted the reliable flow of the data we need to keep Americans safe from preventable infections. The consequences will be dire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study authors note that the unexplained pauses could be direct targeting of vaccine-related data collection by the administration—or they could be an indirect consequence of the tumult Kennedy and the Trump administration have inflicted on the CDC, including brutal budget and staff cuts. But Marrazzo argues that the exact mechanism doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Either causative pathway demonstrates a profound disregard for human life, scientific progress, and the dedication of the public health workforce that has provided a bulwark against the advance of emerging, and reemerging, infectious diseases,” she writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marrazzo emphasizes that the lack of current data not only hampers outbreak response efforts but also helps the health secretary realize his vision for the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, “who has stated baldly that the CDC failed to protect Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic, is now enacting a self-fulfilling prophecy. The CDC as it currently exists is no longer the stalwart, reliable source of public health data that for decades has set the global bar for rigorous public health practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, sent Ars Technica a statement saying: “Changes to individual dashboards or update schedules reflect routine data quality and system management decisions, not political direction. Under this administration, public health data reporting is driven by scientific integrity, transparency, and accuracy.”&lt;/p&gt;

The findings challenge the traditional view that episodic (personal) and semantic (fact-based) memories are processed by distinct systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-pale-ocean-gradient-background has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt; University of Nottingham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list has-very-light-gray-to-cyan-bluish-gray-gradient-background has-background"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Discovery:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers found considerable overlap in brain regions involved in both semantic and episodic retrieval, contradicting the idea that they are distinct neural entities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology:&lt;/strong&gt; The study used fMRI scans on 40 participants who recalled pairings between logos and brand names—some based on real-world knowledge (semantic) and others learned during the study (episodic).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding that the “whole brain” is involved in different memory types could lead to new intervention strategies for Alzheimer’s and dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration:&lt;/strong&gt; The research was a joint effort between the University of Nottingham and the University of Cambridge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study into how different parts of memory work in the brain has shown that the same brain areas are involved in retrieving different types of information, the findings could redefine how memory is understood and studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the School of Psychology at the University of Nottingham and the Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at the University of Cambridge have examined episodic and semantic memory, combining task based and fMRI data and have shown that there is no difference in neural activity between successful semantic and episodic retrieval. The findings have been published today in Nature Human Behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Episodic memory refers to the ability to remember a past event that occurred in a particular spatial and temporal context. This type of memory supports the human capacity to re-experience events from our past, as a form of “mental time travel”. Semantic memory, on the other hand, refers to the ability to remember facts and general knowledge about the world that are retrieved independently from their original spatial or temporal context. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this research the team examined how information associated with successful episodic and semantic memory is processed and stored, using tasks that are more closely matched. 40 participants recalled pairings between logos and brand names, where the pairings corresponded to real-world knowledge (semantic task), or were learned in an initial study phase (episodic task).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scanning was used whilst participants were asked to recall details about the associated brand from their prior knowledge in the semantic task, or details about the pairing in the study phase in the episodic task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;fMRI is a non-invasive brain imaging technique that maps brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow, showing which areas are active during tasks like speaking, moving, or thinking. It works by sensing increased oxygen-rich blood flow to active neurons, creating dynamic 3D maps that help doctors and researchers understand brain function, plan surgeries, and study neurological conditions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Roni Tibon, Assistant Professor in the School of Psychology led the study, she said: “We were very surprised by the results of this study as a long-standing research tradition suggested there would be differences in brain activity with episodic and semantic retrieval. But when we used neuroimaging to investigate this alongside the task based study we found that the distinction didn’t exist and that there is considerable overlap in the brain regions involved in semantic and episodic retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings could help to better understand diseases like, dementia and Alzheimer’s as we can begin to see that the whole brain is involved in the different types of memory so interventions could be developed to support this view.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because, for many years, episodic and semantic memories were considered to be distinct entities, a research tradition had developed in which they are explored separately. The consequence of this is a lack of within-study designs that tap into both systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Tibon continues: “Based on what we already knew from previous research in this area we really expected to see stark differences in brain activity but any difference we did see was very subtle, I think these results should change the direction of travel for this area of research and hopefully open up new interest in looking at both sides of memory and how they work together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Editorial Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list has-pale-ocean-gradient-background has-background"&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article was edited by a Neuroscience News editor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journal paper reviewed in full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional context added by our staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Memory Research&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list has-pale-ocean-gradient-background has-background"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt; Emma Thorne&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt; University of Nottingham&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact:&lt;/strong&gt; Emma Thorne – University of Nottingham&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image:&lt;/strong&gt; The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="has-pale-ocean-gradient-background has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Closed access. “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-025-02390-4" type="link" id="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-025-02390-4"&gt;Neural activations and representations during episodic versus semantic memory retrieval&lt;/a&gt;” by Roni Tibon et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tibon, R., Greve, A., Humphreys, G. &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; Neural activations and representations during episodic versus semantic memory retrieval. &lt;em&gt;Nat Hum Behav&lt;/em&gt; (2026). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-025-02390-4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the distinction between episodic and semantic memory is supported by numerous neuropsychological studies, neuroimaging data have shown considerable overlap between regions that are activated during semantic and episodic remembering. This might indicate similar or shared mechanisms but might also result from inadequate task designs or poor functional magnetic resonance imaging signal coverage. Here we compared neural activations and representations associated with successful retrieval of episodic and semantic memories, using tasks that are more closely matched. A total of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 40 participants recalled pairings between logos and brand names, where the pairings corresponded to real-world knowledge (semantic task) or were learned in an initial study phase (episodic task). Neither a priori-defined networks nor clusters generally activated by our task provided evidence for any difference between successful semantic and episodic retrieval, with the Bayes factor for the a priori networks supporting the null hypothesis of no difference.

As birds concentrate, so does the avian influenza virus, increasing the risk of environmental contamination and spillover into domestic poultry, wild predatory species, and even our beloved outdoor domestic cats."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WSDA advises pet owners to take precautions to reduce the risk of exposure, such as keeping pets indoors or in covered areas and avoiding contact with wild birds. The department also recommends practicing good hygiene and avoiding feeding pets raw milk or uncooked meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/washington-state-department-of-agriculture-wsda-indoor-cats-contaminated-raw-food-wild-coast-veterinary-treatment-animal-disease-diagnostic-laboratory" target="_blank"&gt;WSDA warns pet owners after avian flu found in cats linked to contaminated raw food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avian influenza is primarily found in birds but can infect other animals, including cats, foxes, skunks, and raccoons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms in pets include decreased energy, respiratory issues, and neurological signs. Pet owners are urged to contact a veterinarian if they notice signs of illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the avian influenza outbreak began in 2022, 149 domestic cats in the United States have tested positive for bird flu, with four cases in Washington linked to raw pet food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>komonews.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 22:45:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgJBVV95cUxOU3lvZ0I2Z3c1NmQyamJFSXNXaFJ6RXZkM2VzU0dLYU93OGgwSWp0MjNoTkwzdmtieTlJUmxfNlY0YTFtTlhpVS1jTTFCcW1RYTNIeXBOblV6ckE3VTVkX1g1NFRjZU1CQWRIdGNWcXVYbWhMcVM5YUtWVzFldzB1XzRKUUhpQ1V0cVZHY09SMmhMOFl4RW9Pb1RhWUc2WWVFa2xPblVHLUtFbUdVMDh3emNfbkdiamVCaUZWSXBzbEUxUlZWcnlycVJ0WG1hSkJ0UzJlMWRvMENVME5hY3ZZSlpveml4TXdwelBMazR0ZFQ0QU1aTkxUT0phNGhmSThFbW5aUGZoNThZQzk2OU5qUkpUT1BUUk1udzJTSG8wNktyQXV6TXl6Z2MxQ1c0UQ</guid></item><item><title>肠道炎症与阿尔茨海默病的关联再次得到证实- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/gut-inflammation-link-to-alzheimers-disease-confirmed-once-again</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

What's more, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2022.972982/full"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt; have found increased gut inflammation in patients with Alzheimer's compared to controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heston and colleagues suspect microbiome changes trigger gut changes that lead to system-wide inflammation. This inflammation is mild but chronic, causing subtle, incremental damage that eventually interferes with the sensitivity of our body's barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Increased gut permeability could result in higher blood levels of inflammatory molecules and toxins derived from gut lumen, leading to systemic inflammation, which in turn may impair the blood-brain barrier and may promote neuroinflammation, and potentially neural injury and neurodegeneration," &lt;a href="https://www.adrc.wisc.edu/news/gut-inflammation-associated-aging-and-alzheimers-disease"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; University of Wisconsin bacteriologist Federico Rey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now testing mice to see if diet changes associated with increased inflammation can trigger the rodent version of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of research there's still no effective treatment for the millions of people with Alzheimer's worldwide. But with a greater understanding of the biological processes, scientists are getting closer, piece by piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research has been published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-45929-z"&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in January 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Over the next few weeks, Garza, who was 45 at the time, became bloated and was in so much abdominal pain that he was limited to a 'practically all liquid diet.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, and contrary to what you might expect for cancer patients, he actually packed on weight, going from about 150lbs to 170lbs in a matter of months, despite exercising regularly and hardly eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly one year later, Garza underwent surgery for a hernia. At a follow-up appointment after the surgery, doctors felt a mass in his anal sphincter, a group of muscles that help release stool from the rectum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Daniel Garza (pictured) was diagnosed with anal cancer in 2015. Doctors believe HIV had increased his risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On May 5, 2015, a colonoscopy and biopsy revealed stage two anal squamous cell carcinoma, which makes up nine in 10 anal cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For early stages such as this, where the anal cancer has not spread, the five-year survival rate is 85 percent, according to the American Cancer Society. If it spreads, however, that rate drops to 36 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite spending 15 years advocating for HIV awareness and risk factors, Garza was blindsided, never envisioning the disease could cause cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies show HIV can raise the risk of several forms of cancer, including anal cancer, because of its effects on the immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HIV has also been shown to increase the risk of contracting human papillomavirus (HPV), another sexually transmitted infection that causes more than nine in 10 cases of anal cancer. Garza believes he acquired HPV at some point in the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research also estimates that men who have sex with men, such as Garza, are up to 20 times more likely to be diagnosed with anal cancer, as HPV can be transmitted to the anus through anal sex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'After all these years of doing education and prevention and advocacy, I had never heard of the cancers that were associated with HIV,' Garza, now 55, told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I didn't know that. I've never heard it talked about. It was never brought up. As gay and Latino men, we don't talk about any cancers below the belt, and it just never came up.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each year, anal cancer affects about 11,000 Americans, roughly 70 percent of whom are women due to a higher likelihood of contracting HPV. Anal cancer kills just under 2,200 people, with an even split between men and women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The overall risk of being diagnosed with the disease is about one in 500, according to the American Cancer Society, and it accounts for just 0.5 percent of all new cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimates 30 percent of anal cancer patients are between 55 and 64 years old, and the average age at diagnosis is 64. However, HIV is most often diagnosed in people between the ages of 25 and 34, which could be contributing to anal cancer in people under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Garza during his cancer treatments. He is now cancer-free, but the disease caused him to lose half of his anal sphincter &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph from the American Cancer Society shows the gradual increase in anal cancer cases from 1975 through 2023, the latest data available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anal cancer in the US saw an average yearly increase of three percent from 2001 to 2015. Federal data suggests there was a 46 percent surge between 2005 and 2018, largely among older people who did not get the opportunity to be vaccinated for HPV when they were younger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The HPV vaccine was first introduced in 2006 and was only recommended for girls and women between the ages of nine and 26. It was approved for boys in 2009. The recommended age range meant that much of the still-vulnerable, older population missed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HPV can also lay dormant for decades, which may be fueling an increase of anal cancer in people in their 50s and 60s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After his diagnosis, Garza immediately went into advocate mode and began documenting parts of his cancer journey. He made a series of YouTube videos for the first 30 days after his diagnosis, which went up until he shaved his head before receiving chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That side of me was like, "Yes, let's do this. Let's talk about this,"' he told the Daily Mail. 'If I didn't know how to start the conversation, there was going to be millions of people out there that don't know how to either, we need to learn together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But the other part of me, as a Latino gay man, did feel some shame.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Fawcett died of anal cancer at age 62, it sparked an overwhelming amount of speculation from fans and tabloids about her sex life. Anal cancer was long seen as taboo and inherently tied to sexuality and sex habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Garza (right) with his partner, Christian (left). Garza told the Daily Mail that he struggled with feelings of shame after being diagnosed with anal cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph from a 2022 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology shows an increase in anal cancer in men and women above the age of 50 in 2014 - 2018 compared to 2001 - 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Garza also told the Daily Mail that he worried damage to his anus from cancer and treatments could impact intimacy with his longtime partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's a lot of trauma,' he said. 'It's part of our identity, so I developed some shame and some stigma. There was a time where I was like, "Is this my fault? Is this the punishment for my sexuality?"'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Garza started treatment in late May 2015, which included 38 rounds of radiation, weekly chemotherapy and 40 rounds of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HBOT involves lying flat in a chamber with up to three times more air pressure than normal. The goal is to breathe pure oxygen, allowing the blood to carry more of it than usual to damaged tissues and accelerate healing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While lifesaving, the radiation used to destroy his cancer caused Garza to lose half of his anal sphincter. This may later lead to pain and issues controlling bowel movements. To combat this, Garza was fitted in April 2016 with an ostomy bag, which diverts waste from the digestive tract through an opening in the abdomen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Garza stayed on maintenance treatments until 2017, when he was declared cancer free. Doctors believe his chance of the cancer returning is slim, but he undergoes regular blood tests to check for elevated tumor markers like carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and to keep an eye on his HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Garza said anal cancer has, however, changed his relationship with his partner, who was also his main caregiver during treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Garza has now shifted his advocacy work to focus on both HIV and anal cancer. He is the director of outreach at Cheeky Charity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When a partner becomes a caregiver, there is this new connection between the patient and the caregiver, because you have to put aside the relationship part,' Garza told the Daily Mail. 'It changed the way we saw each other mentally because we both went through this journey together.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Damage to Garza's body has also made intimacy a challenge for the couple, though he said they have adapted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Garza has also shifted his advocacy work to focus not just on HIV but on anal cancer and other forms of the disease that are more prevalent among the HIV-positive community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I participate in HIV conferences, I go to cancer conferences,' he said. 'I've done some research and study conferences. I've added information about HPV, mental health, body dysmorphia, sexuality - my story has grown.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also encouraged others experiencing symptoms like anal bleeding, abdominal pain and bloating to seek a second opinion if they feel dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Don't ignore the signs,' he told the Daily Mail. 'If you know something's going on and you've done all the recommendations and it's still happening, get a second opinion. It's okay to offend your doctor a bit, as long as it's about your body.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
