You're seriously gonna endanger yourself and everyone else on the road because someone cut you off? Nobody in the history of mankind has ever 'won' a road rage contest.

Any yard work. I work at an eye doctor's office, and starting in spring, we get at least one patient a week coming in because they got something in their eye while doing yard work. Usually involving mowing, cutting, etc., One lady literally bent over and got a branch to the eye. My BOSS (the doctor) actually got injured this way once too, which he kicked himself over for weeks, lol.

I work in the medical field, and it's shocking how many people follow the medical advice of almost everyone else over their physicians if they even choose to see one. Our office has TVs in the waiting room playing medical tidbits and commercials. The number of patients having full-on verbal meltdowns over the 'fear-mongering' vaccine commercials is immense. Having an advertisement relay how easy it is to get the meningitis vaccine and prevent horrific symptoms while interacting with a man in his twenties having to be physically supported by his mother and his walker due to meningitis was terrible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/haleyfletcher" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anne Bug;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Anne Bug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Hairdresser here.

I'm an EMT and will never forget coming to work and seeing a friend of mine typing up his report after a co-sleeping fatality call. During the call, he and his partner attempted to resuscitate a baby who was suffocated from co-sleeping. The mom had rolled over onto the baby by accident, not realizing she had done so until she woke up and saw the baby had turned blue. She called 911, but there was nothing my coworkers could do. The baby had been without oxygen for too long."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; DaniloAndjus / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Not only will that mom have to live with the guilt for the rest of her life, but my coworkers on that call will never be able to forget trying to revive a dead infant. Co-sleeping might be temporarily easier to get your baby to settle and fall asleep, but it’s NOT worth the risk. Every parent I’ve tried to warn about it says, 'I do it safely. I’d never fall asleep on my baby.' Newsflash–no parent who suffocates their baby by falling asleep on them PLANS to do that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/saraldrich" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ladybug;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;ladybug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahloewentheil/mundane-behaviors-impact-health?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:Medical Professionals Are Sharing "Mundane" Things That Actually Make So Many People Sick;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;Medical Professionals Are Sharing "Mundane" Things That Actually Make So Many People Sick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;6.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Driving tired.

In the last decade, they have become ubiquitous (at least in Europe), but since they're small and not that expensive to buy/rent, many people don't think twice about using them. However, they are pretty fast for something with zero protection for the driver. A single bump on the road can result in concussions, teeth loss, or worse.

There's a space in the bone of your jaw/skull that is being eaten away and filled with pus as the infection is left untreated. Especially on an upper tooth, that infection can easily spread into neighboring tooth structures, possibly requiring IV antibiotics, and can even be fatal. There's a fascial space in the head and neck area called 'the danger zone' because of how easily an infection can spread if it violates that space."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Andreswd / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Ignoring dental cleanings is dangerous.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                        &lt;p&gt;A big part of the reason they’ve managed to spread so quickly, Price said, is that they’re parthenogenetic, which means females are capable of reproducing asexually without the aid of male ticks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So the implications of this mean that a single individual female that lays around 2,000 to 2,500 eggs, all without mating, can create an entire population just by that individual,” Price said. “There’s no other tick in North America that reproduces in this manner. And it’s this unique reproductive strategy that enables the Longhorn tick to very successfully and very rapidly invade new geographic regions across the state and the country.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that migratory hosts, including white-tailed deer and black-capped night herons, are capable of carrying the ticks across vast distances, which also accounts for their rapid geographical spread.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential threats to public health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest questions researchers are asking about longhorned ticks is how much of a threat they pose to humans.
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Past research out of Asia has found that longhorn ticks can carry a large variety of pathogens that affect human health.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it’s not 100% clear if it actually vectors those pathogens,” Phillips said. “So even if it has the bacteria or the virus inside of it, is it going to give it to you if it bites you? That’s not 100% clear. So that’s part of what we were trying to figure out in our research.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate that question, Phillips, along with Temple University ecologist Jocelyn Behm and undergraduate student Jackson Fahey, collected longhorned ticks from forested areas around the Philadelphia area, and tested them for pathogens. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39932861/"&gt;The results&lt;/a&gt; were good.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“None of the ones that we collected carried any pathogens,” Phillips said. “So if you get bit by one around Philadelphia, you hopefully aren’t going to get a disease right away.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those findings match with other, previous rounds of testing that likewise found that longhorned ticks aren’t yet carrying some of the pathogens most dangerous to humans.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s not the end of the story. Price said that some of his lab’s current research has discovered multiple pathogens of human health concern in longhorned ticks collected from Pennsylvania parks and public use areas. Among the pathogens they found is the bacteria responsible for causing Lyme disease, though Price added that studies from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have shown that longhorned ticks are less likely to spread Lyme disease because the bacterium tends to be lost during their molting stage.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Price said, the tick is so new that the role it plays in terms of disease transition remains largely uncertain.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, past studies have found that longhorned ticks are capable of spreading several pathogens that can be found in Pennsylvania, including&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/about/index.html"&gt; Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/about/index.html"&gt; Powassan virus&lt;/a&gt;, a rare but serious disease that can cause encephalitis and meningitis.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Typically with Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterial agent responsible for Lyme disease, the tick has to be attached for 36 hours before that bacteria can be transferred through the bite to an individual,” Price said. “But with Powassan virus, it’s only about 15 minutes, and that’s just because the virus is maintained in the mouth parts and the salivary glands compared to the Lyme disease bacteria that’s maintained in the midgut of the tick.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price added that Phillips’ study helped demonstrate that there is significant overlap in habitat between longhorned ticks and local ticks, which provides a potential pathway for pathogens to be transmitted between the species.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also of concern is the fact that longhorned ticks are more aggressive in their pursuit of hosts and more likely to swarm than other ticks, as well as findings indicating that they’re more likely to be found in areas where local ticks typically don’t reside, like manicured lawns. They’ve also been found to affect domestic animals, like dogs, and can pose significant threats to livestock like cattle.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, longhorned ticks can be protected against using the same methods recommended for local ticks, including keeping your skin covered, and the use of repellents approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, like permethrin.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the wide variety of fruit in our diet, one question persists: which is truly the most beneficial to our health? A study by William Paterson University in the United States provides a clear and surprising answer. According to their analysis, it is neither the apple nor the banana that comes out on top.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-1"&gt;A bomb of micronutrients in a small acidic fruit&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared different varieties of fruit, taking into account the relationship between nutritional value and calorie intake. Lemons stood out for their concentration of vitamins (particularly vitamin C), fibre and powerful antioxidants such as flavonoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-in-text" id="think-1533399861"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A small amount of lemon is enough to provide a significant dose of beneficial compounds, making it a real concentrate of benefits. Its recognised effects include boosting the immune system, helping to absorb iron, improving digestion and even preventing cardiovascular disease, thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/05/18/better-than-nordic-walking-this-old-peoples-sport-melts-fat-with-minimal-effort-even-after-60/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Better than Nordic walking: this “old people’s sport” melts fat with minimal effort (even after 60).&lt;/span&gt;

                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-2"&gt;An acidic food… that alkalinises the body&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interesting fact: although very acidic to the taste, lemons have an alkalinising effect once metabolised, helping to balance the body’s pH level. This action is beneficial for overall metabolism and also promotes better intestinal health, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2014/13_0390.htm"&gt;according to this study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-adsense-2" id="think-4024188054"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers stress a point that is often overlooked: the acidity of lemons is not a disadvantage, but an advantage. It is directly linked to its vitamin C content, a key nutrient for immunity. “Its acidity is an ally of health, not an enemy”, they stress.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-3"&gt;How can you incorporate lemon into your daily routine?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the acidic taste of lemon puts some people off, there are simple ways of incorporating it into your diet: a drizzle of juice in a salad, soup or glass of water, for example. The famous morning lemon water, often popularised on social networks, has also been scientifically validated.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, experts warn: avoid drinking pure lemon juice on an empty stomach too often, as its acidity can damage tooth enamel or irritate sensitive stomachs. It is preferable to dilute it in water, and to consult a health professional if you experience digestive problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/05/02/nearly-60-years-ago-this-psychologist-discovered-the-7-38-55-rule-to-improve-emotional-intelligence/"&gt;

                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-4"&gt;And what about lime?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Limes, also common in France, have many benefits. It is rich in vitamin C and antioxidants, but has a slightly lower concentration of flavonoids (such as eriocitrin and hesperidin) than Sicilian lemons.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thicker lemon peel contains more essential oils (such as limonene), which have antioxidant, antimicrobial and even anticancer properties. Using a little zest in your dishes can further enhance its positive effects. All in all, lemons more than deserve their place in a balanced diet. Rich, low in calories and versatile.

In addition, she says, as you age or gain weight, you’re more vulnerable to a hiatal hernia, where the upper part of the stomach protrudes up through the diaphragm and into the chest cavity. Both stimulate acid reflux and heartburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CUGQEWLCVVHSTOCAY5GDVJ6UZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Many cases of heartburn can be eased with simple lifestyle strategies and short-term use of over-the-counter medications as needed,” says Michael S. Smith, a gastroenterologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X6TT5CNMXVEF3O3TWZESQ2CLQA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But chronic heartburn — more than twice a week — can require more serious steps. That’s because it may signal a condition called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), says Kyle Staller, a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. In addition to heartburn, GERD can cause chest pain, a dry cough, shortness of breath or difficulty swallowing, and it can damage your esophagus or even raise your risk of esophageal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="V7CUG5ISONDLFPF2GFXN2LCE54" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="V7CUG5ISONDLFPF2GFXN2LCE54" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Lifestyle changes&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B6NMN33UHZE7RA6O3D3BT6IM2Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/heartburn/lifestyle-changes-that-deliver-heartburn-relief-a8981533378/" target="_blank"&gt;Lifestyle measures&lt;/a&gt; can be quite effective at keeping heartburn at bay in the first place. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2774728" target="_blank"&gt;2021 Harvard study published in JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found that women who maintained a healthy body weight; didn’t smoke; got 30 minutes of exercise daily; limited coffee, tea and soda to no more than two cups a day; and ate a “prudent diet” — rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fatty fish — were almost 40 percent less likely to develop new heartburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KNP7UAXPMJDW3OSFPKBUGD3BGE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s wise to avoid lying down for two to three hours after you eat to prevent stomach acid from rising in your esophagus and causing heartburn. “I recommend patients elevate the head of their bed, which takes advantage of gravity to keep acid in your stomach,” says Jacob Kurlander, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. (Do this by placing a foam wedge at the head of your bed. Adding more pillows will elevate only your head and neck, which often isn’t effective.) And try sleeping on your left side, which keeps stomach fluid away from your esophagus, Qin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="THDHXXKBXZEMNORMKIRIISYE3E" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="THDHXXKBXZEMNORMKIRIISYE3E" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;For occasional heartburn&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F6DDJ3LFWRBQVJPIXTK72GT6UY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you have heartburn once or twice a week, it’s generally fine to handle it on your own, Staller says. Start by looking at when it seems to occur. For some people, consuming things like caffeine, fatty food, chocolate, alcohol or peppermint may trigger it. “If you notice heartburn after you eat certain foods, try to avoid them,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HTPBMOI2A5BSLN4UTNFN3ZTRMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To cool the burning sensation, you can try an over-the-counter antacid, such as calcium carbonate (Tums and generics) or aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide (Maalox and generics). “They work quickly to neutralize the acid in your stomach and esophagus,” Smith says. But the effects usually last only 30 to 60 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NZU24XMZZJBR7ORTGXTLT5USU4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you have heartburn primarily after eating and it tends to last longer than an hour, Smith recommends OTC drugs known as alginates. (Two popular ones are Gaviscon and Reflux Gourmet.) He says they’re like a buffer between your esophageal wall and stomach acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AHURMXSBYZHHNLLTBQAR545XKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For even longer-term relief, you might consider the occasional use of an OTC H2 blocker such as cimetidine (Tagamet and generic) or famotidine (Pepcid, Zantac and generic). They reduce the production of stomach acid, and their effect can last several hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="WVBXAOD5CFHS5PJIEMNFTOIW4U" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="WVBXAOD5CFHS5PJIEMNFTOIW4U" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;When to see a doctor&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T3BRLQU665HFZOIVXVZIBT5EZY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’re over age 60 and have never had heartburn but suddenly do, see a doctor, even if your discomfort is only occasional. Your doctor may want to rule out inflammation, precancerous changes or esophageal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="24MNZUPXTFH27IGFX3VN4ZYKZQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Do you have heartburn more than twice per week? It’s also wise to check in with your health-care provider, who may suggest a trial of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). These are OTC or prescription-strength drugs such as lansoprazole (Prevacid and generic), esomeprazole (Nexium and generic) or omeprazole magnesium (Prilosec and generic) that block a pump in the stomach that produces stomach acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z5FUNPUEY5AB5JPPPQCIU47UUM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Avoid lying down for two to three hours after you eat to prevent stomach acid from rising in your esophagus and causing heartburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OGAMQEEP4VH2FCXABEXQVZGQWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some research suggests a connection between long-term use of these drugs and bone fractures, serious infections and chronic kidney disease, although they’re not common side effects. Still, using them for a couple of weeks is usually safe, says Fouad Moawad, a gastroenterologist at the Scripps Clinic in San Diego and a spokesperson for the American Gastroenterological Association. And most of the research done so far on potential harm has been observational, which doesn’t prove cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="YP4FIFCF3VFNVDWB5BAL2BT4LU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="YP4FIFCF3VFNVDWB5BAL2BT4LU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Who needs meds long term?&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HJRNAMLZWJCRNJ336LQZLWX6D4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you try a two-week course of PPIs and your symptoms don’t improve or they go away and then return, your doctor may want to do an endoscopy, Moawad says. In this procedure, a small, flexible tube with a camera on it is passed through your mouth into your esophagus to examine it closely for reflux-related damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EH7UYMKGWBCNZIFL2M2UUHAKD4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If you have severe reflux,” Staller says, “you may actually see an ulceration of your esophageal lining.” Your doctor may also want to take a tissue sample (a biopsy) to check for a condition called Barrett’s esophagus or even for esophageal cancer. Barrett’s esophagus, marked by damage to cells that line the esophagus, raises your risk for esophageal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SW3QUGJEANAXDCREGCIBDG7OVY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If we see damage to your esophagus, you will need long-term therapy to reduce your risk for more damage or even cancer,” Moawad says. In these cases, the benefits of an extended use of a PPI — indefinitely, if you have Barrett’s esophagus — outweigh the risks, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MD47MLDTENECVG4DZU5KTYE26Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If testing reveals you have no esophageal damage from GERD but you continue to have frequent, severe heartburn, talk with your doctor about the pros and cons of using a PPI long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CY4T42QSFFBPBOGJEEU2AOKXD4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Your doctor may also suggest that you switch to the newer prescription acid blocker vonoprazan (Voquezna) for a number of weeks or even months. It’s effective at reducing stomach acid and relieving GERD-related heartburn symptoms, but Moawad says it may carry the same potential health risks as PPIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SDRMU3DZRNEATOOIXZ6F5CFN6E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Whether you’re taking a PPI or Voquezna, your doctor should regularly check to determine whether you still need the drug or can be weaned off it. The American Gastroenterological Association advises that people take the lowest effective dosage for the shortest time possible. These meds are often used for longer than necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="CMMJXURLRNEF3ECG57FCTKFPAE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="CMMJXURLRNEF3ECG57FCTKFPAE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;If you’re having trouble swallowing&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V3RNAMWW7BFFRIOVNQYGH4A6YY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Can you have reflux without the heartburn? It’s possible. Some older adults may have atypical or “silent” reflux, or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Symptoms can include a chronic sore throat or cough, hoarseness, trouble swallowing, or “even the sense you’ve got something stuck in your throat,” says Kurlander. If you have any of these, testing to measure the amount of acid passing from your stomach into your esophagus can help determine whether reflux is the cause. Lifestyle steps like &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/dieting-weight-loss/how-to-lose-weight-safely-a7419492212/" target="_blank"&gt;maintaining a healthy weight&lt;/a&gt; may help. If they don’t, your doctor may suggest a short course of meds to reduce acid production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" class="wpds-c-esEUdQ wpds-c-esEUdQ-hqvHjm-isBold-false wpds-c-esEUdQ-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Copyright 2024, Consumer Reports Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NGIOUE72HRGJHDJS2MZ36HBWDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Consumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer and healthier world.

Doctors told her she likely wouldn't live through autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rather than spend the last remaining months of her life suffering, the grandmother-of-two decided to end her life &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-13253305/If-permit-assisted-dying-doctors-people-fear-vulnerable.html"&gt;using Medical Aid In Dying&lt;/a&gt;, also known as MAID, nine months after her diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Goodfriend said: 'What am I going to give this up for? To be in a wheelchair? To have a feeding tube? I wish I had more time to live, but I don't want more time as a patient.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Barbara Goodfriend died of MAID in November 2024 after being diagnosed with ALS earlier that year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I hope that something will get done, something will be accomplished, so that others can have the privilege that I'm having,' she told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medical-aid-dying-new-jersey-maid/"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MAID is an end-of-life option provided to terminally ill Americans in California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was legalized in New Jersey in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the CDC is yet to announce how many people died of MAID in 2024 across the states where it is legal, officials reported 1,216 deaths in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since the law took effect in 2019, a total of 287 people have used MAID to die in New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The option for MAID is only given to those who have less than six months to live, have decision-making capacity to request the option, give informed consent and are residents of the state where it is legal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An attending and a consulting physician then determine if the patient is medically eligible for MAID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If found eligible, the patient needs to submit three requests to opt for MAID to their attending physician - two oral requests and one written request for final approval. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The process involves a combination of drugs, including digoxin, diazepam, morphine, amitriptyline and phenobarbital into the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They slow breathing and heartrate down eventually to the point of stopping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the law, patients must self-administer these drugs. They normally do this by mixing the powdered medications in two ounces of juice and drinking them - which is what Goodfriend opted to do.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The New Jersey local had spent most of her life as a devoted mother and working in fashion &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It usually takes between five to 20 minutes for all the medications to stop the heart from beating, however, many people die within the first few minutes, depending on the severity of their illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After she made her decision to opt for MAID in November 2024, she noted that none of her family members, particularly her daughter, Carol Getz Abolafia, tried to stop her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Abolafia later told CBS News that even though the decision to let her mother go was the hardest thing she had done, she ultimately respected Goodfriend's wishes to opt for MAID and die in comfort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I think the hardest part in all of this, for me as her only child, is to support something so difficult and so contrary to what you want to do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The ultimate love that you can give somebody is to respect their wish, to live the way they wanna live, and to die the way they want to die.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the day of her death came closer, Goodfriend spent a week with her family saying goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's been a week of family, friends. We've done a lot of crying, all of us, but we've laughed. We've enjoyed being together,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Robin Plumer, who has attended nearly 200 MAID deaths in New Jersey, assured Goodfriend she would go to sleep after drinking the drugs and it would be a 'peaceful, dignified death.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, here we are today, and what a strange day this is - that somebody gets to pick the day that they're going to die,' Dr Plumer added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Goodfriend noted that none of her family members, particularly her daughter, Carol Getz Abolafia, (left) object to her choice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As the day of her death came closer, Goodfriend spent a week with her family saying goodbyes and asked that her doctor be present in the room&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As her teary-eyed family surrounded her in her bedroom, Goodfriend died on November 15, 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to a Gallup poll, about two-thirds of Americans support MAID as an end-of-life choice.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But groups such as United Spinal Association fight against the legalization of MAID or what they call 'assisted suicide.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Goodfriend said before her death: 'If it's not a good idea for you, don't consider it, but there has to be a way for those who want it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm not afraid of dying...

In 2019 alone, there were nearly 1,300 cases; in 2020, just 13. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If rates stay where they are, the US could &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7403205/There-reasonable-chance-lose-measles-elimination-status.html"&gt;lose its measles elimination status within two decades.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The MMR vaccine, 97 percent effective at preventing measles, dramatically lowers the risk of severe illness. Yet 96 percent of annual cases &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14691635/Americas-measles-outbreak-reaches-terrifying-milestone-96-infected-common.html"&gt;occur in unvaccinated&lt;/a&gt; people, with one in five hospitalized and three in 1,000 dying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Stanford research projects that if vaccinations dip by just five percent, the case count of measles could jump to 5.7 million with 2,550 deaths over the next 25 years. In the worst-case scenario, if vaccination coverage were to plummet by 50 percent, cases could exceed 51 million with between 150,000 and 164,000 deaths&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US&lt;span&gt; is facing its largest measles outbreak in 30 years, centered in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage"&gt;Gaines and Lubbock counties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, West Texas, where just 74 percent and 92 percent of children are vaccinated, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Texas has confirmed 728 measles cases so far, with over 400 in Gaines County alone. Two children in Texas and one in New Mexico have died. New Mexico has reported 71 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Statewide, Texas’ MMR vaccination rate sits at 94 percent, just below the 95 percent needed for herd immunity — but in parts of West Texas, rates are far lower. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Gaines County’s Loop Independent School District, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage"&gt;only 46 percent&lt;/a&gt; of kindergarteners are vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gaines County also leads the state in vaccine opt-outs, with nearly 14 percent of schoolchildren skipping at least one required shot last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The outbreak &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7377063/Texas-cities-measles-outbreak-1-000-cases-study-finds.html" class=""&gt;centering on Gaines County&lt;/a&gt; has since spread to dozens of other states, offering researchers a grim preview of what could happen nationwide if vaccination rates drop to West Texas levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Stanford team, whose data was published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833361"&gt;JAMA Network&lt;/a&gt;, used a computer model for their projections — incorporating randomness to reflect real-world uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They drew on US Census, CDC surveillance, and National Immunization Survey data from 2004 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Falling vaccination rates accelerate measles’ return. Just a five percent drop halves the time until endemic spread, while 10 percent+ declines push the US toward outbreaks within years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The model compared outcomes under current vaccination rates - 87 to 95 percent - and scenarios with rates increased or decreased by five, 10, 25, and 100 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even small declines in coverage could spark major outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles was declared eliminated in the US four decades after a vaccine became available — a feat estimated to have saved 94 million lives — but experts fear that progress is slipping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told DailyMail.com: 'We are now in danger of losing the elimination designation, and we were well ahead of the world before.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 1,020 measles cases have been confirmed in 31 states this year, with 92 percent linked to 14 outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Schaffner added: ‘Given that the current outbreak continues and its now spawned “daughter” outbreaks among other Mennonite communities and there are yet other small outbreaks, we could potentially lose that elimination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Here we are stepping back to yesteryear.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gradually rising case count coincides with a rise in vaccine exemptions for religious reasons in schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Measles typically causes high fever, cough, and a splotchy rash, but serious complications like encephalitis (brain swelling) occur in about 1 in 1,000 children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2014, the exemption rate was about 1.7 percent, before a 2015 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7605285/DISNEYLAND-visitors-exposed-measles-officials-warn.html" class=""&gt;measles outbreak at Disneyland&lt;/a&gt; drew national attention to falling vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By 2016, exemptions rose to two percent, despite moves by states like California to eliminate personal belief exemptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trend continued, reaching 2.5 percent in 2019 — the year the U.S. saw its highest measles case count since 1992, largely in under-vaccinated communities.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pandemic further disrupted vaccination efforts, pushing exemptions to 2.8 percent in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By 2023, rates climbed to 3.5 percent, with MMR coverage in kindergarteners dipping below the 95 percent threshold needed for herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vaccine skeptics meanwhile have risen to positions of power, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has promoted discredited claims linking the MMR vaccine to autism and founded the leading anti-vaccine group, Children’s Health Defense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CDC and JAMA data suggest exemptions could soon top 4 percent, particularly in rural areas with limited healthcare access and public health distrust, as well as affluent, well-educated urban enclaves drawn to 'alternative' medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Vaccine exemptions for public school students are on track to top four percent, up from 1.7 percent a decade ago&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Parents who withhold their children from vaccination are not randomly scattered throughout the population, they generally cluster, which means you have a close affiliation in schools, which makes people susceptible. And should the virus be introduced in their group, it will rapidly spread,’ Dr Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most people with measles develop a high fever, cough, and a blotchy red rash. But serious complications aren’t rare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 1 in 1,000 children develop encephalitis — dangerous brain swelling that can cause permanent damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A rare, delayed complication called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) strikes about 2 in every 100,000 measles cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Years after infection, it causes memory problems, personality changes, seizures, and worsening brain function, progressing to a vegetative state and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 19:04:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>向数百万海滩游客发出关于食肉细菌的警告，因为受害者被截肢-每日邮报 | Warning to millions of beachgoers over flesh-eating bacteria as victims suffer amputations - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Richard Empson and Cornell Arceneaux of Baton Rouge, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/louisiana/index.html" id="mol-42de29a0-3a61-11f0-9bce-2b2fdcade45d"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, what began as a routine day near the water became a fight for their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their stories are a chilling warning as the fast-moving killer Vibrio vulnificus, a flesh-eating bacteria, becomes an increasing threat along America's beaches and shores, from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Empson was enjoying a relaxed family vacation in Bay St Louis, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/mississippi/index.html" id="mol-ed5f3830-3a5f-11f0-9ff3-d3b562b57ddf"&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;, in the summer of 2016 when his nightmare began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After wading in warm waters for hours while fishing, the bacteria entered his body through microscopic breaks in his skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What started as a carefree afternoon ended with a frantic rush to intensive care. Doctors gave him a medication with just a 20 percent chance of working. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it failed, they delivered a brutal ultimatum: lose his leg, or lose his life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Arceneaux has survived three separate brushes with Vibrio — twice from handling raw shellfish with open cuts on his hand and arm, and once from eating raw oysters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Richard Empson, 78, had been fishing in Bay St Louis, in Mississippi , on vacation there with his family in the summer of 2016. He waded in the warm water for hours, allowing the flesh-eating bacteria ample time to burrow into his pores&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one instance, pain and swelling set in within two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time he reached the hospital, blisters had formed and emergency surgery was underway to save his limbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He lived, but his arms now bear deep scars stretching to his shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Often contracted through small cuts or scrapes, Vibrio vulnificus hijacks the bloodstream and unleashes a cascade of flesh-destroying toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It starves tissues of blood and oxygen, turning skin black and muscle into sludge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If not caught in time, a minor wound can spiral into a life-threatening emergency — sometimes in less than 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;About 150 to 200 V. vulnificus infections are reported to the CDC each year and about one in five die. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;The CDC has not issued an annual report on Vibrio in the U.S. since 2019, when 2,685 infections were recorded—but trends suggest cases are rising. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;A sweeping review of CDC data from 1988 to 2018 revealed that Vibrio wound infections on the East Coast surged eightfold, from about 10 to over 80 cases per year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;Rising ocean temperatures are making colder regions like Alaska, the Baltic Sea, and Chile more hospitable to Vibrio, with scientists flagging them as potential hotspots. Paired with high seafood demand, coastal recreation, and climate change, experts warn of a sharp rise in infections—and deaths—in the near future. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;At the Bay St. Louis ER, when Empson mentioned the beach, hospital staff called a surgeon and rushed him to ICU. Doctors fought to stop the infection, but warned his odds were just 20 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Empson got back to his family’s beach house, he began experiencing early signs of vibriosis – swelling and pain in his foot, fever, chills, and blisters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He tried to leave town to return to a hospital near his home in Baton Rouge, but he and his family realized they wouldn’t make it. They went to a hospital near their stay in Waveland Beach, Mississippi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We got to the emergency room in Bay St. Louis, and when they found out we’d been at the beach, they were calling for a surgeon, and they immediately moved me into intensive care,’ Empson told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/sports/outdoors/two-louisiana-anglers-live-to-tell-their-stories-about-flesh-eating-bacteria-in-coastal-waters/article_fe94e2d5-7ea4-41a4-994d-73e20d918c35.html"&gt;The Advocate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors then attempted to stop the infection in its tracks, but Empson was told the chance of it working was about 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;JERUSALEM (JNS) – Stand up paddle boarding has been variously described in Jewish and Israeli sources as “a good metaphor for life” and as an activity for which the Jewish state, and particularly its Dead Sea, is a “paradise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong class="whatsapp-promotion-mobile"&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But according to seven Israeli doctors and researchers from the Hillel Yaffe Medical Center and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, who published their findings this month in the &lt;em&gt;Israel Medical Association Journal&lt;/em&gt;, stand up paddling can lead to life-threatening health problems even in people who are in good shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The possible health advantages boasted by SUP include core muscle training and cardiovascular benefits,” the scholars, led by Dr. Maguli Barel, write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“SUP has been promoted as a sport that both promotes fitness and strength and is enjoyable,” but it “may be associated with sudden changes in blood pressure and increase in shear stress that may play an important role in atherothrombosis,” they add, of blood clots that can lead to heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The scholars’ data suggests that stand up paddling “may also trigger life-threatening coronary events, even in fit individuals,” they add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="related-articles-module bg-silver moved"&gt;
&lt;div class="related-articles-inner"&gt;
&lt;div class="related-articles-items"&gt;
&lt;div class="related-articles-item"&gt;
&lt;p class="related-articles-item-text"&gt;The researchers note that the sport, which is “a mix between canoeing and surfing,” involves someone standing “upright on a surfboard” and propelling themselves via a single paddle. “It is an emerging recreational activity that is attracting public attention and gaining popularity because it promotes fitness, strength and improved balance,” they note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The scholars studied five men and one woman—whose ages ranged from 41 to 69 and who were all fit—who experienced sudden cardiac arrest or a heart attack while paddling. “All patients were discharged alive,” they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“A review of the literature showed a paucity of scientific evidence to substantiate the proposed health benefits of SUP surfing,” they wrote. “Our cluster of acute cardiac events occurring during this activity calls for heightened public awareness to better understand the physical demand required to practice SUP.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There is a need for more data regarding the cardiovascular clinical aspects of this water activity and the risks it entails,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They note that their medical center is located near “an active and popular sea sport center with many different attractions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One of the six subjects, a 41-year-old man, was “otherwise healthy” but found collapsed, lying on his surfboard a few yards from shore “with his head in the water,” they write. Bystanders, who performed CPR immediately, managed after half an hour to help his blood circulation resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-540109" src="https://me.jnsi.org/uploads/2025/05/F240523MG022-1320x880.jpg" alt="Stand up paddle board"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A man stand up paddle boards in the Kinneret, in the northern Israeli town of Tiberias, May 23, 2024. Credit: Michael Giladi/Flash90.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“He was evacuated to our center in critical condition and was sedated and intubated,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Another otherwise healthy man, 47, collapsed on a beach a few minutes after stand up paddling, and a third man, 69, complained of chest pain while paddling with his son and collapsed when they returned to shore. “He was pulled from the water by his son,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The other three patients were a 46-year-old woman who developed chest pain while paddling a few hundred yards and made it back to shore, a 67-year-old man who raced a friend some 1,000 yards to shore with “intense paddling and surfing” before experienced chest pain and shortness of breath and a 57-year-old man who had a heart attack after feeling chest pain and shortness of breath while paddling a few hundred yards from the shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Most incidents occur during summer months, which are characterized by elevated temperatures and usually high humidity. These conditions are known to significantly impact heart rate, and exercise intensity potentially exacerbates cardiovascular strain,” the researchers wrote. “Two of our patients had a previous heart condition but were asymptomatic and were able to perform vigorous exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Sudden cardiac arrest in recreational athletes, while rare, can be a significant concern,” they added. “This condition refers to an unexpected death due to cardiac causes within a short time frame, often during or immediately after physical activity.”&lt;/p&gt;

My perfectly healthy four year old not being able to walk scared me. I had no idea [what was wrong with her].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We went camping on Mother's day weekend so [the tick] had been there for a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As soon as she woke up she couldn't walk and she was crawling on the floor. Think of somebody that's been intoxicated by &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-ed98c730-371c-11f0-9a61-af4c39c1af23"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;. That's why we took her to the hospital.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After rushing her to the emergency department, doctors found a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13830053/Man-61-deadly-tick-borne-infection-brain-doctors-report-case.html"&gt;dime-sized tick latched onto Madeline's head&lt;/a&gt;, which was causing tick paralysis, a rare and life-threatening condition caused by a neurotoxin released by certain ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Justice added: 'The paralysis affected her whole body and she was unable to make eye contact with anybody. It caused complete paralysis from the bottom and it was working its way up to her hands and her head and she was not even able to sit up.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Madeline and her family spent the weekend camping to celebrate Mother's Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Taylor Justice had to pull her daughter around the hospital in a wagon because Madeline couldn't walk by herself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tick paralysis is rare and there is no formal monitoring of the condition, so it is unknown how many cases occur per year. It's been documented worldwide and is more commonly seen in children and adult men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been documented in animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The paralysis is caused by a neurotoxin from tick saliva, and the condition has been associated with 40 different species. In North America, most cases are associated with the American dog tick and the Rocky Mountain wood tick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the condition is caught early and the tick is removed, paralysis will reverse and a complete recovery is expected, typically within 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If not diagnosed and left to advance, it can lead to respiratory failure and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include weakness, paralysis beginning in the legs and rising, loss of coordination, difficulty breathing and paralysis of the respiratory muscles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They usually occur two to seven days after a tick bite.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being rushed to the hospital, doctors ran tests and did a CT scan on Madeline that revealed no significant findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors then referred her to a more advanced children's hospital three hours away where a neurologist performed tests on her to check the toddler's reflexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors discovered a female Rocky Mountain wood tick, which has toxic saliva that caused paralysis in Madeline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Madeline's mom said the family is always outside and will be vigilant about checking for ticks from now on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Justice said: 'The next morning [the neurosurgeon] came in and he noticed she couldn't use her hands. We tried to play [a game] and she couldn't pick up the checkers to put them in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He said "something's not right" and all of a sudden, he just asked "are you guys outside a lot?" We live outside and our family goes camping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As soon as he asked, he checked her head. Two seconds later he said he'd found the diagnosis and it was the tick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The neurologist discovered a female Rocky Mountain wood tick on her head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Justice continued: 'I felt sick and I wanted it removed immediately. It was in her blood. Only females produce that neurotoxin in their saliva and whenever they bite their saliva produces a numbing agent so Madeline wouldn't feel it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They were concerned it could cause Lyme disease because it can cause long term effects on children and adults.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lyme disease is another tick-borne illness, but it is not caused by a neurotoxin as with tick paralysis. Lyme is a bacterial infection that causes flu-like symptoms and it is not reversible by simply removing the tick - doctors must prescribe antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Madeline's mom, Justice (left), said she was terrified when her daughter woke up not being able to walk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Madeline was able to walk again four hours after the tick was removed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once her doctors realized the cause of her paralysis, they removed the tick from her head.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Madeline was able to walk again four hours after the tick was removed and she was given a dose of doxycycline - an antibiotic - to reduce the risk of Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following the ordeal, Justice said she will now 'be so vigilant' about carrying tick repellant and checking Madeline for ticks and urges other parents to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I never thought a tick bite would lead to all this. I've never seen anything like it before. She still wakes up in the morning and her legs are a little stiff but once she starts walking throughout the day it's like normal again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Check your kids [for tick bites] and be adamant about checking their heads, behind their ears and even their waistline. There's a possibility that could happen.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

So when my editor asked if I would cut them out completely for a week and write about how it impacted me, I thought it would be pretty anticlimactic.

Technically, any food that has been changed from its natural state is processed—even if that only change was washing, chopping or packaging. Even a frozen bag of mixed vegetables is processed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ultra-processed is a little different. &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-are-ultra-processed-foods-and-are-they-bad-for-our-health-2020010918605" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ultra-processed foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; are industrially manufactured products that often contain additives and other ingredients that aren’t typically found in a home kitchen. With this in mind, I decided that any food with an ingredients list containing anything I didn’t recognize or could easily source was ultra-processed. If I couldn’t make the food at home based on the ingredients list, it was a no-go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 1 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to begin my experiment of nixing ultra-processed foods starting with the foods I already had at home. I wanted the first part of the week to serve as a reality check for how many ultra-processed foods were currently part of my diet and the second part to be after I went grocery shopping, to see how cutting ultra-processed foods out impacted what I bought. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I typically start the day with the same breakfast: a bowl of fruit, Justin’s Almond Butter and trail mix. The almond butter only had two ingredients, so I was all good there, but looking at the ingredients for the trail mix, I realized it was more processed than I thought. Besides nuts and dried cranberries, it contains mini peanut butter cups, which made for a long ingredients list full of additives. Instead of having it, I switched it out for Purely Elizabeth granola, which didn’t have any additives. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Later in the day, I wanted a snack. I was craving some naan crisps and hummus. Unfortunately, the naan crisps had an ingredients list I just couldn’t replicate in the kitchen, making them a no-go. Instead, I had my hummus with some Simple Mill crackers, which were made only with ingredients I could recognize.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For lunch, I planned to have a salad with leftover salmon and Parmesan cheese. The hurdle here came down to the dressing. All the salad dressings I had were full of additives. This experiment was already turning out to be harder than I thought. Instead of dressing, I topped my salad off with olive oil and some rosemary and basil from my garden.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dinner was chicken, green beans and rice. It was the first meal of the day I didn’t have to alter. I always crave something sweet for dessert and my recent go-to has been Tru Fu chocolate-covered fruit. I thought this would still get a pass, but due to the chocolate, the ingredients list was super long. I’ll admit it. I cheated here and still had a handful of the fruit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/sneaky-ways-youre-adding-calories-to-your-diet-according-to-nutritionists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:5 Sneaky Ways You're Adding More Calories to Your Diet Without Realizing It;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;5 Sneaky Ways You're Adding More Calories to Your Diet Without Realizing It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, I had the same breakfast as before with the Purely Elizabeth granola taking the place of trail mix. But once again, lunch was a hurdle. Not wanting a salad, I was planning on heating up a Fillo tamale. These tamales are labeled as vegan and preservative-free, so I assumed they weren’t ultra-processed. Unfortunately, the ingredients list proves otherwise. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of the tamale, I made a salad using tofu as my protein. I topped it off with olive oil and herbs like I did yesterday. At least my garden herbs were getting good use! I had to admit, it had just as much flavor as when I used a bottled salad dressing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dinner was homemade kimchi fried rice, mixed vegetables and tofu. Nothing ultra-processed here! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/food-people-over-50-should-eat-more-of-according-to-dietitians" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The One Food Nutritionists Are Begging People Over 50 Start Eating ASAP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The One Food Nutritionists Are Begging People Over 50 Start Eating ASAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lunch was easier for me today because I had leftover kimchi fried rice. It was snack time that was today’s hurdle. I was craving something sweet, and I knew my tried-and-true chocolate-covered fruit was out. Instead, I had Simple Mills honey cinnamon crackers, which had a simple ingredients list.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That afternoon, I got &lt;a href="https://parade.com/food/khloe-kardashian-surprising-new-snack-release-khloud-protein-popcorn-target" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Khloe Kardashian’s new protein popcorn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Khloe Kardashian’s new protein popcorn&lt;/a&gt; in the mail sent to me by her publicist. I like the idea of a protein popcorn, but since it was made with whey protein powder (not an ingredient found in the common kitchen), I couldn’t try it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dinner I had planned for tonight was vegan chicken tacos, made with Daring plant-based cajun chicken. This dinner ended up being full of ultra-processed landmines. Not only was the plant-based chicken ultra-processed, so were the organic corn and wheat tortillas and Siete tortilla chips. The only non-ultra-processed ingredients were the pico de gallo and guacamole. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was a big lesson to me that just because something was plant-based or organic didn’t mean it wasn’t ultra-processed, or even healthy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/best-foods-for-memory-brain-health-registered-dietitians" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:8 Foods to Eat Daily for Better Memory, According to RDs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;8 Foods to Eat Daily for Better Memory, According to RDs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This morning, I opened the pantry and realized I was completely out of almond butter for my breakfast. I did find a jar of peanut butter, but the ingredients list was full of additives. Since nut butter was the only protein-containing ingredient in my breakfast, this meant my meal had no protein whatsoever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not surprisingly, I was starving by the time lunch rolled around and decided to walk to the local deli. Eyeing the menu, I tried to figure out which item was the least processed. I opted for a Greek hummus wrap. This still left questions: What was in the wrap? What about the hummus? This showed me that eating out while avoiding ultra-processed foods is super tricky since you don’t have access to the ingredient lists. My wrap also came with a side of potato chips. Not being able to resist, I ate them. I blame the lack of protein at breakfast. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For dinner, my partner and I wanted to order some takeout. We decided sushi was the least processed option. I enjoyed my tuna rolls without worrying about what was in them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 5 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the week, I always treat myself to a slice of banana bread from a local French bakery. Everything is made fresh on-site, so I figured my banana bread didn’t count as ultra-processed; I could make it at home if I wanted to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For lunch, I bought a tossed salad. The only ultra-processed ingredient was the Caesar dressing I asked for; a similar hurdle to when I make my salads at home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For dinner, my partner and I made pasta with chicken sausage we bought from the local butcher’s market. Chicken sausage is certainly processed and not the healthiest, but at least we bought it from a local source. But I had to admit to myself that it likely didn’t make it much healthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 6 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, my partner and I planned our meals for the following week based on avoiding ultra-processed foods. Our dinners tend not to have ultra-processed foods anyway, but it was much easier to eat non-ultra-processed foods when the grocery shopping was based around it—including snack choices. That night, we had roasted chicken and green beans for dinner. It was simple and filling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though my fridge and pantry were stocked with plenty of non-ultra-processed foods, I still found myself reaching for some Siete chips at lunchtime and some chocolate-covered strawberries for dessert. Otherwise, I avoided anything ultra-processed the entire day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What a Week of Trying to Cut Ultra-Processed Foods Taught Me&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest lesson I learned from my week-long experiment of trying to avoid ultra-processed foods is just how much they are ingrained in our modern food system. Even some of my go-to “healthy” staples, like trail mix, plant-based chicken, salad dressings and chocolate-covered fruit were more processed than I realized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it was easier to make substitutions than I realized. It turns out that a salad topped with olive oil and herbs is just as flavorful as one topped with a bottled dressing. And some brands are making a conscious effort to only use simple ingredients, like Simple Mills or my trusty almond butter favorite, Justin’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also learned that avoiding ultra-processed foods is infinitely easier when you base your grocery shopping around it and plan your meals accordingly, including figuring out what you’re going to eat when a craving for something sweet or salty hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, I am absolutely going to be even more mindful of reading ingredient lists when I grocery shop. But I will admit that there are some foods I’m just not going to replace, like my beloved chocolate-covered fruit. Everything in moderation, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/day-of-heart-healthy-eating-according-to-a-cardiologist" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: ‘I’m a Cardiologist, and This Is What a Typical Day of Heart-Healthy Eating Looks Like for Me';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: ‘I’m a Cardiologist, and This Is What a Typical Day of Heart-Healthy Eating Looks Like for Me'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/i-tried-cutting-out-ultra-processed-food-for-a-week" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:‘I Tried Cutting Out Ultra-Processed Food for a Week and I Was Shocked by What I Learned’;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;‘I Tried Cutting Out Ultra-Processed Food for a Week and I Was Shocked by What I Learned’&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on Parade on May 26, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTFA2cm1vTTdrYTFlb0c2elNDWTZ5Z3JFcjBaYXhHSTZDQlVJOHpFU2RIejZjX3U1RWh0Wl9Iakl5Q1lSay1zY25XYmdtc2RyZnZzTWN5enNSVHM3RlRYRF8yMUJ5N05VMG9nLVFhMkY0cmtEZTlvY2NJVw</guid></item><item><title>大麻二酚显示出通过针对大脑多动症治疗小鼠阿尔茨海默病的前景- PsyPost | Cannabidiol shows promise for treating Alzheimer’s in mice by targeting brain hyperactivity - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxOaHV4cXpYWXlJS003SUF2RnJ3eTVtaFNkNEZ0UFk1NjJVOE5fNjV6SV93LUEwd0lXb0M2LUZhNTEwY2lyTDVlckxxdHdmWExhcWR1Mm8xNUZqNXE1eUhPTGdvd28ybWkzVkRsNWZ3MjhYYXh4a2dEaS1zbGd4cGhMZE8tc0dTWlozanh2U3hkYnJBSlpWNGV5UWdsbnNHOWJva2laMXUzei1vTGUzRC0wYU1rbEJhUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-024-02789-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; provides preliminary evidence that cannabidiol, a compound derived from cannabis, may reduce cognitive decline and brain pathology in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Researchers found that chronic administration of cannabidiol improved memory performance and reduced the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques—one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s. These benefits were linked to cannabidiol’s ability to regulate overactive brain cells in a key region involved in memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabidiol, or CBD, is one of the main components of cannabis. Unlike tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), it does not produce a high and is generally considered safe. In recent years, researchers have been exploring its potential therapeutic effects on various neurological and psychiatric conditions, including epilepsy, anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. One area of interest is whether CBD can calm excessive brain activity, a problem observed in people and animals with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, based in China, conducted a series of experiments to test whether CBD could reduce symptoms of Alzheimer’s in genetically modified mice known as 5×FAD mice. These animals are widely used in research because they develop Alzheimer’s-like symptoms, including memory loss and the buildup of toxic amyloid-beta plaques in the brain. The researchers administered a low daily dose of CBD to these mice for just over a month and then assessed their behavior, brain activity, and the extent of brain pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate memory function, the mice completed a series of behavioral tests. In a novel object recognition test, CBD-treated mice spent more time exploring new objects, indicating improved recognition memory. In two separate spatial memory tasks—the Morris water maze and the Barnes maze—CBD-treated mice learned the location of a hidden platform more quickly and remembered it better than untreated mice. These improvements in memory occurred without changes in general motor function or anxiety-like behavior, suggesting that CBD had specific effects on cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond behavior, the researchers looked directly at the brains of the mice. They found that CBD treatment led to a reduction in amyloid-beta plaques, particularly in the dentate gyrus, a part of the hippocampus that plays an important role in learning and memory. The reduction was most noticeable in smaller plaques, which are typically newly formed. This suggests that CBD may help slow the formation of new plaques rather than clear out existing ones. Importantly, the extent of plaque reduction in the dentate gyrus was strongly associated with the improvements in memory, highlighting the relevance of this brain region in both pathology and treatment response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also investigated how CBD might achieve these effects at the molecular level. The researchers focused on glycine receptors, which help regulate electrical activity in the brain by dampening excessive neuronal firing. These receptors are particularly abundant in the dentate gyrus. Previous studies have shown that CBD can enhance the activity of glycine receptors by binding to a specific site on the receptor protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using genetic techniques, the researchers disrupted glycine receptor function in some mice to test whether these receptors were necessary for CBD’s effects. In mice where glycine receptors in the dentate gyrus were either knocked down or altered to prevent CBD binding, the beneficial effects of CBD disappeared. These mice showed no improvements in memory and no reduction in amyloid-beta plaques, strongly suggesting that glycine receptors are a key mechanism behind CBD’s therapeutic action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore how this might affect brain function, the researchers used several techniques to measure neuronal activity. In untreated Alzheimer’s model mice, neurons in the dentate gyrus were overly active, firing more rapidly than normal. Chronic CBD treatment reduced this hyperactivity, bringing the cells’ behavior closer to normal levels. This calming effect was not observed in mice with disabled glycine receptors, further reinforcing their central role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also recorded brain activity in living mice by implanting electrodes and using calcium imaging, a technique that tracks real-time cellular activity. They found that after CBD infusion, many neurons in the dentate gyrus showed a marked drop in activity. In contrast, mice with a mutated version of the glycine receptor that could not interact with CBD showed little to no change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these findings are promising, there are several limitations to the study. First, the research was conducted in mice, not humans. Although animal models are useful for understanding disease mechanisms and testing treatments, they do not capture all aspects of human Alzheimer’s. Second, the study only used male mice, and future research will need to explore whether the same results hold true in females. Third, while the study identified glycine receptors as an important target for CBD, the compound interacts with many other receptors and systems in the brain. More work is needed to understand how these other pathways may contribute to its effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that CBD has potential as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. By reducing abnormal brain activity and slowing the formation of harmful plaques, CBD may help preserve memory and cognitive function. The study also highlights the importance of glycine receptors in regulating brain activity and offers a new avenue for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-024-02789-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cannabidiol ameliorates cognitive decline in 5×FAD mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease through potentiating the function of extrasynaptic glycine receptors&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jin Jin, Chonglei Fu, Jing Xia, Heyi Luo, Xianglian Wang, Si Chen, Huanhuan Mao, Kai Yuan, Lin Lu, Wei Xiong, and Guichang Zou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 18:01:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxOaHV4cXpYWXlJS003SUF2RnJ3eTVtaFNkNEZ0UFk1NjJVOE5fNjV6SV93LUEwd0lXb0M2LUZhNTEwY2lyTDVlckxxdHdmWExhcWR1Mm8xNUZqNXE1eUhPTGdvd28ybWkzVkRsNWZ3MjhYYXh4a2dEaS1zbGd4cGhMZE8tc0dTWlozanh2U3hkYnJBSlpWNGV5UWdsbnNHOWJva2laMXUzei1vTGUzRC0wYU1rbEJhUQ</guid></item><item><title>“它看起来无害，但它很危险” ：人们正在分享我们所有人所做的常见事情，这些事情实际上是超级危险的-雅虎 | "It Seems Harmless, But It's Dangerous": People Are Sharing The Common Things We All Do That Are Actually Super Risky - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxNVlN2UFhSU0YtZnM4YlhLNVB0Vm1qZzJrS2pRMjg4dHd5OWczRzBXb015cHAxUDBVUkJjTGR6QWJOakJxa1hIX1RjXy1DbXFxUmJMYV9VclJpa01aWUoyQ2wxOU5pSzdNNS1QM1FCODdseVRIaDZtdTNEQ1huam5LZjE5bWpZeGtmckU3d3NNQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you're like me, and spend too much time listening to people yap on TikTok, you've probably come across a few "Things I Would Never Do As A..." videos, wherein people, such as doctors, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@travelingnurse/video/7210784199446498603" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nurses;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;nurses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ladyspinedoc/video/7121359501004901675" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neurosurgeons;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;neurosurgeons&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@zemparamedic/video/7151201954079771946" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:paramedics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;paramedics&lt;/a&gt;, share the things they would never do as experts in their fields.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I always find their takes so enlightening and fascinating, so I thought &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alanavalko/harmless-things-that-are-actually-dangerous" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I'd also ask the BuzzFeed Community;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;I'd also ask the BuzzFeed Community&lt;/a&gt; to share with me all the seemingly harmless, but possibly risky things we all do way too often.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;We had everyone from car mechanics to attorneys to everyday people write in.

If you hear a clicking noise when you turn the key in your car's ignition, it could be an indication of a more serious problem with your car battery. Those batteries work off of a chemical reaction and make hydrogen gas, which then vents in fairly large quantities into your hot engine compartment full of hot metal, explosives, flowing electricity, and sparks... hydrogen is SUPER flammable!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The white crust on the outside of an older battery is the corrosive acid eating the metals, so you can bet if that acid is getting out, hydrogen (which is the smallest molecule that we know of) is getting out.

But the realisation that I had cancer was hard to swallow.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The biopsy removed the growth and Ms Buckell recovered well—until three years later in November 2024, when she noticed another spot on the side of her nose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She tried to burst it with her fingers, but the spot would not stop bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I noticed another spot, this time double the size, that wouldn't budge'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kerry-Ann is a single mother, to her son Albie, who was just 10 months old when she was first diagnosed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kerry-Ann now wants to do everything she can to encourage skin safety, warning her clients of the dangers of sun exposure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two weeks later, the spot was still there, and, as a single mother to her 10-month old son Albie, Ms Buckell was becoming increasingly concerned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As much as I tried to stay in denial, I knew what it was', she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hairstylist was referred to a dermatologist who confirmed that the cancer was back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Buckell had the disease removed, which left her with a big black hole on the side of her nose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This time, it was much bigger,' she said. 'It was scrapped off and I was left with a big gaping black hole on my face that made me really self-conscious.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Buckell's nose has since healed and she has recently opened up her own hair salon after taking a course in trichology—the study of diseases and disorders of the hair and scalp—to help her understand warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also checks her client's scalps for any signs of skin cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Never did I think skin cancer would appear as a regular looking spot', she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm now doing everything I can to encourage skin safety.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now urging people to take precautions before heading out into the sun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It might leave you glowing at first, but it could result in your life being on the line.'   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It takes a scarily low number of sunburns – only five – to make you vulnerable to skin cancer, which kills more than 2,000 people in the UK every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The deadliest type is melanoma, which penetrates into the deep layers of the skin and can spread to other organs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Non-melanoma skin cancers, like basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, are slow growing, starting in the top later of skin, meaning that doctors can almost always cure them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms include a spot that won't stop bleeding—due to the fragile nature of the tumours—a bump that appears darker than the surrounding skin, and crusty patches of skin that feel rough or itchy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst this type of skin cancer is relatively harmless, patients often have to undergo invasive operations to remove large chunks of their skin, in order to remove the cancer—which in some cases can be disfiguring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most harmful type of sunrays are UVB rays which hit the outer most layer of the skin and cause sunburn, as well as UVA rays which penetrate much deeper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both of these are ultraviolet, meaning they can cause skin cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A worrying 90 per cent of skin cancer cases in the UK are a direct result of sunburn and using sunbeds, according to Cancer Research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Suffice to say, this is the latest in a long line of putative health benefits for vitamin D supplementation, most of which have failed to live up to the initial hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Time to declare my interest: despite my scepticism, vitamin D is the only supplement I take. To be candid, I have no idea whether a) I need it and b) if it is doing me any good, but I am well aware that low levels of the vitamin are associated&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; with an increased risk of developing health issues ranging from rickets and osteoporosis, to stroke, heart attack, cancer and diabetes. Plus most of us in the UK should be taking supplements, according to longstanding guidance. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Although best known for its action on bones, vitamin D receptors are found on cells throughout the body, including the immune system, so adequate levels are thought to be vital for much more than a healthy skeleton. While foods like oily fish, eggs and artificially reinforced powdered milk, bread and breakfast cereals can supply some of our daily requirements, most — about 80 per cent — comes from internal production in our skin, driven by the action of sunlight. Hence the nickname “sunshine vitamin”. However, in the UK the sun isn’t powerful enough for much of the year to fuel the process and levels dip dramatically in the darker, cloudier winter months. And the further north you live in the UK, the bigger the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/vitamin-d-supplements-ageing-cch2j258r" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vitamin D supplements could counter ageing, study suggests&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;All of which is compounded if you have dark skin, or cover up/use high SPF sunscreens to protect yourself. Little wonder, then, that deficiency is common. Estimates vary but guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) suggests that over the whole year about 23 per cent of 19 to 64-year-olds in the UK have vitamin D deficiency (a blood level under 25 nmol/L), rising closer to about 40 per cent between January and March. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Hence long-established, yet widely ignored, guidelines advocating that everyone takes supplements (typically 10mcg or 400iu a day over the age of one) from October to March, and throughout the rest of the year for other groups such as children, pregnant women, those who don’t see much sun or have darker skin. I follow this guidance, but is it doing me any good?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Just because lower levels of vitamin D are associated with an increased risk of a range of illnesses doesn’t mean that supplementation will protect against them. Numerous trials have concluded just this, with the consensus being that taking extra vitamin D doesn’t, in general, significantly reduce your risk of a heart attack or stroke, or of developing cancer, and autoimmune conditions like multiple sclerosis or type 1 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Covid is one example of this apparent paradox. While research during the pandemic suggested that people with low levels of vitamin D were more likely to develop serious chest complications, it’s still not clear if supplementation improves outcomes (some studies suggest it does, others that it doesn’t).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more expert advice on healthy living, fitness and wellbeing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;There are a number of reasons that the results of much of the research into protective effects of vitamin D have been inconclusive or disappointing. Low levels of the vitamin can be a marker of poor general health — they tend to be lower in some higher-risk groups such as the obese and those with some types of kidney and liver disease — and supplements won’t change this. There is also still some controversy over what constitutes healthy levels, with a large grey area between recognised deficiency and normal readings. And many of the studies include people with varying levels of the vitamin (some normal). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Could part of the problem be that supplements may help to ward off long-term illnesses in the minority at the lower end of the spectrum, while doing little or nothing for the majority towards the upper end? We know that they work well in extreme examples like rickets (where the bones “soften” due to vitamin D deficiency), but that doesn’t automatically translate into a stronger skeleton for the rest of us. Or, as a vitamin D researcher once told me “putting more petrol in your car won’t make it perform any better, Mark, but you don’t want to run out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I am clear on one thing: vitamin D deficiency is best avoided and it is common. So I will carry on taking my supplements (I take 20mcg/800iu of D3 a day) during the darker months. They are cheap, and safe in sensible dosage. And I would advise that you do the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;To test, or not to test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• My local NHS laboratory uses the following reference ranges for vitamin D blood tests. Over 50 nmol/L = adequate, 25-50nmol/L = insufficiency, under 25 nmol/L = severe deficiency.&lt;br&gt;• Nice advises against routine testing of vitamin D levels unless someone has suspected or confirmed osteoporosis and other bone disease, or unexplained chronic widespread pain. &lt;br&gt;• Rather than test those at high risk of deficiency because of lifestyle or underlying medical conditions, Nice says they should be advised to take supplements.&lt;br&gt;• If you still want to know your level, DIY home tests are available. Boots sells one for £7.99.&lt;br&gt;• Recent research suggests that weaker sunscreens (SPF15 or below) do not interfere with vitamin D production in most users (you need surprisingly little sun exposure to meet demand). Higher SPFs do — another reason to consider supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="paywall-portal-article-footer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixgFBVV95cUxPREJjel96N0JjRHBXWFJOTUdxVlpLYXl6elB1bUV4QjdEaGRKNzJvX0tZMXY1TWhnMDY0WUtpa1BLdUo4c0N0RktEU1BGWFFOTDFXNEZzRllWbVhESjdueGlEYzhsU2NjNjNHbl81WFJ3TkhEZVBHWWlSX1JkVy1hOVJ2RWV3NzhYREswaERTNWVfVnp5a1BnSWNzdjQ2WVQ2T3JTMmkxcWRLamhHMUxiby1Ca09kX055OWFjNmcyeDVpZjQ3Z0E</guid></item><item><title>这个消息可能会毁了你的胃口和夏天-坦帕湾时报 | This news might ruin your appetite — and summer - Tampa Bay Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxOQ1RIMmxfdlUtNlI3Q054VldzRG5lQVp1ek9kcXZNMVNiUkhrM0p0SndUWTVDMzlEU1VMbHczTnB6d25qS1gyMWlEbFAteE4yV2c2UW1lSmlYR0hRaG5nQ0RGNVQtV0tqWTUtOEMwWjVXb3NndVRWVzRWWllrd1ZBNEI1bDBTWHdwdDNlVWFBblo4X1JE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;It’s a marvel of food technology: ice cream that resists melting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;In a video explaining the science behind it, a seller of &lt;a href="https://modernistpantry.com/categories/ingredients.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;food chemicals&lt;/a&gt; shows scoops of ice cream holding their shape under &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfn0zv1wyJQ&amp;amp;t=185s" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;hot lights&lt;/a&gt;. The super ingredient? Polysorbate 80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Polysorbate 80 is an emulsifier, a chemical used to control the consistency of thousands of supermarket products. Other widely used emulsifiers or stabilizers include carboxymethyl cellulose, carrageenan, and maltodextrin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Recently, such ingredients have been showing up in scientific studies for another reason: Researchers say they may cause a variety of health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Studies have found that emulsifiers can &lt;a href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-020-00996-6" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;alter the mix&lt;/a&gt; of bacteria &lt;a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(21)03728-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;in the gut&lt;/a&gt;, known as the microbiome or microbiota; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8963984/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;damage the lining&lt;/a&gt; of the gastrointestinal tract; and &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ecco-jcc/article/15/6/1068/6041235" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;trigger inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, potentially contributing to &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004338" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00086-X/fulltext" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/382/bmj-2023-076058" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;in the body&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Emulsifiers and stabilizers are among the most common ingredients in ultraprocessed foods, a prime target of the “Make America Healthy Again” campaign by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;They are on the department’s radar: Their potentially harmful effects were &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/Review-of-Compounds-in-Ultra-Processed-Foods.docx" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;flagged in a document&lt;/a&gt; HHS recently produced to support Kennedy’s drive to eliminate petroleum-based food dyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But they illustrate the complexity of the war on food additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;They show how, when it comes to food science, regulators are chronically playing catch-up. In the meantime, for many ingredients, regulators and consumers alike are left in a gray zone between suspicion and proof of harm in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Emulsifiers’ assault on the microbiome could help explain inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, metabolic disorders, and even cancer, the studies suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“There is a lot of data showing that those compounds are really detrimental for the microbiota and that we should stop using them,” said Benoit Chassaing, a research director at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research and a co-author of several related studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Yet much larger and more ambitious clinical trials in humans are needed, Chassaing added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;For Lewis Rands, who has suffered from gastrointestinal illness, the research fits his own experience as a consumer. Changing his diet to avoid emulsifiers has made a shocking difference, easing symptoms that were debilitating, Rands said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“Clinically, many patients have reported an improvement in symptoms with such changes,” said Ashwin Ananthakrishnan, a gastroenterologist and researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The scientific findings come with caveats. For instance, much of the research has been done in mice, or by mimicking the human gut in a tube. There are many unknowns. Not all emulsifiers have bad effects, or the same effects, and some people are thought to be much more vulnerable than others. Even some researchers who have co-authored papers say that the substances have not been proven harmful to humans and that it’s too soon to say regulators should ban them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fXDgxBh article start my-32"&gt;&lt;p class="fXDgxBh__image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fXDgxBh__content"&gt;&lt;div class="fXDgxBh__stage--start"&gt;&lt;h2 class="fXDgxBh__headline"&gt;Keep up with Tampa Bay’s top headlines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="fXDgxBh__subheadline"&gt;Subscribe to our free DayStarter newsletter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="fXDgxBh__blurb"&gt;We’ll deliver the latest news and information you need to know every morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="fXDgxBh__stage--finish"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 25" class="fXDgxBh__success-icon"&gt;&lt;path d="M9.6 18.326L3.6 12.326L5.292 10.622L9.6 14.93L18.708 5.82205L20.4 7.52605L9.6 18.326ZM12 0.32605C10.4241 0.32605 8.86371 0.636439 7.4078 1.2395C5.95189 1.84255 4.62902 2.72647 3.51472 3.84077C1.26428 6.09121 0 9.14345 0 12.326C0 15.5086 1.26428 18.5609 3.51472 20.8113C4.62902 21.9256 5.95189 22.8095 7.4078 23.4126C8.86371 24.0157 10.4241 24.326 12 24.326C15.1826 24.326 18.2348 23.0618 20.4853 20.8113C22.7357 18.5609 24 15.5086 24 12.326C24 10.7502 23.6896 9.18976 23.0866 7.73385C22.4835 6.27794 21.5996 4.95507 20.4853 3.84077C19.371 2.72647 18.0481 1.84255 16.5922 1.2395C15.1363 0.636439 13.5759 0.32605 12 0.32605Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;h2 class="fXDgxBh__headline"&gt;You’re all signed up!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="fXDgxBh__blurb"&gt;Want more of our free, weekly newsletters in your inbox? &lt;strong&gt;Let’s get started.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/newsletters/" class="ui__button--call-to-action" data-tbtevent="link" data-tbtcategory="Newsletter Sign Up Form" data-tbtlabel='{"element":"All newsletters link"}'&gt;Explore all your options&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 19 19" class="fXDgxBh__link-icon"&gt;&lt;path d="M18.2334 9.32605C18.2334 11.713 17.2852 14.0022 15.5974 15.69C13.9095 17.3778 11.6203 18.326 9.2334 18.326C8.0515 18.326 6.88118 18.0933 5.78925 17.641C4.69732 17.1887 3.70516 16.5257 2.86944 15.69C1.18161 14.0022 0.233398 11.713 0.233398 9.32605C0.233398 6.9391 1.18161 4.64992 2.86944 2.96209C4.55726 1.27426 6.84645 0.32605 9.2334 0.32605C10.4153 0.32605 11.5856 0.558842 12.6775 1.01113C13.7695 1.46343 14.7616 2.12636 15.5974 2.96209C16.4331 3.79782 17.096 4.78997 17.5483 5.8819C18.0006 6.97383 18.2334 8.14415 18.2334 9.32605ZM3.8334 10.226H11.0334L7.8834 13.376L9.1614 14.654L14.4894 9.32605L9.1614 3.99805L7.8834 5.27605L11.0334 8.42605H3.8334V10.226Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Still, the research poses a challenge for the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;When emulsifiers began spreading through the food supply, the agency wasn’t focusing on the gut microbiome, a relatively recent scientific frontier, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Martin Makary, appointed by President Donald Trump to head the FDA, mentioned the microbiome &lt;a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/hearings/nomination-of-martin-makary-to-serve-as-commissioner-of-food-and-drugs" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;at his Senate confirmation hearing&lt;/a&gt; in March. Though he didn’t cite emulsifiers specifically or identify chemicals by name, he said substances that affect the microbiome deserve the FDA’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“There’s a body of research now that suggests concern with some of these ingredients,” he said. “We have to look at those ingredients, and you have my commitment to do so if confirmed as FDA commissioner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“These chemicals are creating an inflammatory response in the gastrointestinal tract, and with an altered microbiome lining that GI tract, kids feel sick,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to questions about Makary’s testimony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;However, when journalist &lt;a href="https://x.com/emilyakopp/status/1914813503640129724" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Emily Kopp&lt;/a&gt; asked HHS for the science behind its recent announcement that it is phasing out petroleum-based food dyes, the agency provided a compilation of information on potentially harmful compounds commonly found in ultraprocessed foods. The document, which appeared to be a draft, included a section on emulsifiers, such as xanthan gum and carrageenan. It noted that the section needed more work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;HHS subsequently provided the document to KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;As far back as 2020, an international organization for the &lt;a href="https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(20)30185-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;study of inflammatory bowel diseases advised&lt;/a&gt; that, for people with those conditions, it “may be prudent to limit intake” of maltodextrin, carrageenan, carboxymethyl cellulose, and polysorbate 80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Emulsifiers are developed from a variety of sources, including plants and bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Some ingredients that might affect the microbiome show up in foods because they were deemed “generally recognized as safe,” or GRAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“New information may at any time require reconsideration of the GRAS status of a food ingredient,” the &lt;a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/part-170/section-170.30#p-170.30(l)" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Code of Federal Regulations&lt;/a&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body-html raw-html"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YYklGcYNfV4?si=PYM_GG4DeJ9wMhgW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘More of a difference than any drug’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Rands, a genetic scientist, took matters into his own hands to battle severe inflammatory bowel disease. The illness caused bloating, stomach pain, cramps, frequent bowel movements, and bleeding, he said. It left him in a constant state of anxiety and stress, he added, wondering where the nearest bathroom was and whether he’d reach it in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Even taking a walk around the block with his wife and baby near their home in Australia was problematic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Then, on the advice of a dietitian, Rands began avoiding foods with emulsifiers: chemicals such as carboxymethyl cellulose, carrageenan, guar gum, xanthan gum, and maltodextrin — plus other additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;For instance, instead of eating Ben &amp;amp; Jerry’s ice cream, he switched to Häagen-Dazs ice cream that is free of the substances at issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The relief was dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“It’s a huge difference,” Rands said. “To me, it’s made more of a difference than any drug.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Lewis Rands, whose gastrointestinal illness had been debilitating, says changing his diet to avoid emulsifiers has improved his life dramatically. Now, for instance, he can take long walks with his family.(Roisin Rands)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;He has been able to scale back or stop taking several drugs, which is an added relief — not least because some can have harmful side effects, and, he said, one was taking its toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Rands said he used a scientific approach, isolating variables in his diet and logging the results. Avoiding artificial sweeteners helps, he said, but most of the benefit relates to avoiding the emulsifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Ben &amp;amp; Jerry’s did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Science that hasn’t been done yet’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The Consumer Brands Association, which represents makers of processed foods, stands behind use of the chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“Food safety and protecting the integrity of the food supply is priority number one for the makers of America’s food and beverage products,” Sarah Gallo, the group’s senior vice president of product policy, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“Emulsifiers and thickening agents play an important role in improving food texture and consistency, and have been studied by the FDA through a rigorous scientific and risk-based process,” Gallo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Asked for specifics on how the FDA had analyzed potential effects on the microbiome, the group did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Chassaing said the chemicals were “never considered for the potential effect on the microbiota.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Robert Califf, who led the FDA under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, said in an interview that scientists are just beginning to understand the microbiome. He compared it to where the field of genomics was 20 years ago, only much more complicated — “multiplied by a thousand dimensions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;He said the substances “fell within the standards” when they were greenlighted. “But hopefully most people agree that the standards need to be upgraded,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“This is different than traditional food safety thinking about, ‘Does it cause an immediate problem?’” Califf said. “We’re talking about long-term health outcomes here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And has the FDA evaluated those?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“How could it? There was no way to do it,” Califf said. The answers will vary depending on the emulsifier, and “proving whether it’s bad or good is going to require rigorous science that hasn’t been done yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;More recent scientific capabilities expand the possibilities, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘A lot of confusion in the field’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;For a consumer, trying to steer clear of emulsifiers can be difficult. Without realizing it, people can consume a variety of emulsifiers from a variety of foods — and the same chemicals from multiple sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Polysorbate 80 was listed as an ingredient on the labels of &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/foodscores/ingredients/17682-POLYSORBATE80/search/?page=1&amp;amp;per_page=12&amp;amp;type=products" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;2,311 products&lt;/a&gt; as of May 12, according to an online database posted by the Environmental Working Group using information from NielsenIQ. Carrageenan was listed on &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/foodscores/ingredients/7365-Carrageenan/search/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;8,100 product labels&lt;/a&gt;; maltodextrin, &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/foodscores/ingredients/7344-Maltodextrin/search/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;12,769&lt;/a&gt;; and xanthan gum, &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/foodscores/ingredients/7340-XanthanGum/search/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;17,153&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Some emulsifiers have multiple names, making them harder to recognize. Some names can apply to more than one emulsifier. And some chemical names that appear on product labels don’t appear in the FDA’s “&lt;a href="https://www.hfpappexternal.fda.gov/scripts/fdcc/index.cfm?set=FoodSubstances" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Substances Added to Food&lt;/a&gt;” inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Carboxymethyl cellulose — not to be confused with methyl cellulose — is also known as carboxymethylcellulose and cellulose gum. Maltodextrin can be derived from substances such as cornstarch, rice starch, and wheat starch — but the FDA doesn’t consider it synonymous with the term “modified food starch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The naming practices can frustrate efforts to track the chemicals in food, to measure how much of the stuff people are taking in, and even to figure out precisely which chemicals a scientific study evaluated, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“There’s a lot of confusion in the field,” said Christine McDonald, a researcher at the Cleveland Clinic who has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8963984/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;studied maltodextrin&lt;/a&gt;. She called for more consistent naming of additives in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The very term “emulsifier” is problematic. By strict definition, emulsifiers create an emulsion — a stable blend of liquids that would not otherwise mix, such as oil and water. However, the term is used broadly, encompassing chemicals &lt;a href="https://www.hfpappexternal.fda.gov/scripts/fdcc/index.cfm?set=FoodSubstances&amp;amp;id=MALTODEXTRIN" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;such as maltodextrin&lt;/a&gt; that thicken, stabilize, or alter texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gummed up&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Emulsifiers can be found in foods marketed as natural or healthy as well as ones that look artificial. Some products contain multiple emulsifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Products sold at Whole Foods, for instance, list a variety of emulsifiers on their labels. 365 brand Organic Vegan Ranch Dressing &amp;amp; Dip contained organic tapioca maltodextrin and xanthan gum. Pacific Seafood Starfish brand Cornmeal Crusted Fishsticks — marked as wild-caught and MSC-certified (sustainably sourced) — contain guar gum. Flour tortillas by 365 included monoglycerides of fatty acids and “stabilizer (guar gum, xanthan gum, carrageenan).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;At a Safeway supermarket, Healthy Choice Grilled Chicken Pesto With Vegetables listed modified potato starch, modified corn starch, carrageenan, xanthan gum, and guar gum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The label on Newman’s Own Caesar salad dressing said the product contained no artificial preservatives or flavors, no colors from an artificial source, and was gluten-free. The ingredient label listed, “as a thickener,” xanthan gum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;In response to questions for this article, Whole Foods Market &lt;a href="https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/quality-standards/food-ingredient-standards" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;said it prohibits&lt;/a&gt; more than 300 ingredients commonly found in food. “Our experts evaluate ingredients for acceptability in all food products we sell based on the best available scientific research,” the company said in a statement provided by spokesperson Rachel Malish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Safeway’s parent company, Albertsons Companies, did not respond to inquiries. Nor did Pacific Seafood, Newman’s Own, or Conagra Brands, which makes Healthy Choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A growing body of research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Research on emulsifiers has been building in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;For example, a study published in January by the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ecco-jcc/article/19/Supplement_1/i262/7967009" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Journal of Crohn’s and Colitis&lt;/a&gt; concluded that a diet low in emulsifiers is an effective treatment for mild or moderate Crohn’s disease. The eight-week clinical trial, which tracked 154 patients in the United Kingdom, focused on carrageenan, carboxymethyl cellulose, and polysorbate 80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;A study published in February 2024 in the journal &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004338" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found that higher intakes of carrageenan and mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids were associated with higher risks of cancer. The study observed 92,000 French adults for an average of 6.7 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;A study published in September 2023 in &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/382/bmj-2023-076058" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;The BMJ&lt;/a&gt;, formerly known as the British Medical Journal, found that intake of several types of emulsifiers was associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease. The study observed more than 95,000 French adults for a median of 7.4 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;A series of earlier studies found that emulsifiers “can promote chronic intestinal inflammation in mice”; that two in particular, carboxymethyl cellulose and polysorbate 80, “profoundly impact intestinal microbiota in a manner that promotes gut inflammation and associated disease states”; and that, based on a laboratory study of human samples, “numerous, but not all, commonly used emulsifiers can directly alter gut microbiota in a manner expected to promote intestinal inflammation,” as recounted in a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7986288/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;2021 paper&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Other findings diverge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;A study from Australia, published in February in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11950802/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics&lt;/a&gt;, followed 24 Crohn’s patients over four weeks and concluded that, in the context of a healthy diet, the emulsifier content had “no influence over disease activity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Authors declared &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11950802/#apt70041-sec-0036" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;conflicts of interest&lt;/a&gt;, including payments from PepsiCo, drug companies, and Mindset Health Pty, which promotes hypnosis-based therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;One of the authors, gastroenterology professor Peter Gibson of Monash University in Australia, said the conflicts of interest “have nothing whatsoever to do with the study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“It is important not to overinterpret results of studies,” he said, adding that his team’s report “does not mean that emulsifiers are good for you or that there are no health benefits in avoiding emulsifiers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h1"&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Keeping it real’ (or not)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Häagen-Dazs touts the absence of such chemicals as a virtue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“Keeping it real, the way it should be,” it said in an &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/936078062067805" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;online plug&lt;/a&gt; for its vanilla ice cream. “No emulsifiers. No stabilizers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;However, at the company that makes Häagen-Dazs in the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.dreyersgrandicecream.com/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Dreyer’s Grand Ice Cream&lt;/a&gt;, there are limits to that approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Under other brand names — such as Edy’s, Dreyer’s, and &lt;a href="https://www.icecream.com/us/en/brands/drumstick/products/all" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Drumstick&lt;/a&gt; — it markets products that contain emulsifiers or stabilizers. The company did not respond to questions. In addition, a spokesperson for Nestlé, which markets Drumstick and Häagen-Dazs brands internationally, did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Drumstick Vanilla Caramel Sundae Cones have no artificial flavors or colors, the package says — but they feature an array of other ingredients, including soy lecithin, guar gum, monogylcerides, and carob bean gum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The cones, the &lt;a href="https://www.icecream.com/us/en/brands/drumstick/products/vanilla-caramel-sundae-cone" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;company’s website says&lt;/a&gt;, offer “one incredibly creamy experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And the creamy filling doesn’t melt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Instead, over 24 hours on a KFF Health News reporter’s kitchen counter, it bled a caramel-tinged fluid and shrank into a sticky white foam that could be cut with a knife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Tampa Bay Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 14:16:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOQ1RIMmxfdlUtNlI3Q054VldzRG5lQVp1ek9kcXZNMVNiUkhrM0p0SndUWTVDMzlEU1VMbHczTnB6d25qS1gyMWlEbFAteE4yV2c2UW1lSmlYR0hRaG5nQ0RGNVQtV0tqWTUtOEMwWjVXb3NndVRWVzRWWllrd1ZBNEI1bDBTWHdwdDNlVWFBblo4X1JE</guid></item><item><title>专家说，女性经常因慢性妇科疼痛而面临医用煤气灯照明- CNN | Women often face medical gaslighting for chronic gynecological pain, experts say - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxNTkVsNnpoSXUyaVh2RnNiamJZMXJheTRCc3RTSF82T0c4NlNjTzdISG9wSnhlcV9QQU92T051Ri1WMmFKR19XTzE2bk5mNElHczQwd20zNDlCSnVUS2dLbkZsZTFaallJWFlFX01BTW1BNnpmUGtGQXBJLVRqQmpEenY2dWZ4eDRWMXpJcjZLVjbSAZYBQVVfeXFMT2dqUlItcjBHMXRvNEh0c2xaMW9YU1A3b09nNW5aNmVmRkl1bnM4RWlIcWtXREU0LUZYelVoa2VCdHRRTzZyXzlmWE9Gc3NMcGhNcl9jMklpLVZuSkpBLW1BMUd4LS1wMDFsbXZnWUp3eHBESUNscTRPUGotTUY4QlZtcWVHTk9oZlJOc2hvdEdNTnVjNlB3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            For people with chronic gynecological pain conditions, pain can be constant, making everyday activities like sitting, riding a bicycle and even wearing underwear extremely uncomfortable. For many of these people — most of whom identify as women — sexual intercourse and routine pelvic exams are unbearable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvn00023j6nqjcf7ssm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

They each affect about 1 in 10 American women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Yet many women face skepticism and gaslighting in health care settings when they seek care for this type of pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            We know this well through our research on &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;amp;user=Yl7YjrIAAAAJ" target="_blank"&gt;social cognition&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;amp;user=ByZ6qXEAAAAJ" target="_blank"&gt;how people with misunderstood health conditions&lt;/a&gt; manage difficult conversations with their doctors and family, as well as through volunteer work alongside people living with these conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvn00053j6nz32xn7n2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We’ve consistently found that medical gaslighting around chronic gynecological pain is a complex societal problem, fueled by holes in medical research and training.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvn00063j6n3ho0bnjj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A 2024 study of patients who went to a clinic for vulvovaginal pain — pain experienced in the external female genitals and vagina –- found that 45% of these patients had been told that they “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jsxmed/qdae054.081" target="_blank"&gt;just needed to relax more&lt;/a&gt;” and 39% were made to feel that they were “crazy.” A staggering 55% had considered giving up on seeking care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvn00073j6nzhwytske@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These results echo what one of us — Elizabeth Hintz — found in her 2023 meta-synthesis: Female patients with chronic pain conditions frequently hear this “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2022.2081046" target="_blank"&gt;it’s all in your head&lt;/a&gt;” response from doctors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvn00083j6n4n0c4ntt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another study followed patients in two different major US cities who were seeking care for vulvovaginal pain. The researchers found that most patients saw multiple clinicians but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2013.09.033" target="_blank"&gt;never received a diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;. Given the challenges of seeking medical care, many patients turn to social &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2196/63072" target="_blank"&gt;media sources like Reddit for support and information&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo00093j6nctn1df3u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These studies, among others, illustrate how people with these conditions often spend years going to clinician after clinician seeking care and being told their pain is psychological or perhaps not even real. Given these experiences, why do patients keep seeking care?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000a3j6nzbt08uc4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Let me describe the pain that would drive me to try so many different doctors, tests and treatments,” &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jsm.12167" target="_blank"&gt;a patient with vulvovaginal pain&lt;/a&gt; said to her doctor. For her, sex “is like taking your most sensitive area and trying to rip it apart.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000b3j6nzfjjasdm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I can now wear any pants or underwear that I want with no pain,” said another patient after successful treatment. “I never realized how much of a toll the pain took on my body every day until it was gone.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Many &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2024.06.022" target="_blank"&gt;patients worldwide experience medical gaslighting&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0022146510383495" target="_blank"&gt;a social phenomenon&lt;/a&gt; where a patient’s health concerns are not given appropriate medical evaluation and are instead downplayed, misattributed or dismissed outright.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000d3j6nt9lti3gb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Medical gaslighting is rooted in centuries of gender bias in medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000e3j6netme1bkm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Women’s reproductive health issues have long been dismissed as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jahist/jaad001" target="_blank"&gt;psychological or “hysterical.”&lt;/a&gt; Genital and pelvic pain especially has been misattributed to psychological rather than biological causes: A century ago, Freudian psychoanalysts incorrectly believed that female sexual pain came from psychological complexes like penis envy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000f3j6n3bcf24oj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These historical views help shed light on why these symptoms are still not taken seriously today.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000g3j6nrgtqna5b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to the physical toll of untreated pain, medical gaslighting can take &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmn.2010.09.001" target="_blank"&gt;a psychological toll&lt;/a&gt;. Women may become &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/hcr/hqad004" target="_blank"&gt;isolated when other people do not believe their pain&lt;/a&gt;. Some internalize this disbelief and can begin to doubt their own perceptions of pain and even their sanity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000h3j6nivpuxwbd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This cycle of gaslighting compounds the burden of the pain and might lead to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.52053/jpap.v5i1.249" target="_blank"&gt;long-term psychological effects&lt;/a&gt; like anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms. For some, the repeated experience of being dismissed by clinicians &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2025.108701" target="_blank"&gt;erodes their sense of trust&lt;/a&gt; in the health care system. They might hesitate to seek medical attention in the future, fearing they will once again be dismissed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000i3j6nt9sthou3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although some chronic gynecological pain conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.endofound.org/" target="_blank"&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/doing-harm-maya-dusenbery?variant=41000001798178" target="_blank"&gt;gaining public attention&lt;/a&gt; and becoming better understood, these dynamics persist.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000j3j6n9i0nxx2p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Part of the reason for the misunderstanding surrounding chronic gynecological pain conditions is the lack of research on them. A January report from the National Academies found that research on &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28586/a-new-vision-for-womens-health-research-transformative-change-at" target="_blank"&gt;diseases disproportionately affecting women were underfunded&lt;/a&gt; compared with diseases disproportionately affecting men.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000k3j6nvkaycwom@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This problem has gotten worse over time. The proportion of funding from the National Institutes of Health spent on women’s health has actually &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28586/a-new-vision-for-womens-health-research-transformative-change-at" target="_blank"&gt;declined over the past decade&lt;/a&gt;. Despite these known disparities, in April the Trump administration threatened to end funding for the Women’s Health Initiative, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/the-womens-health-initiative-has-shaped-womens-health-for-over-30-years-but-its-future-is-uncertain-255311" target="_blank"&gt;a long-running women’s health research program&lt;/a&gt;, further worsening the problem.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000l3j6nj8oanru3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Without sustained federal funding for women’s health research, conditions like endometriosis and vulvodynia will remain poorly understood, leaving clinicians in the dark and patients stranded.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000m3j6no8nvvedv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As hard as it is for any female patient to have their pain believed and treated, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.03.048" target="_blank"&gt;gaining recognition for chronic pain&lt;/a&gt; is even harder for those who face discrimination based on class or race.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000n3j6nxk1ifsg9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One 2016 study found that half of the white medical students surveyed &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1516047113" target="_blank"&gt;endorsed at least one false belief&lt;/a&gt; about biological differences between Black and white patients, such as that Black people have physically thicker skin or less sensitive nerve endings than white people. The medical students and residents who endorsed these false beliefs also underestimated Black patients’ pain and offered them less accurate treatment recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000o3j6n4583k92s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Studies show that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2025.01.005" target="_blank"&gt;women are more likely to develop chronic pain conditions&lt;/a&gt; and report &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2024.102558" target="_blank"&gt;more frequent and severe pain&lt;/a&gt; than men. But women are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000536" target="_blank"&gt;perceived as more emotional&lt;/a&gt; and thus less reliable in describing their pain than men. Consequently, female patients who describe the same symptoms as male patients are judged to be in less pain and are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5465/AMPROC.2024.12304abstract" target="_blank"&gt;less likely to be offered pain relief&lt;/a&gt;, even in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2401331121" target="_blank"&gt;emergency settings and with female clinicians&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to male patients, female patients are more likely to be prescribed &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpain.2021.03.001" target="_blank"&gt;psychological care instead of pain medicine&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000p3j6nldblourr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These lingering erroneous beliefs about gender and race are key reasons patients’ pain is dismissed, misunderstood and ignored. The very real-life consequences for patients include delayed diagnosis, treatment and even death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000q3j6nbso3wjfb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Correcting these problems will require a shift in clinical training, so as to challenge biased views about pain in women and racial minorities and to educate clinicians about common pain conditions like vulvodynia. Research suggests that medical training needs to teach students to better listen to patients’ lived experiences and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/23743735241252475" target="_blank"&gt;admit when an answer isn’t known&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In the meantime, people navigating the health care system can take practical steps when encountering dismissive care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cman12jvo000s3j6nqxh6ah7z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They can educate themselves about chronic gynecological pain conditions by reading books like “&lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/andrew-goldstein-md/when-sex-hurts/9780306827419/?lens=balance" target="_blank"&gt;When Sex Hurts: Understanding and Healing Pelvic Pain&lt;/a&gt;” or educational information from trusted sources like the &lt;a href="https://www.prosayla.com/" target="_blank"&gt;International Society for the Study of Women’s Sexual Health&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.pelvicpain.org/public/resources/educational-resources/informational-handouts" target="_blank"&gt;International Pelvic Pain Society&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.issvd.org/publications/patient-handouts" target="_blank"&gt;International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease&lt;/a&gt;.

            Although these steps do not address the roots of medical gaslighting, they can empower patients to better understand the medical conditions that could cause their symptoms, helping to counteract the effects of gaslighting.

Additionally, connecting with patient advocacy groups like &lt;a href="https://www.tightlipped.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Tight Lipped&lt;/a&gt; can provide opportunities for patients to engage in changing the health care system.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-204f2610-3a2e-11f0-9258-879da2e46d67"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; estimates 180,000 Americans are struck by hepatitis A every year, many of whom have no symptoms, which include fever, nausea, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine and hives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease spreads when infected stool enters a person's mouth, often by eating or drinking contaminated food or water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also may spread through kissing, hugging, sharing utensils or having sex with an infected person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once the virus enters the body, it infects liver cells and causes inflammation. Most cases go away on their own with no permanent damage, but it could take up to six months for symptoms to disappear entirely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no treatment for the condition other than antibody therapy and vaccines within two weeks of exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Paul Sax, clinical director of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/hepatitis-a-provincetown-outbreak-massachusetts/"&gt;local news&lt;/a&gt;: 'It's not the kind of illness like a typical food poisoning where you're sick for one or two days, then you're back to normal within a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Usually, people with hepatitis A, at least the people who get diagnosed, are out for two to three weeks, sometimes longer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In extremely rare cases - one in 5million people - the infection can be fatal due to severe liver failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Massachusetts health officials urged people who may have been exposed to get vaccinated within two weeks, as the first dose is only effective for that period.

Using transparent zebrafish, scientists observed that these immune cells contain internal circadian clocks that are activated by light, boosting their bacterial-killing ability during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This synchronization between daylight and immune response suggests an evolutionary adaptation to better defend against infections encountered during periods of activity. The findings could lead to new therapies that optimize immune function by targeting these cellular clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neutrophil Clocks:&lt;/strong&gt; Neutrophils possess circadian clocks that respond to daylight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peak Immunity Timing:&lt;/strong&gt; Immune responses are stronger during daytime activity phases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting neutrophil clocks may enhance treatment for infections and inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Auckland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A breakthrough study, led by scientists at Waipapa Taumata Rau, University of Auckland, has uncovered how daylight can boost the immune system’s ability to fight infections.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team focused on the most abundant immune cells in our bodies, called ‘neutrophils’, which are a type of white blood cell. These cells move quickly to the site of an infection and kill invading bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used zebrafish, a small freshwater fish, as a model organism, because its genetic make-up is similar to ours and they can be bred to have transparent bodies, making it easy to observe biological processes in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In earlier studies, we had observed that immune responses peaked in the morning, during the fish’s early active phase,” says lead researcher Associate Professor Christopher Hall, from the Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think this represents an evolutionary response such that during daylight hours the host is more active so more likely to encounter bacterial infections,” says Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the scientists wanted to find out how the immune response was being synchronised with daylight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this new study, published in &lt;em&gt;Science Immunology&lt;/em&gt;, and led by two doctoral researchers, neutrophils were found to possess a circadian clock that alerted them to daytime, and boosted their ability to kill bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of our cells have circadian clocks to tell them what time of day it is in the outside world, in order to regulate the body’s activities. Light has the biggest influence on resetting these circadian clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given that neutrophils are the first immune cells to be recruited to sites of inflammation, our discovery has very broad implications for therapeutic benefit in many inflammatory diseases,” Hall says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This finding paves the way for development of drugs that target the circadian clock in neutrophils to boost their ability to fight infections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded through the Royal Society of NZ’s Marsden Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current research is now focussed on understanding the specific mechanisms by which light influences the neutrophil circadian clock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this circadian rhythm and immune system research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#197e70757b7c6b6d376e76777e59786c7a727578777d37787a377763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gilbert Wong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://auckland.ac.nz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Auckland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Gilbert Wong – University of Auckland&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.adn3080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A light-regulated circadian timer optimizes neutrophil bactericidal activity to boost daytime immunity&lt;/a&gt;” by Christopher Hall et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Immunology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A light-regulated circadian timer optimizes neutrophil bactericidal activity to boost daytime immunity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune response exhibits strong circadian rhythmicity, with enhanced bacterial clearance often synchronized with an organism’s active phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite providing the bulk of cellular antibacterial defense, the neutrophil clockwork is poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we used larval zebrafish to explore the role of clock genes in neutrophils during infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Per2&lt;/em&gt; was required in neutrophils for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and bacterial killing by enhancing infection-responsive expression of &lt;em&gt;high-mobility group box 1a&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;hmgb1a&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cry binding domain of Per2 was required for regulation of neutrophil bactericidal activity, and neutrophils lacking Cry1a had elevated bactericidal activity and infection-responsive &lt;em&gt;hmgb1a&lt;/em&gt; expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A conserved cis-regulatory element with BMAL1 and nuclear factor κB binding motifs gated infection-responsive &lt;em&gt;hmgb1a&lt;/em&gt; expression to the light phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutagenesis of the BMAL1 motif in neutrophils blunted the priming effect of light on bactericidal activity and &lt;em&gt;hmgb1a&lt;/em&gt; expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings identify a light-responsive cell-intrinsic timer that controls time-of-day variations in antibacterial activity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 12:56:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9OZWd3cloxRzluSUNmSGhmV0xjU1ZNNUZnajJDVGxGcEJfWW56WVRjN3FHZTlpSXRnbmVRbGpiMmhSUDJYQ3VDemJqNm56eEk5UWMtVTdvMEtvNTVoLW4wQ2EtcThWa01Vbmc</guid></item><item><title>脑干神经元是Semaglutide减肥效果的关键-神经科学新闻 | Brainstem Neurons Hold Key to Semaglutide’s Weight Loss Effects - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTE9kZ1pfYmZxQjRkYlllTklCMGYyVlR2bF9YQVdSNGZsZHhxQlNha2lVS0h6T3ZhdlZ6d0Q3bGdnLUxhallaMlZfYzNQTWtJRXlFYzhtOUprMTBYazZjWDY1bkdGcUtKSVlUOVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have identified a specific group of brainstem neurons that mediate the appetite-reducing and weight-loss effects of semaglutide without triggering side effects like nausea. In mice, activating these neurons led to reduced food intake and fat loss, mimicking the drug’s benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, disabling them diminished semaglutide’s effects on weight, but not its adverse symptoms. This discovery could lead to more targeted obesity treatments that preserve the benefits of GLP-1R agonists while minimizing discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Neurons:&lt;/strong&gt; A specific set of neurons in the dorsal vagal complex mediate semaglutide’s appetite-suppressing effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side Effect Separation:&lt;/strong&gt; These neurons are not significantly involved in side effects like nausea or muscle loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting these neurons could enhance obesity treatments while reducing unwanted symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Gothenburg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A specific group of nerve cells in the brain stem appears to control how semaglutide affects appetite and weight – without causing nausea. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery, made at the University of Gothenburg, could pave the way for better drugs to treat obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide belongs to a group of drugs called GLP-1R agonists and has been shown to effectively reduce food intake and body weight. The drug is already well established as part of the treatment for obesity and type 2 diabetes, but can cause side effects such as nausea and muscle loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110399"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/semaglutide-dorsal-vagal-complex-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When these nerve cells were killed, the drug’s effect on appetite and fat loss instead decreased significantly. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers at the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg have shown that it is possible to distinguish the nerve cells in the brain that control the beneficial effects – such as reduced food intake and fat loss – from those that contribute to side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activated nerve cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate how semaglutide affects the brain, the researchers worked with mice. They tracked which nerve cells were activated by the drug and were then able to stimulate these cells – without administering the drug itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result was that the mice ate less and lost weight, just as they did when treated with semaglutide. When these nerve cells were killed, the drug’s effect on appetite and fat loss instead decreased significantly. However, side effects such as nausea and muscle loss remained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that these nerve cells control the beneficial effects of semaglutide. We have therefore identified a specific group of nerve cells that is necessary for the effects that semaglutide has on weight and appetite, but which does not appear to contribute to any significant extent to side effects such as nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can target the treatment there, we may be able to maintain the positive effects while reducing side effects,” says Júlia Teixidor-Deulofeu, first author of the study and PhD student at Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The effect in the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The identified nerve cells are located in an area of the brain called the dorsal vagal complex. For the researchers, the result is not only an early step toward potentially improved treatment, it also provides new knowledge about how semaglutide works in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also provides deeper insight into how the brain stem regulates our energy balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Semaglutide and other GLP-1R agonists are currently being prescribed to more and more people and are also being investigated for other potential indications such as substance use disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is important to understand how these drugs actually work. The better we understand this, the greater the opportunity we have to improve them,” says Linda Engström Ruud, researcher and supervisor to PhD students Júlia Teixidor-Deulofeu and Sebastian Blid Sköldheden, who both worked on the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this semaglutide and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Júlia Teixidor-Deulofeu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Gothenburg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Júlia Teixidor-Deulofeu – University of Gothenburg&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2025.04.018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Semaglutide effects on energy balance are mediated by &lt;em&gt;Adcyap1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in the dorsal vagal complex&lt;/a&gt;” by Júlia Teixidor-Deulofeu et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semaglutide effects on energy balance are mediated by &lt;em&gt;Adcyap1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in the dorsal vagal complex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of the GLP-1R agonist semaglutide is revolutionizing the treatment of obesity, yet its mechanistic effects on energy balance remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we demonstrate that reactivation of semaglutide-responsive dorsal vagal complex neurons mimics the drug’s effects of reducing food intake and body weight and promoting fat utilization and conditioned taste aversion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observe that many of the semaglutide-activated area postrema (AP) and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) neurons express &lt;em&gt;Adcyap1&lt;/em&gt; mRNA, and ablation of AP/NTS &lt;em&gt;Adcyap1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons largely reverses semaglutide’s effects on energy balance acutely in lean mice and in subchronically treated obese mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide-activated AP/NTS &lt;em&gt;Adcyap1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons promote the loss of fat rather than lean mass, with only a modest effect on conditioned taste aversion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, NTS &lt;em&gt;Adcyap1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons are engaged by GLP-1R-expressing AP neurons and are necessary for semaglutide-induced activation of several downstream satiety-related structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selective targeting of semaglutide-responsive &lt;em&gt;Adcyap1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons holds potential for improved future anti-obesity treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A 35-year-old man says he transformed his body in a few months by switching to full-body workouts and smaller portion sizes with a protein goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Simon Doyle, a GP from London, had a consistent fitness routine until a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/shoulder-hurt-when-lifting-arm-pain-overhead-press-when-stop-2022-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;shoulder injury&lt;/a&gt; left him out of the gym for more than a year, during which he started to feel out of shape and struggled to bounce back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It happens gradually.

"I'm using my rest time to work different muscle groups."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="6eb18315-0f92-4e1f-beb4-2715d18bf442" data-toc-id="6eb18315-0f92-4e1f-beb4-2715d18bf442"&gt;Increasing weight is key for muscle gains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doyle said tracking his workouts boosted his progress by adding more weight to his lifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His typical session involved three sets per exercise and no more than 12 reps per set. If he hit all 12 reps, he would increase the weight to make it more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technique of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/progressive-overload-fitness-meaning-and-how-to-do-it-2021-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;progressive overload&lt;/a&gt;, gradually putting more stress on your muscles, is a well-established fitness technique. That's what prompts muscles to build back bigger and stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, Doyle said he would get stuck at a certain weight. Recently, Enaz helped him break through a plateau by increasing the weight on the first set, even if he couldn't lift heavier for all three, until he was able to adapt, Doyle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You really track that to make sure you're not plateauing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

Skipping preventive care.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://medicine.duke.edu/profile/heather-elizabeth-whitson" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Heather Whitson" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b4e63e4b0f527e57a765e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medicine.duke.edu/profile/heather-elizabeth-whitson" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Dr. Heather Whitson&lt;/a&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="https://agingcenter.duke.edu/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Duke Aging Center" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b4e63e4b0f527e57a765e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://agingcenter.duke.edu/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Duke Aging Center&lt;/a&gt; in North Carolina, neglecting to stay up to date on preventive care — including things like mammograms, colonoscopies and vaccines — is not good for your long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like not taking your car into the shop,” Whitson said. “It’s probably not going to last as long if you don’t keep up with the routine maintenance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can chat with your primary care doctor about what preventive tests are right for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Not cultivating social relationships.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that socialization helps with your brain and with your longevity,” said &lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1346279213/lee-a-lindquist-md-mph" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Lee Lindquist" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b4e63e4b0f527e57a765e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nm.org/doctors/1346279213/lee-a-lindquist-md-mph" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Lee Lindquist&lt;/a&gt;, chief of geriatrics at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. The more time you spend interacting with other people, the more it can benefit your life span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always joke... that you need to socialize with happy people, because we all have toxic people in our lives,” she said.

As you age, it’s normal for your social circle to dwindle, which means it’s critical to keep going out to meet new people if you want to age well, Lindquist noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Not adjusting your medications as you age.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We see it so many times where people will be on medicines that they were started on in their 40s and 50s that they may not need in their 70s or 80s,” Lindquist said. “And some of these medicines are not ideal for older adults.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain medications can make you more susceptible to falls and cause thinking problems, she added.

Not exercising.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one probably isn’t surprising, but it can’t be said enough: Failing to exercise will harm your longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise is amazing — being able to put exercise in a pill form would take a lot of health care providers out of business, because it really is good for mood, it’s good for weight control, it’s good for your bones, it’s good for your heart, it’s good for your brain,” Whitson said. “And it really is about the only thing that you can recommend that has all-around good benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercising is super important, and not exercising or not getting enough daily activity is something that will definitely harm your longevity,” Lindquist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked how much she recommends people exercise, Lindquist simply said: “More.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you get too comfortable, and doing the same activity three times a week, once a week, or even not at all, it just really hurts your body,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you’re someone who goes on a daily walk, try adding in a Zumba class a few times a week. If you’re a die-hard Peloton fan, sign up for some personal training classes, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if you ask your physician for a physical therapy order to get you started to get you moving around more, that’s very important,” Lindquist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a benchmark to start, you should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise each week, according &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="to the American Heart Association" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b4e63e4b0f527e57a765e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;to the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;. And, again, more minutes mean more health benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Smoking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/effects_cig_smoking/index.htm" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Smoking cigarettes is linked" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b4e63e4b0f527e57a765e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/effects_cig_smoking/index.htm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;Smoking cigarettes is linked&lt;/a&gt; to lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, stroke and more. But it’s highly addictive, making it hard to just quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/quit-smoking/i-want-to-quit/how-to-quit-smoking" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="American Lung Association" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b4e63e4b0f527e57a765e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.lung.org/quit-smoking/i-want-to-quit/how-to-quit-smoking" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;American Lung Association&lt;/a&gt;, it can be helpful to zero in on the reason you’re quitting smoking, so you can use it as motivation through the tough parts of the process. You can also get resources from your doctor to help you quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Klaus Vedfelt via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Klaus Vedfelt via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Staying social has proven longevity benefits.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Eating an unhealthy diet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Whitson, prioritizing a healthy diet is another way to better your chances of a healthy life span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitson suggested that “a Mediterranean-style diet that is heavy on fish... and heavy on whole fruits and vegetables and grains, with only the very occasional treat of processed food, is probably the best thing for most people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s never too late to change your diet ― but you may have an easier time doing so when you’re younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very hard to change your diet when you’re in your 70s, 80s, 90s, so if you can start eating right earlier, it’s going to be easier for you and it’ll affect you better over the long run,” Lindquist explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Not getting enough sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of increasing evidence that depriving ourselves of sleep has long-term consequences,” Whitson said.

But certain conditions, like obstructive sleep apnea, put you at risk for some of these negative outcomes when left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re... noticing really excessive daytime sleepiness, if their partner’s telling them that they’re snoring or having apneic episodes [where you stop breathing] that are waking them up at night,” it’s important to let a doctor know, Whitson noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults need &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/better-sleep-avoid-habits_l_62bef6dfe4b065b10ad3bed0" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="seven to nine hours of sleep each night" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682b4e63e4b0f527e57a765e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="62bef6dfe4b065b10ad3bed0" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="16"&gt;seven to nine hours of sleep each night&lt;/a&gt;.

Letting stress go unmanaged.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really hard to not feel stressed about work and family and whatever other things make us stressed out, but just be mindful that we as humans have a very physical stress response to things that are not a physical threat to us,” Whitson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many animals have a stress response that kicks in under conditions of urgency, like when they’re being chased by a predator or looking for water. Generally, once the need is met, the stress goes away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We as humans are able to stress about things that... just don’t pose any physical threat to us ― but then by turning on that stress response and having it kind of chronically activated, it does all kinds of things,” Whitson said. “It reduces our immune system’s ability to fight off real pathogens and things that are our real stressors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress also takes a toll on our metabolism, our sleep, our blood pressure and more. It’s important to do what you can to decrease your stress, whether that’s talking to a mental health professional (if possible) or cutting out things in life that cause you problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Not planning for your future health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We talk a lot about planning for end of life — you know, what are you going to do? Do you want CPR? Do you want advanced-care planning? Who’s my power of attorney? Where’s my will?” Lindquist said. “But many times people don’t think about, ‘What am I going to do in the 10 to 20 years before I die?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lindquist refers to this time frame as the “fourth quarter of life, because that’s the time when you’re going to have more health problems.” She added that people in their 70s, 80s and 90s are more likely to require hospitalization and deal with worsening memory loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides deciding who get the lake house, your golf clubs or your engagement ring, you should start thinking about your plan for the last 10 to 20 years of your life, Lindquist explained. Are you going to plan to move in with family? Will you have in-home care? Will you move to a senior community? Do you live near a hospital?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are conversations that people should be having, especially when they’re considering longevity and living longer,” she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;By having these conversations with loved ones, you can make sure your voice is heard as you age and that there are no unchecked expectations.

[but] they should know that they have to plan for it financially,” said Whitson. “One of the saddest things that I see as a geriatrician is when increasingly, it happens frequently now, that people outlive their savings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of Whitson’s patients in their 90s tell her they never expected to live so long, and that they didn’t expect to have to support themselves for another 30 years after retirement. “That happens, and it’s real,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I worry about some of the people that I see at midlife that are sort of expecting to retire at 65 and haven’t really accounted for the fact that if they live 30 healthy years after that, they better be able to know where their money is going to come from,” Whitson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="19"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

This doesn’t tell the whole story. When women do get a diagnosis, they’re often older and have a higher body fat mass. They’re also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6391911/"&gt;more likely to die&lt;/a&gt; from diabetes-related causes, especially heart disease. And some researchers think underdiagnosis might explain part of the gap—perhaps more cases are being missed in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;To address this disparity, researchers are trying to understand more about the biological and social differences that contribute to later diagnoses and worse outcomes in women, with some suggesting it’s time health care providers change the way they test for diabetes in order to catch at-risk women earlier, when treatments and lifestyle changes can have more impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;There are several potential reasons behind the differences in diagnosis for men and women. While many risk factors for type 2 diabetes are universal, they tend to show up later in women. The disease may also present differently in women, which could lead current diagnostic tools to overlook them. Using some tests but not others is a “major reason for underdiagnosis of diabetes in women,” says Michael Leutner, a professor in endocrinology and metabolism and a member of the Gender Medicine Unit at the Medical University of Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;We know there are biological differences between the sexes that affect type 2 diabetes—particularly the impact of hormones. Major hormonal shifts throughout a person’s lifetime can influence how their bodies manage blood sugar, with life events such as pregnancy and menopause affecting how type 2 diabetes develops and progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Gestational diabetes during pregnancy “is one of the most powerful harbingers of things to come,” says Judith Regensteiner, a professor of medicine and director of the Ludeman Family Center for Women’s Health Research at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. In fact, a gestational diabetes diagnosis is the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41572-019-0098-8"&gt;single biggest risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for type 2 diabetes in women, with some studies suggesting women who experience gestational diabetes are up to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108625"&gt;eight times&lt;/a&gt; more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Other hormonal shifts over a woman’s lifetime can influence type 2 diabetes risk and progression. How and where fat is stored in the body, for instance, is a key risk factor for type 2 diabetes in everybody, but not all fat is created equal. At younger ages, men are more likely than women to store visceral fat. “That’s the deep belly fat that sits deep around the organs,” explains Peter Goulden, associate professor at the Icahn School of Medicine and chief of the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolic Bone Disease at Mount Sinai in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Visceral fat is particularly harmful because it releases free fatty acids which increase resistance to insulin—the hormone which regulates blood sugar. Insulin “is the key that unlocks the cells, so the glucose can go into the cells,” Goulden says. With insulin resistance, the body’s cells stop responding to insulin as effectively, and glucose builds up in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOOVY2SDV4Z3V1a3NJOHlJMFJyRFlMSGtzYW9JajVFNS03ZHJvUmVSd1dvRjBfQmdKdWF0OXdzTGNVbU1QR3RESzFEZ25lN0YtYkhqeHk2anItMm01VDh6a0JUNkpaYW1WMUEwMlctVm5LejZMeWswUGlhamFjdm11eS1YRnc1ZTItUkIzbVFqSFlXdw</guid></item><item><title>是的，出于各种原因，您应该直起身来- MSN | Yes, You Should Stand Up Straight—for All Sorts of Reasons - MSN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxOTTYydkNfeVZ2ZFgyMzZDWHhzbVVFMXBsNHNJU0pJb3Vidnhya3l0NGNmcks2bTZSMFNmb2lLcTRnMEF0ZHdqaGdJVHVVVzBxRmR4MWJlekhzLVk3emN4anU4b3lGYzZIU195WVlNMUdESXlfOGFFZ05DaGx2MTBYcEFLLUVNS3NaTWxMaWdJcGxOTkZhTmdMS1VpQlhjSGx4UXVpbE5pWi1JM3Rv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

The findings, published in &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209432"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, are based on data from over 30,000 participants in the United States and indicate that food processing itself may play an important role in brain health, beyond traditional measures of nutritional quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods make up the majority of calories consumed in the United States. These foods are often manufactured with ingredients not typically used in home cooking—such as emulsifiers, artificial flavors, and stabilizers—and are designed to be hyper-palatable and convenient. Examples include packaged snacks, sweetened beverages, processed meats, and ready-to-eat meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research has linked high intake of these foods to metabolic and cardiovascular problems like obesity, hypertension, and heart disease. Some studies have also suggested connections to poorer brain health, but it remained unclear whether these links were simply due to poor overall diet quality or whether the processing itself might be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this question, researchers analyzed whether ultra-processed food consumption predicted risk of stroke or cognitive decline independently of adherence to three well-established healthy eating patterns: the Mediterranean diet, the DASH diet, and the MIND diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My research group has been interested in studying risk factors for stroke and cognitive impairment, including biomarkers that can be measured years in advance and predict subsequent neurologic disease,” said study author &lt;a href="https://kimberlylab.massgeneral.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;W. Taylor Kimberly&lt;/a&gt;, chief of the Division of Neurocritical Care at Mass General Hospital and an associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As part of that work, we identified new biomarkers of stroke, but the markers were independent of the usual risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, and high cholesterol. That got us thinking about what these markers might be a reflection of. As we considered a variety of potential factors, we found that diet was by far the strongest. As we studied the role of diet and brain health in more detail, we then recognized that the degree of food processing was an independent predictor of stroke and cognitive impairment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was part of &lt;a href="https://www.uab.edu/soph/regardsstudy/"&gt;the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) project&lt;/a&gt;, a long-term observational study designed to investigate why stroke rates are higher in some parts of the United States. It includes a diverse sample of Black and White adults aged 45 and older who were enrolled between 2003 and 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants provided detailed dietary information using a standardized food frequency questionnaire. Foods were categorized using the NOVA classification system, which groups items by level of processing. The researchers focused on NOVA1 (unprocessed or minimally processed foods) and NOVA4 (ultra-processed foods), analyzing their intake as a percentage of total daily food weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate groups were followed over time for the development of cognitive impairment or stroke. The cognitive impairment cohort included 14,175 people who had no evidence of cognitive issues at the start of the study and who completed follow-up cognitive testing. The stroke cohort included 20,243 participants without a prior history of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team used statistical models that accounted for a wide range of variables—including age, sex, race, income, education, blood pressure, diabetes, physical activity, depression, alcohol use, and more—to isolate the relationship between food processing and neurological outcomes. They also accounted for adherence to the Mediterranean, DASH, and MIND diets to see whether the level of food processing added predictive value beyond traditional dietary patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who consumed more ultra-processed foods had higher rates of both stroke and cognitive impairment during the study period. For every 10% increase in the proportion of ultra-processed food in the diet (by weight), there was a 16% higher risk of cognitive impairment and an 8% higher risk of stroke, even after controlling for other health and lifestyle factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, a higher proportion of unprocessed or minimally processed foods was associated with lower risk: a 12% reduction in stroke risk and a similar reduction in the likelihood of cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even relatively small differences in the consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) were associated with a differing risk to one’s brain health,” Kimberly told PsyPost. “In other words, swapping one or two meals each week from a UPF meal into less processed foods can have a substantive change in risk of stroke and cognitive impairment. This is encouraging because these types of changes sound achievable, and that it could modify one’s brain health in the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these associations were not explained away by the participants’ overall adherence to healthy diets. Even among people who followed the Mediterranean, DASH, or MIND diets, eating more ultra-processed foods was still linked to poorer outcomes. Adding ultra-processed food intake to models that already included these diet scores significantly improved the ability to predict who would go on to experience stroke or cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that the negative impact of ultra-processed foods on stroke risk was greater for Black participants than for White participants, though no such racial difference was observed for cognitive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prior studies had shown that diet patterns are important for maintaining good brain health (e.g., eating fruits, vegetables, whole grains, etc),” Kimberly explained. “Our study adds to that knowledge by reporting that the degree of food processing is also important. It’s not just what type of food you eat, but how it’s processed and prepared that also matters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could help refine public health recommendations and food policy. While the Mediterranean, DASH, and MIND diets remain effective strategies for supporting long-term brain health, the results suggest that reducing ultra-processed food intake may provide additional protection—even for those who already follow a healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study’s design is robust and includes a large, diverse sample with long-term follow-up, it does have limitations. Because it is observational, it cannot prove that ultra-processed foods cause cognitive decline or stroke. There may be unmeasured factors that explain the relationship. “While we can show there is a strong and consistent association between ultra-processed food intake and brain health, our study does not prove causation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, dietary intake was self-reported, which can introduce inaccuracies, and the classification of foods by processing level (using the NOVA system) has been criticized for being too broad or imprecise in some cases. The researchers also noted that results differed depending on whether they analyzed food intake by weight or by calories, highlighting the need for standardization in future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re now studying whether participants who had a change in their diet over the observation period also had a change in their risk of subsequent cognitive impairment,” Kimberly said. “Although this is not the same as running a randomized clinical trial, it builds further evidence to suggest that changing one’s diet is associated with a change in risk for subsequent brain health outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Long term, we hope to define which types of ultra-processed foods are associated with the greatest risk. Ultra-processed foods have some notable advantages—convenience, shelf life—and it’s likely that not all ultra-processed foods confer the same risk. The next step is to figure that out, which will allow policy makers to make informed decisions in the future about our food supply.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000209432"&gt;Associations Between Ultra-Processed Food Consumption and Adverse Brain Health Outcomes&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Varun M.

Medical science and technology have advanced so much that we can diagnose many thousands of distinct conditions, and we can even take genetic tests that scour our DNA for signs of a disease that may not materialize for decades — offering us a peek into our own future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And with these advances, we are being diagnosed more and more. The number of people diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/01/the-number-of-people-with-chronic-conditions-is-soaring-are-we-less-healthy-than-we-used-to-be-or-overdiagnosing-illness"&gt;chronic health conditions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/news/mental-health-diagnoses-take-unprecedented-leap/#:~:text=Clinical%20relevance:%20Mental%20health%20diagnoses,health%20specialists%20have%20been%20raised."&gt;mental health disorders&lt;/a&gt; is at an all-time high — at least partly, most experts agree, because we have simply catalogued more diseases to catch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yet we are also increasingly &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/news-releases/annual-poll-adults-express-increasing-anxiousness"&gt;anxious&lt;/a&gt;, anxious about our health — even anxious that we’re too anxious about our health. Our ability now to understand our bodies and put a name on what’s wrong with them does not always provide comfort; instead, it can create new fears and impose new constraints on us. Some health care leaders, including Donald Trump’s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/05/22/rfk-maha-commission-report-chronic-diseases/83768919007/"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; that we are becoming over-medicalized — too ready to take a pill for something, just for the sake of taking something. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The reality is nuanced because medicine is, to put it mildly, complicated. But we should in fact be careful about doling out diagnoses, says Dr. Suzanne O’Sullivan, an Irish neurologist and the author of a new book, &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/767687/the-age-of-diagnosis-by-dr-suzanne-osullivan/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Age of Diagnosis: How Our Obsession With Medical Labels Is Making Us Sicker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In her book, O’Sullivan argues that our eagerness to diagnose, preemptively screen, and otherwise push these new tools to their limits is creating problems that deserve to be taken more seriously. She describes mutually reinforcing trends — the patient’s insistence on certainty and the doctor’s desire to avoid being blamed for missing something — that are driving clinical practice toward overdiagnosis. The phenomenon is even leading to more instances of doctors diagnosing certain cancers &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6135119/"&gt;by 50 percent or more&lt;/a&gt;, due to the availability of new imaging tech that can detect even minuscule traces of abnormal cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Overdiagnosis can cause real harm. And so O’Sullivan advocates for “slow medicine,” in which doctors and patients take time to develop a relationship, monitor symptoms, and take a great deal of care before naming a condition — an approach that may sound quaint in an era of rapid-testing but something she says is actually more in tune with the reality that diagnosis is partly an art. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Most diagnoses come with a huge amount of uncertainty. That covers asthma, diabetes, cancer, autism. Diagnosis is a clinical skill,” she told me in a recent interview. “Now, the difficulty, I think, with modern medicine is a lot of people don’t understand that and that they feel that the test — the blood test or the brain scan — makes the diagnosis, when actually a diagnosis is made on understanding the &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt; in the context of the tests that are done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There is a tension here. Slowing down could, at least in theory, risk missing an aggressive disease early at the most crucial time — when it can still be treated. And in the United States, simply getting a doctor’s appointment &lt;a href="/policy/23753724/physician-doctor-shortage-primary-care-medicare-medicaid-rural-health-care-access"&gt;can be more challenging than it should be&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Each individual case is unique, O’Sullivan acknowledges, which is why a relationship with your own primary care doctor is so important. But she argues that, on the whole, doctors have erred too far in the other direction, toward diagnosing conditions too quickly and too confidently and creating a different set of problems for patients. During our conversation, we spoke about how to balance our tremendous new technological abilities with a more measured approach to clinical practice and how she would respond to critics who argue her advice would lead to people’s health problems being missed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, let’s clarify something basic. What do you mean by overdiagnosis? How do you define it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I think of overdiagnosis as measuring the point at which a medical diagnosis ceases to be useful. A diagnosis may be right or it may be wrong, but it isn’t always beneficial in a certain situation. Overdiagnosis is trying to ask when a diagnosis is genuinely a useful way of conceptualizing someone’s difficulties, and when it is not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first chapter is about Huntington’s disease. Why did you start there? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s a genetic test available for Huntington’s disease. If you happen to have the gene for Huntington’s disease, you are destined to get Huntington’s if you live long enough. If you have the genetic test, you can find out ahead of time that you have that at some point in your future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I needed people to understand the power of a diagnosis to make you sick even when you actually don’t have much physically wrong with you. I tell the story of a patient named Valentina, who didn’t have the gene but believed that she did because of her family history. Because of her strong belief that she had the gene, she developed all the symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When we take on a medical label, when we are told that we are sick in some way, we inadvertently search ourselves for the symptoms and signs of the label that we’ve been given. Our bodies are very noisy engines. There’s all sorts of things to notice if you are given reason to notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The Huntington’s disease community is in this incredible situation where they have the opportunity to find out they have a diagnosis 20 years before the disease starts. And in most countries, only 10 percent to 20 percent of people actually have the genetic test that will advise them of the disease. They do that because they are a community who has given a great deal of thought to what it’s like to live with the label of an impending disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Once you discover you have a positive test, it completely changes your relationship with your body. It changes how you think about your health. And once you know, you can’t &lt;em&gt;unknow&lt;/em&gt;. I spoke to loads of people with Huntington’s, and they all said the same thing: that living with the hope that you are negative and that everything is okay is a way better life than living with the knowledge that you’re positive and waiting for the disease to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the most interesting themes in the book is this idea that people want and have come to expect concrete answers from modern medicine. Black or white: You have a disease or you don’t. But you cover chronic Lyme disease, long COVID, and autism, these conditions where the boundaries are fuzzier. What problems does that create? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Most diagnoses come with a huge amount of uncertainty. That covers asthma, diabetes, cancer, autism. Diagnosis is a clinical skill. It requires a good clinician to be able to put the patient’s story in the context of tests and findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Now, the difficulty, I think, with modern medicine is a lot of people don’t understand that and that they feel that the test makes the diagnosis, the blood test or the brain scan, when actually a diagnosis is made on understanding the story in the context of the tests that are done. That means that diagnosis is hugely subjective. I hear a lot of stories of people going to different doctors who said I didn’t have a diagnosis, but then the 11th doctor said I did have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There is an inherent subjectivity that doctors will manage differently. I’m a doctor in a highly specialized center, and I deliberately err on the side of slight underdiagnosis. I do that because I’m aware that when I make a diagnosis of a brain disease, I am changing that person’s future forever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I’m not just changing their relationship with their body. I’m also changing their mortgage payments, their insurance, their confidence in themselves, their ability to get health insurance. I’m changing their finances, their practical future. I’m changing their ability to drive. There’s so many things that come with the diagnosis that people don’t think about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What many, many doctors do is they err on the side of overdiagnosis because that[‘s an easier place for a doctor to be. Because you’re never going to come back to me and say, “Listen, I don’t really believe I had asthma when I was a child.” You’ll say, “Well, listen, I had it. You treated it and now I’m better.” It protects us against someone coming back and saying we missed something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I came into this book thinking that something like cancer would very much be more of a yes or no. You either have it or you don’t. And if you do, you really would want to know about it — as soon as possible. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And yet, after reading your book, I felt like you had complicated that story. How do we risk overdiagnosing cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Within the medical community, this has been well-known for a long time, but it just doesn’t leak into the general conversation. The bottom line is if you screen healthy people for an illness, any illness, be it cancer or high blood pressure, diabetes, then you will be picking up borderline cases and overtreating them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the case of cancer, I try to remind people we’ve only had MRI scans in regular clinical use in doctors’ offices since the 1990s. They’ve only been as good as they are now in the last 10 years, as sensitive at picking up things. As we get these newer tests, we’re finally seeing inside the healthy body of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What we find when we screen people for things like cancer is we find abnormal cells. But not all abnormal cells go into cancer. Lots of people live out their lives having these abnormal cells. They never spread. They never do anything. They never grow. They would never threaten health. But our difficulty as doctors is because we’re so new to finding all these irregular abnormalities that when we find them, we don’t know which ones will turn into malignant cancers and which ones won’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So what we do is we treat them all as if they will inevitably turn into malignant cancers. One Cochrane Review &lt;a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD001877/BREASTCA_screening-for-breast-cancer-with-mammography"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that if you screen 2,000 women for breast cancer, you will save one woman’s life from breast cancer and treat 10 women for breast cancer who never needed to be treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I think sometimes we’re very in love with all of our access to screening tests and scans and health checks. A lot of that care is not only unnecessary, but actually doing us harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD001877/BREASTCA_screening-for-breast-cancer-with-mammography"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that if you screen 2,000 women for breast cancer, you will save one woman’s life from breast cancer and treat 10 women for breast cancer who never needed to be treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obviously being able to better more precisely diagnose conditions and to test samples at a genetic level represents advancement in science and an improvement in our understanding of our own body. How do we encourage that kind of development while mitigating the problems that you’re writing about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I work with people who’ve got rare brain diseases. The advancement in genetics and the ability to diagnose rare genetic conditions is amazing. I don’t want to in any way detract from what a phenomenal kind of medical advancement that is. I have no doubt that going forward in 20, 30, 40 years, it will continue contributing to science and to medicine in very positive ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="how-to-talk-to-your-doctor-about-slow-medicine" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to talk to your doctor about “slow” medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;O’Sullivan’s book is not a self-help guide, but after reading it, it’s easy to come up with some strategies that could help each of us bring a “slow-medicine” sensibility to our next doctor’s appointment and potentially avoid overdiagnosis. Such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Set expectations with your doctor. Make clear that you don’t want to be quick to judgment or treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Press your doctor to get a better sense of how confident they are in a diagnosis, what could change their mind, what additional steps could be taken to double-check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;• If you’re really worried about something, speak up. Slow medicine means being thoughtful — not ignoring what your body is telling you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But something being modern and expensive and cutting-edge doesn’t mean it’s always better medicine. We need to be a little bit more open with the general public about the uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We’ll never understand the meaning of different genes to healthy populations if we don’t test them, so we need to do the population-based testing. But we need to be careful before we begin offering genetic tests to unsuspecting members of the public who probably think we understand them a great deal better than we do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We’re really on a learning curve at the moment. A little bit more clarity and honesty with the public would go a long way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would you respond to somebody who hears we should be testing less and diagnosing less and immediately thinks, “Well, you’re just going to put my health at risk.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Listen, I don’t want a diagnosis missed in myself. I don’t want to be the doctor who misses things either. So I completely understand people’s fear of dialing back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s not about replacing all these tests with nothing. It’s really advocating for this concept of slow, thoughtful medicine with good clinicians that we invest in good doctors, good nurses, good diagnosticians, and we don’t feel the need to be compelled to jump into tests and diagnosis at that first meeting. We have time to spend with our patients and meet them again to discuss the problem. That’s how you come to both a good understanding between patient and doctor. A quality diagnosis is made with time and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;I often find when I meet my patients for the first time, I don’t fully understand the story. I love to see how that story unfolds in subsequent meetings. So I’m not asking people to give up medical tests and labels and replace them with nothing. I’m asking that we improve our clinical skills and we meet people lots of times to improve the quality of diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxNU0pSLUdYSVFOcnVOTUdWOExyNlRNRjZMbkI5aE43ZnRSSkVaU0pwaFc2QTFuYU1EWWYtQnhYT3dMZF9kUWVPd0FzbUozVjBFVlA5dnBCcWRZUkVPcW9LUGdPN0FtTFc0QXpObkpvLWNka0RZWmsyLUZDR0RGbGhSLWFn</guid></item><item><title>专家发现男性和女性最有可能患皮肤癌的身体部位-不同之处在于-每日邮报 | Experts discover the parts of the body men and women are most likely to get skin cancer - the difference is st - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxPREhJNVVmUWN2bUFJb1lxa3ZQRG1UNlJRZkpxVGxNWjRra0FtZ2MtS3Y5U2xZWXRDNnJ5YUlJSXh4blZGQXhaR1ZiaG1kVmRpLXI3X0hOYllXa3pSRlNYTUJuSFNUakNvYjhQdWoybXRGSFVsaUJLS0FjdG03eWwyeFdnNVFVd0NMbnNQWHdodW1YdDDSAZgBQVVfeXFMT2dSTUdkMm0xYnZ6SUlna09uTHREaEZZaGlGRjRiejJKU0tTYjBnQnBoSDlDZFFfbEhGaXdFNFJMRjRKVS1jY3ZSV25UUGlOMXdTYUZsZHFBNnZ3U0tzOF8yaUhVczlzSDdMczNUZVl3bEhuSWhacldkWXdmdGMybTRHWkJtSFg4SFhsVVNDZVYwRHNFcUlUYnQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Parts of the body most likely to be susceptible to skin &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-403d5d20-3a0b-11f0-ae2f-6b05cf2bf7de"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; vary between men and women, new research has found, amid predictions that cases of the deadly disease will skyrocket this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to a study by &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/"&gt;Cancer Research UK&lt;/a&gt;, the majority of melanomas—a type of skin cancer that is usually caused by too much sun exposure—in men are found on the torso, including the back, chest and stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is the equivalent of around 3,700 cases a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Conversely, women most commonly develop the deadly lesions on the legs, from the hips to the ankles, accounting for 3,200 cases every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was the least common place for men to get melanoma, the research, based on data from 2018 to 2021, found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And only 22 per cent of women with the disease develop it on the torso—the second least common part of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, men were almost twice as likely as women to have been diagnosed with melanoma on their head or neck (24 per cent versus 13 per cent). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have suggested one reason behind this phenomenon is due to the different areas of the body men and women are likely to expose as the weather gets warmer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;New research has revealed that men are more likely to develop skin cancer on their torsos, while more than a third of melanomas in women are found on the legs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The charity suggested that the shapes of our bodies could also be to blame for the 'stark difference'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Men’s torsos are typically bigger than women’s, and women’s legs take up a larger proportion of their body surface area. Hair, which can differ based on style or genetics, might contribute too,' according to a report on the study published by the charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14716101/I-diagnosed-stage-4-cancer-strange-things-happened-skin-symptoms-you-ignore.html"&gt;Melanoma &lt;/a&gt;is the most dangerous type of skin cancer, accounting for four out of five deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fiona Osgun, head of health information at Cancer Research UK, warned: 'Getting sunburned just once every couple of years can triple your risk of melanoma skin cancer, compared with never being burned.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study found that an alarming 87 per cent of melanoma cases, the equivalent of  17,100 in the UK each year, are caused by overexposure to ultraviolet radiation, either directly from the sun or sun beds—meaning they could be avoided. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because increased UV exposure can damage the DNA in skin cells, triggering mutations that become cancerous. From here, the cancer can spread to the blood vessels beneath the skin, getting into the bloodstream and spreading throughout the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, rates of the cancer reached a record high in the UK, with new diagnoses increasing by almost a third in just a decade, according to Cancer Research UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, experts are warning that melanoma cases are on the rise again—with rates set to surge faster in men than women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Signs of skin cancer range from innocuous to obvious, but experts warn that treating cases early is key to making sure they do not spread or further develop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Michelle Mitchell, CEO at Cancer Research, said: 'The growing number of people diagnosed with melanoma is concerning, especially when we can see that rates are rising faster in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you notice anything different on your skin, like a new mole, a mole that's changed in size, shape, or colour, or any patch of skin that looks out of the ordinary—don't ignore it, speak to your GP', she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most melanomas—the rarest but most deadly form of skin cancer that is most likely to spread—present as moles that have uneven edges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When diagnosis melanoma, dermatologists look out for asymmetry, border, colour diameter and evolving, known as the ABCDEs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With warmer weather fast approaching, research suggests that 21,300 cases of the disease could be expected this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The UK has also seen a seven per cent rise in young people, aged 25-49, as experts urge people to contact their GP at the first warning sign of skin cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We want to beat skin cancer for everyone, no matter who they are or where they're from', Ms Mitchell explained, 'but, early diagnosis is key and could make all the difference.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The charity is now urging people to take simple steps to stay safe from UV rays—which can cause significant damage even when it's cloudy or cool. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Comedian Katherine Ryan, 41, revealed earlier this year that she is battling skin cancer for the second time having been diagnosed with Stage 2 cancer in 2004 (pictured on The Great Celebrity Bake Off for Stand Up To Cancer in 2021) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Try to stick to the safe between 11am and 3pm when the sun is strongest, wear clothes that help cover up your skin, with a hat and sunglasses, and use sunscreen with at least SPF30 and 4 or 5 stars', Ms Osgun advised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Peter Johnson, the national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, added: 'Prevention is by far the best plan with skin cancer, so avoid the sun when it is at its hottest and ensure you use sunscreen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For skin cancer, as for any cancer, it is vital that you are seen and diagnosed as early as possible, so people should come forward if they are concerned about symptoms', he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Getting checked saves lives'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently around 15,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with melanoma each year—the UK's fifth most common cancer—with the incidence rate rising faster than any other common cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;How the cancer is treated depends on whether the cancer has spread—with only 27 per cent of patients diagnosed at stage four surviving beyond five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surgery is the main treatment for the disease, especially if it is found early.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This comes as patients with the deadliest type of skin cancer are set to be given fast-tracked access to a revolutionary cancer vaccine on the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The needle-free injection is custom-built for patients to stop their melanoma returning—which experts believe will herald a new era in fighting the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It works by boosting the immune system's response, helping it to 'attack' proteins that are specific to melanoma tumours, preventing them from returning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, around half of patients diagnosed with melanoma respond to immunotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, those who don't are at a higher risk of their cancer getting worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Improvements in skin cancer survival rates highlight the remarkable progress driven by our research,' Ms Mitchell explained. 'But the growing number of people diagnosed with melanoma is still concerning.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At just 6 months old, KJ received a gene editing treatment custom-built to correct his unique mutation. He’s not cured, researchers explained at the annual American Society of Gene &amp;amp; Cell Therapy meeting in New Orleans. But he has been able to resume a normal diet and is no longer on the path to a liver transplant. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The news could not have come at a more welcome or more jarring time for the field. For three years, gene editing has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/06/crispr-gene-editing-medical-breakthrough-not-matched-by-financial-success/"&gt;seemed in free fall&lt;/a&gt;, riven by layoffs, closures, shuttered programs and sinking stock prices.  Now here, finally, in striped pajama form, was a reminder of what a decade of advances could deliver. “How awesome is it that we’re at this point?” said Nessan Bermingham, who co-founded and led Intellia, one of the first CRISPR companies, until 2017. &lt;/p&gt;

They know that vagus nerve activity, known as vagal tone, reduces heart rate, for instance, but they don't know which of the 200,000 fibers are behind that mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration approved a vagus nerve stimulation device, which is similar to a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/what-is-a-pacemaker" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;pacemaker&lt;/a&gt; and implanted into a patient's neck, to treat epilepsy in 1997 and depression in 2005. But it's also being studied as a therapy for several inflammatory conditions, including &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/work-remote-health-condition-return-to-office-policies-2024-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1998, Tracey and his team at the Feinstein Institute became the first to discover this link. When they stimulated the vagus nerves of mice with a handheld stimulator, it reduced their inflammation, measured via levels of inflammatory biomarkers, in their blood by 75%.&lt;/p&gt;

But the reality is, the science to prove that any of these hacks work just isn't there yet, Tracey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's probably a good thing. But can we say for certain we understand how it all works? No, not yet," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Tracey believes in his own data and that of his colleagues, so he does most of these things just in case they can help &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-the-atlantic-diet-health-benefits-study-2024-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;prevent chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt;.

He does this because cold exposure triggers the body's &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/mental-health/fight-flight-freeze-fawn" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;fight-or-flight response&lt;/a&gt;, which evidence suggests can suppress inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Studies suggest that after the initial shock of the cold, ramping up the heartbeat, the parasympathetic nervous system is then activated, slowing down your breathing and heart rate. This suggests the vagus nerve is activated by cold exposure, but any role it has in reducing inflammation is still unclear, Tracey wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="418c72ae-87fb-4544-bf9e-2012dc4a19c3" data-toc-id="418c72ae-87fb-4544-bf9e-2012dc4a19c3"&gt;2) Thirty minutes of daily exercise&lt;/h2&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tracey works out for 30 to 45 minutes about five times a week. He does a mixture of cardio, &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/strength-training-better-cardio-burning-fat-2023-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;weight and resistance training&lt;/a&gt;, stretching, and yoga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that exercise is good for you, but you may be surprised to learn that scientists don't fully understand the mechanisms behind the health benefits, Tracey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take running: We know that over time it reduces resting heart rate and increases heart variability (the time in between heartbeats), which indicates the heart is working efficiently. It's possible that this is a result of exercise increasing vagal tone, because it's responsible for slowing the heart down, but more research is needed to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether this turns out to be true or not, working out regularly is a no-brainer investment to make in your health. "Strength training preserves muscle mass, improves metabolic function, and prevents injuries. Aerobic exercise, such as walking, cycling, or swimming, enhances cardiovascular health and endurance," Tracey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="71cf1c45-c5fb-4581-9b53-1101ef6dc44c" data-toc-id="71cf1c45-c5fb-4581-9b53-1101ef6dc44c"&gt;3) Meditation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracey meditates for 10 minutes most mornings, often using apps such as &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meditation-apps-review-headspace-calm-one-was-way-better-2021-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early research suggests that meditating can reduce inflammation, but more is needed, Tracey said. A &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735822000095" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;2022 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; that reviewed 48 randomized controlled trials involving 4,638 people found that those who meditated had fewer inflammatory biomarkers in their blood compared with those in control groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's possible that meditation could increase vagus nerve activity, which in turn reduces inflammation, Tracey said, but we lack direct proof. Regardless, he has found that regular meditation has enabled him to be more present and less reactive to things he can't control.&lt;/p&gt;

Of those, 268 couples who’d been married in the past six months and were living together were recruited into the study. One spouse was a healthy control, while the other had insomnia with anxiety and depression. On day one and day 180 of the study, all participants had their oral microbiome composition and salivary cortisol (stress hormone) levels taken. Participants were asked not to change their baseline dietary habits, oral hygiene practices, or exercise routines during the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that after six months of marriage to a partner with insomnia with features of depression and anxiety, healthy spouses showed increased depression and anxiety scores, and poorer sleep quality. The changes were more pronounced in female spouses. While salivary cortisol levels were significantly higher in insomniac spouses, they found that healthy spouses also experienced elevated cortisol levels after six months, indicating stress-related physiological changes. Interestingly, the researchers observed that the composition of the bacteria found in the mouths of healthy spouses changed considerably, becoming increasingly similar to their affected partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oral microbiota transfer between individuals in close contact, such as couples in the present study, may mediate depression and anxiety,” said the researchers. “We found that changes in oral microbiota composition are associated with changes in the severity of insomnia, salivary cortisol levels, and depression and anxiety scores. Our findings align with previous studies on salivary cortisol levels as well as depression and anxiety scores.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers said that oral microbiome transfer between couples makes sense, given that other forms of physiological synchrony have been documented, including &lt;a class="Link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33355941/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;synchronized heartbeats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="Link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25581920/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;sleep concordance&lt;/a&gt;. They said their findings have implications for holistic, personalized and preventive medicine, especially in the context of mental health treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some limitations of the study include the use of self-reporting to measure insomnia, depression, and anxiety; the measurement of only morning salivary cortisol levels; and the researchers' failure to control for shared lifestyle factors such as diet. Additionally, due to financial restraints, bacterial samples were only collected from the tonsils and pharynx, rather than the full oral microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the study raises some interesting questions for future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since this study is associational, further research is needed to establish whether this association is causal,” the researchers said. “If it is determined that this association is indeed causal, it could have significant implications for contemporary research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the journal &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.xiahepublishing.com/2472-0712/ERHM-2025-00013" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Exploratory Research and Hypothesis in Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This can be assessed by a simple ultrasound examination of the liver when it is bigger and brighter than usual – that's a sure sign of fatty liver.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added, “Fatty liver disease, also known as hepatic steatosis, happens when your liver cells gather too much fat, and this fat interferes with the normal metabolic functions of the liver cells. There are two main types: one caused by drinking too much alcohol (AFLD) and the other not linked to alcohol but associated with obesity, diabetes, or metabolic dysfunction (NAFLD).”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

seemingly of a broken heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But to Gibbs’ father-in-law, the sudden wipeout of the entire Davis family was oddly suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Something sinister was going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toppan, the popular Boston nurse and Davis family friend who had cared for each of the four victims, was harboring a macabre secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Jolly' Jane Toppan was one of America's first and most prolific female serial killers, murdering at least 31 victims &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As a nurse, Toppan (pictured) killed patients and anyone else who got in her way with lethal doses of morphine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For years, Toppan was known by the affectionate nickname ‘Jolly’ Jane due to her warm and jovial bedside manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, in reality, she was &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/news/article-11745697/Female-serial-killers-nurses-healthcare-professionals-kill-children-elderly.html"&gt;an ‘Angel of Death’&lt;/a&gt; - killing patients and anyone else who got in her way with lethal doses of morphine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some were injected with a fatal dose of the drug while others were poisoned with Toppan’s special laced bottles of Hunyadi mineral water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a sick twist, Toppan reveled in toying with her victims' lives by bringing them to and from the brink of death with alternating doses of morphine and atropine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As her helpless victims lay dying, the ‘jolly’ nurse would curl up in bed with them - getting a twisted sexual thrill while they gave their last breaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time ‘Jolly’ Jane Toppan was exposed as one of America’s first female serial killers, she had claimed the lives of at least 31 victims, according to her own remorseless confession letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But many fear the number could truly top 100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘She really was probably the first woman serial killer,’ Diane Ranney, the former assistant director of the Jonathan Bourne Public Library in Massachusetts who has researched the Toppan case for decades, tells DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘[But] it seems odd to me that the fame really never reached her.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jane Toppan's shocking confession letter was released in the New York Journal in 1902 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite her sadistic murder spree, Toppan is a serial killer that few have heard of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even in the Cape Cod town of Bourne - where many of the murders took place - Ranney says the chilling past is a little known tale among the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘People don't know about it… for some reason, it's one of those well-hidden secrets,’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Born Honora Kelly in Boston’s south end in 1854 to Irish immigrant parents, Toppan’s start in life was turbulent to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her mom died when she was only a small child, leaving her and her sister to be raised by her alcoholic father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Some victims were poisoned with laced bottles of Hunyadi mineral water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a bizarre twist, her dad - in the throes of mental health issues - sewed his own eyelids shut and abandoned his two daughters at the Boston Female Asylum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Honora was later taken in as an indentured servant by the wealthy Toppan family and her name changed to Jane Toppan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I'm probably the only person who's been researching her who feels sorry for her,’ Ranney says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Everyone else calls her a monster, which in a way she was, but the more I looked into things, the more I thought, she's a very interesting person.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Through her years of research, Ranney says it’s ‘a question of why she was like she was’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s a question Toppan gave a curious answer for after she was caught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In her young adulthood, Toppan was jilted at the altar by her fiancé.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She went on to blame her lover - and being unmarried - for sending her down her dark and deadly path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If I had been a married woman I probably would not have killed all these people,’ she infamously claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rejected by her lover, Toppan decided to train at Cambridge Hospital to be a nurse - a vocation that would give her the knowledge of drugs and position of trust that she would later exploit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A courtroom sketch of the trial of the 'Angel of Death' Jane Toppan in the Boston Post in 1902&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Toppan started working as a nurse, she became an instant hit, earning her the nickname Jolly Jane as she would always joke with her patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘She had a rather strange way of expressing her love for her patients. She took very, very good care of them… But in the end, she wound up killing them,’ Ranney says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is unclear exactly when the killing spree started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During her time at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Cambridge School of Nursing, many patients mysteriously died in her care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she then turned to private nursing, providing her rich patients with home visits, there were also curious spates of fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But surprisingly, the deaths were always explained away by some illness or another - and no alarm was raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several years would pass before anyone suspected the nurse of killing the patients she had doted on with such care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For other victims, Toppan’s murders were far more personal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There was her foster sister Elizabeth Brigham who she had grown up with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Toppan also murdered her foster sister Elizabeth Brigham (pictured) who she had grown up with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her best friend Sarah Connors whose job she wanted to take at a theology school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her love interest’s sister Edna Bannister who she felt was getting in the way of a romance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And her former landlords Israel and Lovey Dunham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toppan’s luck only ran out when she murdered the Davis family in summer 1901 after they had dared to ask her to finally pay the $500 in overdue rent she owed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even Toppan went on to admit this may have finally been a step too far, declaring: ‘That was the greatest mistake of my life.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following pressure from Gibbs’ father-in-law, her body was exhumed and a fatal dose of morphine discovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toppan’s depraved killing spree was a secret no more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In October 1901, the 47-year-old was arrested for murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultimately, she only stood trial for the murder of Gibbs in a case that hit headlines across the US as the media and public poured over the story of a perverse female serial killer who got a sexual kick out of killing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Victims who lived to tell the tale came forward with their shocking stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One patient described Toppan plying her with a mystery drink and then clambering on top of her, kissing and caressing her while she lay suffering in a hospital bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jane Toppan was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was sent to the Massachusetts psychiatric hospital in Taunton (pictured) where she lived until her death in 1938&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the woman passed the bizarre encounter off as a dream - only learning how close she came to being another victim when Toppan was arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While suspected of 11 murders, a bombshell confession letter published in the New York Journal revealed Toppan’s actual death toll was at least 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the shocking declaration, Toppan boasted that her depraved goal was ‘to have killed more people - helpless people - than any other man or woman who lived’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also described being driven by an ‘uncontrollable passion’ for death, writing that: ‘No voice has as much melody in it as the one crying for life; no eyes as bright as those about to become fixed and glassy; no face so beautiful as the one pulseless and cold.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ranney says there is no indication that Toppan deliberately chose a career in nursing to give her the opportunity to kill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I don't think it started out like that. I think she may have accidentally killed someone without realizing… she may have just decided, “oh, look what I can do. Wow, that really gave me a thrill.” But I don't think she became a nurse for that reason,’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I think part of it was a sense that she was powerful.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A courtroom sketch of the trial of Jane Toppan in the Boston Daily Globe on November 1, 1901&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Toppan (pictured) would climb into bed with her victims and get a sexual thrill from the moment they died &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than a century on, however, questions remain as to whether it was really Toppan who penned the shocking confession letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ranney isn’t so sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I've always wondered whether it really was [her],’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It did not strike me that it was her writing… just the way it's written. I don't think she would have been quite so blunt about things. It just seems to me that her nature was to be more secretive.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adds: ‘But then again, by that time, she may have decided that she was just going to confess because it brought her more notoriety.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toppan was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was sent to the Massachusetts psychiatric hospital in Taunton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She lived there until her death in 1938.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Somewhat ironically, Toppan would often refuse to eat and drink at the facility - paranoid that someone was trying to poison her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 03:57:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxOX0dyOWVzc2hBTGhJWFNGQUtpN24yUnoxNldNbVk2aWVVek85aTdjWUJoR1hlN1F6Yk9Xbl9CXzhwckFaQnFGZzBCd0wyUmxfamd0cG1yc3dQdURIQ3RudWFxREQxOS12Z3Y0THdGS0dtRXdpcUVESkVZLXZOZW52OXJuNkQzSGtpSDBPeTBXT0tncWpuejNZNEhwdw</guid></item><item><title>男人欺骗未婚妻，同时恳求一个家庭，她的公共报复让他争先恐后-无聊的熊猫 | Man Cheats On Fiancée While Pleading For A Family, Her Public Revenge Leaves Him Scrambling - Bored Panda</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE42elBFZWtpOFdHeWgyaWhZRVRGOEV0WTdSM3ZRN25YNDg1YldwTnA0RjdGU052TlY0ZHpkMi1rRWZ3YlJqR2c5S0xVVUVZb3hFRUZTeXBCMXN4TEFMRHQ4OWxUYkxDUWdCWi1BOGJB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When you care about someone, it’s easy to give them second chances.

anyone would stay with someone who treats them poorly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for people inside the relationship, the answer isn’t so simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, according to a YouGov &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3330752/Stiff-upper-lip-gone-far-60-stay-bad-relationships-poor-customer-service-save-face.html" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 60% of people admitted to staying in unfulfilling relationships, many of them despite being lied to, dismissed, or even cheated on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why do we stay, even when we know we shouldn’t? Clinical psychologist &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mindful-dating/202404/10-reasons-you-cant-move-on-from-an-unhealthy-relationship" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Dr. Roxy Zarrabi&lt;/a&gt; offers 10 reasons that help explain what makes walking away so difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. You get hooked on the highs and lows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toxic relationships often swing between good moments and really painful ones. Those rare highs, when things feel exciting or passionate, can become addictive, making the lows easier to ignore. Over time, this emotional rollercoaster can start to feel normal, even when it’s doing real damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. It reopens old wounds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, what keeps you stuck isn’t just the relationship, it’s what the relationship brings up. If your current partner triggers unhealed pain from past heartbreak or childhood, it might feel like you’re trying to “fix” something by staying, even when it’s unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Your self-worth takes a hit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toxic partners often erode your confidence slowly over time. If someone constantly judges or belittles you, it’s easy to start doubting your own value. Leaving means facing all those feelings, and that can feel harder than staying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge-88" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge/?image_id=transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge-88.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Man Cheats On Fiancée While Pleading For A Family, Her Public Revenge Leaves Him Scrambling" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge/?media_id=transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge-88" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge-88.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8751285" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge-88.jpg" alt="Man Cheats On Fiancée While Pleading For A Family, Her Public Revenge Leaves Him Scrambling" title="Man Cheats On Fiancée While Pleading For A Family, Her Public Revenge Leaves Him Scrambling" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/back-view-of-young-man-embracing-his-wife-and-sitting-in-bed-room-comforting-encouraging-and-understanding-kiqCVo7300M" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Getty Images/Unsplash (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. You blame yourself for everything&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were made to feel like everything was your fault, guilt might keep you stuck. You start wondering if you could’ve done more, said less, or tried harder. That lingering “what if” can make it tough to fully let go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. You’re holding onto a fantasy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to replay the good moments and block out the bad. But idealizing what the relationship used to be, or what you hoped it would become, makes it harder to accept that it’s time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. You’ve become isolated from others&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toxic relationships often pull you away from friends or family, especially if your partner discouraged those connections. Without a strong support system, leaving can feel incredibly lonely and even more overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. You’ve lost touch with yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re constantly putting someone else’s needs first, you start losing sight of your own. After the relationship ends, it can feel like you don’t even know who you are anymore, and that fear of rediscovery can keep you stuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. The unknown feels scarier than the pain you know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaving means stepping into uncertainty. As hard as it is, some people choose the familiar pain over the scary unknown, because at least they know what to expect, even if it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge-89" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge/?image_id=transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge-89.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Man Cheats On Fiancée While Pleading For A Family, Her Public Revenge Leaves Him Scrambling" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge/?media_id=transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge-89" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge-89.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8751309" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge-89.jpg" alt="Man Cheats On Fiancée While Pleading For A Family, Her Public Revenge Leaves Him Scrambling" title="Man Cheats On Fiancée While Pleading For A Family, Her Public Revenge Leaves Him Scrambling" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/displeased-blonde-lady-sitting-on-bed-and-talking-with-husband-while-man-touching-his-chin-Wd-_mHaAOzI" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;Getty Images/Unsplash (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. You’re still keeping tabs on them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s texting “just to check in” or stalking their socials, staying connected can reopen emotional wounds. It keeps you in limbo, hoping they’ll change, even as they show you they won’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Your ability to trust has taken a hit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being hurt, it’s hard to trust anyone, including yourself. You start second-guessing your instincts and putting walls up, which makes healing and moving on feel even harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So before you judge someone for going back to a person who’s hurt them, or blame yourself for doing the same, try to approach it with compassion and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These moments are incredibly vulnerable, and support often plays a much bigger role than we realize. Reminding someone they’re not alone can be exactly what they need to find the courage to finally leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Readers backed her up, pointing out that the best part was walking away from the relationship for good&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge-14" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge/?image_id=transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge-14.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Man Cheats On Fiancée While Pleading For A Family, Her Public Revenge Leaves Him Scrambling" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge/?media_id=transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge-14" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge-14.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8739796" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge-14.jpg" alt="Woman transfers ex’s phone data, discovering cheating evidence, with comments about toxic relationships and personal growth." title="Woman transfers ex’s phone data, discovering cheating evidence, with comments about toxic relationships and personal growth." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge-13" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge/?image_id=transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge-13.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Man Cheats On Fiancée While Pleading For A Family, Her Public Revenge Leaves Him Scrambling" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge/?media_id=transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge-13" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge-13.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8739747" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/transferred-ex-phone-data-revenge-13.jpg" alt="Screenshot of an online comment sharing a personal story about healing after finding cheating evidence on an ex’s phone data." title="Screenshot of an online comment sharing a personal story about healing after finding cheating evidence on an ex’s phone data." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="postPoll-8737649" class="post-poll poll-wrapper single-post" data-poll-viewed="false" data-post-id="8737649" data-main-post-id="" data-poll-id="12470"&gt; &lt;input class="post-8737649-poll-value" type="hidden" value="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"&gt; &lt;div data-bind="if: isInitialised()"&gt;    &lt;div data-bind="if: !isLoading() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isShowingResults"&gt; &lt;div class="poll-content"&gt; &lt;h3 class="answered-content-title"&gt;Thanks!

I was 21 before I took my first airplane flight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;I’ve flown a lot more since then — including one business trip where I literally flew around the world on the same flight, only stopping occasionally at designated cities along the way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Now, teens and younger children fly by themselves and think nothing of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Air travel has become second nature for most of us and has burgeoned in recent years. For instance, in 1980, airlines flew 800 million passengers globally. In 2019, they flew a whooping 4.6 billion of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That’s a lot of people flying the friendly skies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Is it too many? Some people think so. Overtourism to popular tourist destinations like Rome, Paris and Tokyo makes it more likely you will meet other travelers than you will meet locals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;And what about the hassles of flying? Flight delays, airport security, crowded plans, and the like can all make travel challenging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;And what about all those time zone changes and interrupted sleep patterns? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Can that all be good for us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/09/240905121025.htm" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/09/240905121025.htm"&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; suggests the answer is “yes,” traveling may be an important way to slow down the aging process and revitalize our outlook. Researchers from Australia writing in Science Daily have concluded that by stimulating stress responses and elevating metabolic rates, traveling can positively influence the body’s natural self-organizing capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;These events and responses trigger an adaptive immune system response, they say. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/09/240905121025.htm" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/09/240905121025.htm"&gt;According to the researchers&lt;/a&gt;, “Put simply, the body’s self-defense system becomes more resilient. Hormones conducive to tissue repair and regeneration may be released and promote self-healing functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;So, beyond the mental health benefits of getting away and relaxing, travel actually triggers physical responses in our physical bodies that enable our immune system not only to kick in but also recharge. Despite the weariness that may sometimes come with travel, we get an extra boost from our hormones that help us resist ordinary diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Besides these scientific benefits, the many benefits of travel have long been noted by celebrities and ordinary people alike. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Centuries ago, Augustine wrote that “the world is like a book and those who do not travel read only one page. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the so-called Grand Tour — what today might be called a gap year — was the hallmark of education. Without firsthand observation of other places, a person’s education was considered incomplete. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="2400" data-height="1517"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/GNN5I4Z5AVFI5MGVWSR4C32KV4.jpeg?auth=de95e5df49a66328ce28843e63209946bca63be0c4009a8add13a08d0fb9a406&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=505" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/GNN5I4Z5AVFI5MGVWSR4C32KV4.jpeg?auth=de95e5df49a66328ce28843e63209946bca63be0c4009a8add13a08d0fb9a406&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1010 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Vehicles travel through Zion National Park. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Ravell Call, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;As Mark Twain wrote: Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow-mindedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Traveling can be the midwife of new outlooks, new perspectives — about ourselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Of course, the mindset we have when we travel likely affects both what we see and how much we enjoy it, writes Alain de Botton in his well-read book &lt;a href="https://www.alaindebotton.com/travel/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.alaindebotton.com/travel/"&gt;“The Art of Travel.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He emphasizes that when traveling we discover more when we learn about a place beforehand and limit our perceptions on how things “should” look or sound or smell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Each year, a few tourists are treated for what is called the Paris syndrome: extreme disappointment that the Eiffel Tower and other historic buildings are not bigger, classier, taller — like they appear in postcards. “A danger of travel is that we see things at the wrong time, before we have had a chance to build up the necessary receptivity,” du Botton writes, “so new information is therefore as useless and fugitive as necklace beads without a connecting chain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Travel gets me out of my comfort zone, Kris Garn Lewis says. “I not only see new places, but I also see myself in new ways. It’s not the same as reading about them. When I experience a new place, I have a visceral response to people sitting on a park bench, eating on a sidewalk café, or talking to their children. It’s more than seeing and hearing, it’s connecting on a unique personal level. It never ceases to amaze me that I am changed with each of these encounters in various ways large and small.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Columbia University professor Adam Galinsky agrees that international travel can have multiple benefits if we really engage with the local culture of the places we visit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/03/for-a-more-creative-brain-travel/388135/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/03/for-a-more-creative-brain-travel/388135/"&gt;Galinsky states&lt;/a&gt;, “Foreign experiences increase both cognitive flexibility and depth and integrativeness of thought.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Whoa, “intregativeness of thought”? Is integrativeness even a real word? Spell check on my computer says “no” but apparently it is used in academic circles when nothing else will quite do, like such words as combining or unifying or consolidating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Travelers, unlike tourists, are curious. They don’t just take photos, they ask questions about people, places and preferences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Larry Grossman, who has seen all of National Geographic’s &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/50_places_of_a_lifetime_1" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/50_places_of_a_lifetime_1"&gt;“50 Places of a Lifetime,”&lt;/a&gt; says travel is more than taking a journey, it is a way of living. “It’s like reading a really good book,” he says. “There’s unexpected twists and turns, character development, exciting action and some resolution at the end. Travel is the same.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But this can only happen if a traveler really engages with the local culture and environment. Interestingly, &lt;a href="https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/does-travel-broaden-mind-breadth-foreign-experiences-increases-generalized-trust" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/research/does-travel-broaden-mind-breadth-foreign-experiences-increases-generalized-trust"&gt;Galinsky also found&lt;/a&gt; that such travel increases our sense of trust not only of foreigners but also of people back home. It seems the more we learn to trust others in a foreign country the easier it is to trust neighbors in our own backyard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Now, there’s something we can all use: more trust among our neighbors, more willingness to see their peculiarities as part of the culture they experienced growing up. Maybe we don’t even have to leave home to experience the benefits of travel, maybe we can just be curious about others around us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It could make us more trusting, more curious, and create a new set of memories and postcards we can show our children and grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 03:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxQMW95YVY4Wm1ldlJMZzI2cnNXWHBydHZkRlEwVkFYNlROclZ3Z1lReWNrRmhJT2RqZFBLa0R2dFI3dWRpa2JxRGJabmFlRllOVEU5YmdGSURpU3ZUR1BtM29iM2hPbWdQcDJ2TmVBSnBxY0lBNjc0Q1R1dGE1SF9FTGlHOTFwQ21HUFh4NA</guid></item><item><title>科学支持的9个保持大脑敏锐度和提高记忆力的技巧-印度时报 | 9 science-backed tips to keep brain sharp and boost memory - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi7gFBVV95cUxOTVltOXBrNURid1AyVFBvbl9BTVVvXzk5OHJHUmR3Q1Fqb1RUeDUzS0N0bUgyYjM5UHZJREh3Y05GUjlxSWhvaFdzaTFhZDFqVEdjVTFyWHBwOGk1SE93c29IVWxWWUozdTZhUmVDbm9leU93cldzdDV4SS0yZFVNcG1xalJvZlluakwwUFE1ejE1dmt2dlhYTE1WZlVsZ3ZocTdmWDdCUG5QM0NoZEdHb1pxWnhsaEdyNHBuc25ZSE8ySVFTUjBDcURoeDVqZ24tWWw4aWJEZDNTTGwtQko4Ym1NSC01bGtKaDNTVktB0gHuAUFVX3lxTE5NWW05cGs1RGJ3UDJUUG9uX0FNVW9fOTk4ckdSZHdDUWpvVFR4NTNLQ3RtSDJiMzlQdklESHdjTkZSOXFJaG9oV3NpMWFkMWpUR2NVMXJYcHA4aTVIT3dzb0hVbFZZSjN1NmFSZUNub2V5T3dyV3N0NXhJLTJkVU1wbXFqUm9mWW5qTDBQUTV6MTV2a3Z2WFhMTVZmVWxndmhxN2ZYN0JQblAzQ2hkR0dvWnFaeGxoR3I0cG5zbllITzJJUVNSMENxRGh4NWpnbi1ZbDhpYkRkM1NMbC1CSjhibU1ILTVsa0poM1NWS0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;amp-story-grid-layer class="recircular" id="rcontent" template="vertical"&gt;&lt;div class="letterbox"&gt;&lt;p class="mid-heading"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You may also like&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc3 pa"&gt;10 reasons to consume a handful of cranb...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc5 pa"&gt;10 reasons to start consuming fish oil n...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/amp-story-grid-layer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 03:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>科学家首次在英国发现西尼罗河病毒- ScienceAlert | Scientists Discover West Nile Virus in The UK For The First Time - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxNZ3Y1ZDFYdEc0SWRYSy1IUU50SDNsSWhCUkxueGhxcW02QlpxYlZsMkRfNG9sLV9zSE5paGZ5Zkx6QjZtb2E4YU51aFRsYVFRanVRRWZDTUM4ekgtbW9qR0JZd2lRVUVyMUdmUXJab0Z5OGVkVUNmaEozWFM2cDRWQVAzbTIwLURoUS1iSXFLZEdfMVRqX09yZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;For the first time, traces of the West Nile  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="162576" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; have been found in mosquitoes in the UK, according to a report &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-detection-of-west-nile-virus-in-uk-mosquitoes"&gt;published this week&lt;/a&gt; by the UK Health Security Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what you need to know about the virus and the disease it causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is West Nile virus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne virus first identified in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3111838/"&gt;Uganda in 1937&lt;/a&gt;. It belongs to the same viral family as dengue and yellow  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="162576" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;. The virus is most commonly transmitted by &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Culex&lt;/em&gt; mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt;, particularly the species &lt;em&gt;Culex pipiens&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mve.12802"&gt;mainly feeds on birds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birds are the primary host for West Nile virus, and the virus &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus"&gt;spreads in a cycle&lt;/a&gt; from infected birds to mosquitoes and then back to birds. Occasionally, mosquitoes can transmit the virus to humans or other animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most human infections – &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus"&gt;around 80%&lt;/a&gt; – cause no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they are usually mild: fever, fatigue, headaches, body aches and sometimes nausea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in rare cases, around one in 150 infections, the virus can cause severe illness, including encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) or meningitis. Older adults, especially those over 50, are most at risk of serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus cannot normally be spread from person to person, though rare cases of transmission have occurred through &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/php/transmission/index.html"&gt;blood transfusions&lt;/a&gt; or from mother to baby during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How did it get to the UK?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the exact route isn't known, experts believe the virus may have arrived in the UK via migratory birds infected elsewhere. The mosquitoes probably picked up the virus after feeding on these birds during their northward journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detection was made as part of a routine mosquito surveillance programme run by the Animal and Plant Health Agency. Mosquitoes collected from marshlands in south-east England tested positive in PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests, which detect fragments of the virus's genetic material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that a positive PCR test doesn't necessarily mean the virus is infectious. After a mosquito becomes infected, the &lt;a href="https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(24)00230-5/fulltext"&gt;virus needs time&lt;/a&gt; – several days – to multiply inside the mosquito before it can be transmitted. And this process is highly temperature dependent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162591" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162591" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WestNileVirusParticle.jpg" alt="An illustration of a colorful virus particle" class="wp-image-162591 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WestNileVirusParticle.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WestNileVirusParticle-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WestNileVirusParticle-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162591" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of West Nile virus particles. (Science Photo Library/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can the virus spread in the UK?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK's relatively cool climate has, until now, helped keep mosquito-borne diseases at bay. At summer temperatures of around 15°C, it can take up to 100 days for the virus to develop inside a mosquito – longer than the insect's lifespan. In contrast, in hotter climates (above 30°C), this process can take just a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a local outbreak to occur, there would need to be a critical mass of infected birds and mosquitoes, with enough warm weather to sustain multiple cycles of transmission. So far, that hasn't happened in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/climate-change" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73046" data-postid="162576" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; could alter the equation. With rising global temperatures and longer, hotter summers, the conditions that allow  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="162576" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; such as West Nile to spread may become more common in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's happening elsewhere?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile virus was once limited to Africa and the Middle East but has spread significantly in recent decades. Large outbreaks have been recorded in countries including Greece, Romania, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008042"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt;, Russia and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US outbreak began in New York City in 1999 when an unusual number of birds were found dead in a city zoo. A &lt;a href="https://asm.org/magazine/2021/fall/we-are-all-connected-looking-at-the-big-picture-wi"&gt;veterinary pathologist&lt;/a&gt; at the Bronx Zoo, Tracey McNamara, helped link the bird deaths to the human illnesses being reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, the virus has spread across &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/data-maps/index.html"&gt;most of the US&lt;/a&gt;, Canada and parts of South America, resulting in over 60,000 reported human cases, 28,000 hospitalisations and more than 3,000 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, 19 European countries reported a total of &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/infectious-disease-topics/west-nile-virus-infection/surveillance-and-disease-data/monthly-updates"&gt;1,436 local cases&lt;/a&gt;, most in men over 65, with 125 deaths. Most were in Italy, Greece and Spain – countries with hot, mosquito-friendly summers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks were also reported in birds and horses, which are both susceptible to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Should UK residents be concerned?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes is noteworthy, experts emphasise that the public health risk remains very low. No human cases have been reported in the UK to date, and current summer temperatures are not yet conducive to sustained transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greater risk for most British people probably comes from travel – particularly to southern Europe, where cases are rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travellers are advised to take &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus"&gt;standard mosquito precautions&lt;/a&gt;: wear light-coloured clothing, long sleeves and trousers, and use insect repellent, especially in the evening when mosquitoes are most active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the virus is unlikely to spread widely in the UK. But as climate patterns shift, continued surveillance and public awareness will be key to staying ahead of the risk.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257295/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;
