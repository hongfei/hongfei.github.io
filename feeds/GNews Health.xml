Those born in the late 1950s or 1960s should get tested to determine their immunity, he added, as many people born around then don’t have vaccine documentation, and the measles vaccine was not as effective back then as it is now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6THJXNSA5JFXBN4M56R55CA4WU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Those born in the 1970s and 1980s, who probably received a single dose as a child, have adequate protection but should consider a booster if they’re in an area with a high measles transmission, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DFPLFNBYYNAPNHCAS2K4M3CSMQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’re born after the late 1980s and have received two doses, you do not need anything else, Hotez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3VTC43LCWNC63I2VSWJA2B2YXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To check your vaccination status against measles, Hotez said you can get a test that measures the level (or “titer”) of antibodies in your blood, which indicates your protection against the disease. These can be done through commercial labs or primary-care providers.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Este artículo estará disponible en español &lt;a href="https://eltiempolatino.com/author/factcheck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;en El Tiempo Latino&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., head of the Department of Health and Human Services, downplayed the seriousness of an ongoing measles outbreak in Texas, falsely claiming that people had been hospitalized “mainly for quarantine” and misleadingly stating that the situation is “not unusual.” The Texas outbreak is already larger than any single outbreak last year and has led to the first measles death in the U.S. since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vfigf-zGdjA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;remarks&lt;/a&gt; on Feb. 26 were his first public comments about the outbreak, which appears to have already spread to New Mexico. During a Cabinet meeting, a reporter asked President Donald Trump whether he was concerned, given &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/R8XT-4XUB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the day that an unvaccinated school-aged child had died from the viral disease. Trump asked Kennedy, who was in the room, to respond.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kennedy, Feb. 26: &lt;/strong&gt;We are following the measles epidemic every day. I think there’s 124 people who have contracted measles at this point, mainly in Gaines County, Texas. Mainly, we’re told, in the Mennonite community. There are two people who have died. We’re watching it, and there are about 20 people hospitalized, mainly for quarantine. We’re watching it, we put out a post on it yesterday, and we’re going to continue to follow it. Incidentally, there have been four measles outbreaks this year in this country. Last year, there were 16. So it’s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy made no mention of vaccination. During an outbreak, offering measles vaccines to susceptible people is an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6207419/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;important strategy&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/R8XT-4XUB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;limit the spread&lt;/a&gt; of measles, which is one of the most contagious diseases. Vaccination shortly after a measles exposure can also prevent illness or reduce the severity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A measles vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;first became&lt;/a&gt; available in the U.S. in 1963. By 2000, the disease was declared eliminated, meaning measles has not been continuously spreading for a year or more in a single area. Prior to a measles vaccine, there were 3 million to 4 million cases &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;each year&lt;/a&gt; in America, with 48,000 hospitalizations and 400 to 500 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has a long &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.factcheck.org/2023/08/scicheck-factchecking-robert-f-kennedy-jr/"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of sharing inaccurate information about vaccines, including the measles vaccine. He &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://x.com/AaronBlake/status/1894792427388498329/photo/1"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a forward to a 2021 book that Americans have been “misled … into believing that measles is a deadly disease and that measles vaccines are necessary, safe, and effective.” He added that measles outbreaks “have been fabricated to create fear” to “inflict unnecessary and risky vaccines on millions of children.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As recently as last month, while denying any responsibility for a deadly outbreak of measles in Samoa in 2019, Kennedy &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-jr-samoa-measles-kennedy-vaccines-pacific-42a9cb583c71f165699b16710884c474"&gt;falsely&lt;/a&gt; said during a &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.rev.com/transcripts/rfk-jr-confiramation-hearing-day-one"&gt;confirmation hearing&lt;/a&gt; that “most” of the people who died in the outbreak didn’t have measles and “we don’t know what was killing them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several of Kennedy’s Cabinet meeting comments are incorrect or misleading. Only one death, not two, has been reported. Children were hospitalized because they needed treatment, not “mainly for quarantine.” And while Kennedy is correct that last year there were more outbreaks than there have been so far this year, that leaves out significant context.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We were unable to identify any Feb. 25 posts from HHS or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about measles. A day after Kennedy’s remarks, however, the CDC posted a &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/723P-AZLZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on the outbreak, saying: “Vaccination remains the best defense against measles infection.” The agency said it “continues to be in close communication with Texas health authorities about the measles outbreak in West Texas, following the death of a child. HHS sends its deepest condolences to the family.” The measles death is the first in a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/woman-dies-measles-first-us-death-12-years-n385946" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;decade&lt;/a&gt; and the first death of a child from measles in the U.S. since &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5331a3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked about the death toll discrepancy, any posts and whether Kennedy was encouraging measles vaccination, Andrew G. Nixon, HHS’ director of communications, told us in an email on Feb. 26, “CDC is aware of the death of one child in Texas from measles, and our thoughts are with the family.” He added that the agency “continues to provide technical assistance, laboratory support, and vaccines as needed” to the health departments in Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services also confirmed the single death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are aware of one death associated with the outbreak,” Lara M. Anton, a senior press officer for the agency, told us in an email.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of Feb. 25, there were &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;124 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; of measles in Texas since late January, including 18 patients who have been hospitalized, according to state health officials. All but five cases have occurred in people who are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. Cases have been concentrated in and around Gaines County, a rural county with a large Mennonite population and &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lower&lt;/a&gt; measles vaccination rate. More than 100 of the cases have been in children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nine other measles cases, none of which have required hospitalization, have been reported in New Mexico as of Feb. 25, &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;per&lt;/a&gt; the state’s health department. Officials suspect measles spread from Texas, as all the cases have occurred in a county bordering Gaines County, but the origin of the spread has &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/vaccine/2025/2/?view=2180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;not yet&lt;/a&gt; been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;False Hospitalization Claim&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not true, as Kennedy said, that the measles hospitalizations were “mainly for quarantine.” He likely meant to say isolation, which &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/answers/public-health-and-safety/what-is-the-difference-between-isolation-and-quarantine/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;refers&lt;/a&gt; to separating people who are sick from those who are healthy to prevent the spread of a disease. Quarantine refers to the separation of people who have been exposed but are not yet showing symptoms. But in either case, he’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People in the hospital are there because they need treatment,” Anton told us. “We are not quarantining anyone in the hospital. People who are not vaccinated and have been exposed are asked to isolate at home.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paul A. Offit&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told us the hospital is the “last place” someone with the measles should go, unless they need care, due to the extreme contagiousness of measles and its relatively high complication rate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You do everything you can to keep measles out of the hospital because it’s a highly contagious virus and there’s a lot of vulnerable children in the hospital who are immunosuppressed and can’t be effectively vaccinated,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lara Johnson, a pediatrician and the chief medical officer at Covenant Children’s Hospital, the hospital in Lubbock, Texas, that is caring for kids with measles, including the child that died, said in an &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/person-dies-measles-west-texas-outbreak-rcna193812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a Feb. 26 &lt;a href="https://www.wcjb.com/video/2025/02/26/watch-lubbock-officials-give-briefing-measles-death-west-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt; that all of the hospitalized children had been admitted because of breathing issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We don’t hospitalize patients for quarantine,” she also said, noting that the hospital provides &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/covenant-health-hospital-lubbock-confirms-000220735.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;supportive care&lt;/a&gt;, including supplemental oxygen and medicine for fevers. No measles-specific treatments &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/01/scicheck-posts-mislead-about-measles-mmr-vaccine-amid-recent-outbreaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;exist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Johnson and other hospital officials said during the briefing that their children’s hospital had admitted “about 20” kids for measles, all of whom were unvaccinated. “Several” required intensive care. In addition, a “handful” of children with measles had been seen at the emergency room, but did not need further hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Summer Davies, a doctor who cared for the child who died from measles, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/26/measles-texas-unvaccinated-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Washington Post that the child who died had developed heart problems and was put on a ventilator. The child, she said, had been previously healthy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;Misleading Claim on Significance of Outbreak&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is correct that the U.S. typically has at least a few measles outbreaks each year, and that last year there were 16. According to the CDC, there were &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://perma.cc/W6DF-42FZ"&gt;285 measles cases in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, with 198 of those cases being outbreak-related. An outbreak is defined as three or more related cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year, as of Feb. 20, CDC had recorded a total of 93 cases, 86 of which had occurred in three outbreaks. (Those statistics are now out of date, as just Texas and New Mexico together have at least 133 cases.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the comparison — and the suggestion that this is all par for the course — is misleading. Not only should outbreaks be rare, experts say, but 2024 was a relatively bad year for measles. And the current outbreak has several features that make it particularly concerning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Offit called Kennedy’s statement that the U.S. has measles outbreaks every year “a little glib … as if this is acceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We eliminated measles from this country by the year 2000. With a two-dose vaccine, we eliminated the most contagious disease,” Offit said. But in part because of false information that Kennedy himself has put out for several decades, he said, a critical percentage of parents have chosen not to vaccinate their children, making outbreaks possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most parents vaccinate their children, but measles is so contagious that 95% of a community needs to be vaccinated or have prior immunity to prevent spread of the disease. A single dose of the measles vaccine is 93% &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;effective&lt;/a&gt; in preventing the disease and two are 97% effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although Kennedy suggests last year’s outbreaks were normal, 2024 had the &lt;a href="https://perma.cc/W6DF-42FZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fourth highest&lt;/a&gt; tally of confirmed measles cases in the U.S. since 2000. Only 2014, 2018 and 2019 were higher. The latter two &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6817e1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt; included outbreaks in Orthodox Jewish communities in New York. In 2019, such outbreaks contributed to an annual total of more than 1,200 cases, making it the worst year for measles since 1992. 2014 is when there was a large outbreak at &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6406a5.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Disneyland&lt;/a&gt; in California, which also caused cases in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The current outbreak, notably, is already larger than any single outbreak in 2024 — and is still growing. Health officials in &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; both say that additional cases are “likely.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The other concerning detail is the measles death, which, as the first pediatric measles death in 22 years, is highly unusual, and has occurred after only about 124 cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Offit said the typical death rate from measles is about 1 in 1,000. It could be a fluke, but such a high death rate at this point in the outbreak could mean that it is much bigger than is being recognized.&lt;/p&gt;

The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infant visited several King County public locations before the diagnosis, potentially exposing others. Measles can spread before symptoms appear, and the virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential exposure sites include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency is urging  those who may have been exposed at these locations to verify their vaccination status, and to a consult a healthcare provider if they develop a fever or rash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most symptoms of measles appear between 7 to 21 days after someone has been exposed, Public Health said. Some symptoms include a high fever that can last two to four days, cough, runny nose, pink eye, and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three medical facilitates listed above are notifying patients and families who may have been exposed, providing information about the exposure date and disease symptoms to watch for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A patient who came to the Seattle Children’s Emergency Department tested positive for measles," a Seattle Children's spokesperson said in a statement to KOMO News Thursday. "Emergency Department staff members followed appropriate screening processes of the patient and their family members at the visit and quickly implemented appropriate infection control procedures, which include isolating the patient and reporting to King County Public Health. We are notifying patients and families in the Emergency Department who may have been exposed, providing information about the exposure date and disease symptoms. For privacy reasons, we do not share information about specific patient cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can be confirmed with a sample of blood or saliva in a lab. The best way to prevent the spread of measles is by making sure you are up to date on the MMR vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid possibly spreading measles to others, do not go to a clinic or hospital without calling first to tell them you want to be checked for measles after an exposure. It is also important to limit contact with others, especially those without known immunity, and to wear a well-fitting mask if you do need to go to a healthcare facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/child-dies-measles-texas-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-deadly-illness-rfk-jr-department-state-health-services-snohomish-county-health-department-doh" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/local/child-dies-measles-texas-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-deadly-illness-rfk-jr-department-state-health-services-snohomish-county-health-department-doh" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Child dies in measles outbreak in Texas as Washington officials urge vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The most likely period for symptom onset is Feb. 27 to Mar. 18  for those exposed and not immune. Measles is contagious from about four days before a rash appears through four days after a rash appears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Health also emphasized the importance of the measles vaccine for the community at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles is easily spread from person to person. If one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected," said Dr. Eric Chow, Communicable Disease Chief for Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County. "We are seeing increases in measles cases within and outside the US. Talk to your doctor about checking your vaccination status and get vaccinated now if you aren’t already protected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency explained the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is highly effective, with two doses providing about 97% protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herd immunity requires approximately 95% vaccination coverage due to measles' high contagion rate. Currently, an estimated 87% of 2-year-olds and 72% of 4–6-year-olds in King County are up to date with their MMR vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, King County reported three measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information about measles and measles vaccination, including where to get measles vaccinations, can be found on King County's &lt;a href="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/health-safety/disease-illness/measles" target="_blank" title="https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/health-safety/disease-illness/measles" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WEBSITE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can measles be fatal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It usually doesn’t kill people, but it can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea. But about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized, the CDC said. Pregnant women who haven’t gotten the vaccine may give birth prematurely or have a low-birthweight baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis — which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s deadly “in a little less than 1% of cases, mainly in children,” said Scott Weaver, who works at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. “Children develop the most severe illness. The cause of death in these kinds of cases is usually pneumonia and complications from pneumonia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you need a booster if you got the MMR vaccine a while ago?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care professionals are sometimes tested for antibodies to measles and given boosters if necessary, Weaver said — even if they’ve already had the standard two doses as a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said people at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may also want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I don’t think everyone needs to go and run out to their doctor right now if they did receive two doses as a child,” he said. "If people would just get the standard vaccination, none of this would be happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO News</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 23:45:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2wJBVV95cUxQYjBDOEZIckVIUktZOE1QaWpGREl1VzEtbXFPUlFwbHBZRDlILXk3ZUwwYVRudnV2b2M0VkVWYjRjSm1pZkdvYy1BdUFERU5uUUp5OHBZaVZSaVhXcE80QjdQaFdXVFpsTlo4RFlPT3dsb2JDNVFzQ2pzZlFnSFBJOWd4eUNUY0xjQVU2RFNOcHZqTGVkT2djOEZna2g2QmpDMUtlM21kbjY5VXJqZE44TGFqdnhhelQyTUh1aGIxdWl0bnYzbUoxU0ZWTnVmbW9VOHJ4UXNBc1J2UFpQbkdhRUJoZmVTdmNzZ3hvWUp5WUU2VFhlSkhmclNBeXlmWHZBaHoxNXVjenJpUHc0ZlVqV0JTWWl1NUtzbERWck9kcEdQZDUwb0ZuX0Rfei1YS01MSG45ODJNdEd1MnRkOXdrYmVNdTN4dWVFOVNRdER0RTloUnBXTDAzM1dTdw</guid></item><item><title>First measles case confirmed in San Antonio area from first-grade classroom, school says - KENS5.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi6gFBVV95cUxOR1A0YVpmbklLSldfbnc4N182Q0NBN2FTSE9oNnlCMVZqZlZyLWY1N3lHbGozazBMMUp2SjVnQXRKTWpOTl90RVNwSnlMQzRuWlZncDZnOHFWU2x5Q210Nlg3b0g1V2dCQUdpR1hLcXlLci1rSTRDS1R5a3pneU5tbnFCRFlmWGJfa2Q0TGlNV2dFQlZmWFNFXzVzeFUyX000c2p6cUlWUnluSjdXNUc2VmVRTXE3V0ZuM2ZQTEFjUWxoc2JKZDJQU3U5cnUzM19Hb3A5WTQ1Qy1tRzh0ak44N01WWUJQVGRMR2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;The Legacy Traditional School in Cibolo has confirmed with KENS 5 that there is a measles case in a first-grade classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

And I'm really concerned that this thing is continuing to accelerate and expand," Hotez said Wednesday night in an interview on MSNBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Doctors in West Texas have described shock and fear over treatingng a disease they thought was something of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This is the first time I've had any professional experience with a measles outbreak," Dr. Lara Johnson, pediatrician and Chief Medical Officer at Covenant Children's and Covenant Health in Lubbock, who is currently treating measles patients from the outbreak in West Texas, told ABC news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I saw one travel-related case when I was in medical school, very briefly, but at that time, back in around 2000, we really thought that we'd eradicated measles from the United States and didn't have any anticipation of seeing any outbreaks here," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The outbreak in Texas is a prime example of the risk posed to unvaccinated communities. Vaccine exemptions among children in Gaines County, the epicenter of the outbreak, have grown dramatically in the past few years. Roughly 7.5% of kindergarteners had filed an exemption for at least one vaccine in 2013. 10 years later, that number rose to over 17.5% – one of the highest in all of Texas, state health data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As the response to the outbreak in Texas and New Mexico continues, with cases expected to significantly rise, public health experts like Hotez and Offit say they're watching Kennedy, as leader of the nation's health department, to encourage swift surveillance and widespread vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;"I want him to say to the American public that there's a safe way to prevent these outbreaks from happening so that we don't have the tragedy like what just happened in West Texas," Offit said. "There's so much in medicine you don't know. There's so much we can't do. This we know. This we can do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 23:24:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPRGJ6SUFObU85SkZfY2hVSWNRR3BLc2dVcXl1eGhyNkU1MmI1RGNaeGM5RndGQUt2X2xXYzBVdWo0bGRTUVNMWjlIclVSR3NUVE1yMVdCRXNzY09fU3lvaEJvaGQzUlYzaHVSR19pVXdlWW9NQURQcHlPMVdtYXZpUlhOSE82aDV4amJqeGFQRU04X1NaSlNXZktSVkx1R2VCbUswTWZaRi1lT0HSAbABQVVfeXFMTzljdmNyQVBGa0FHSFNaU1owMGR6NjIxcGg5RmgwM1gtUGVzQXFIb1p5T2otUl9LOFVpcHhfMlhXdVJ2emgtRUtRUmlvcGxtbmlqcW85bXNGSTB1TFI0bTh6clFYX2I2RWNnQWlidzNlZHNfQmtzTDFjVzdZS0I3NHd1bS1sM2E3U01Uc3IxVTNuXy03VUVOdjhOb0xGbXRvdnRVOXdXNHB0RzdyUEliTm4</guid></item><item><title>Could flu shot supply fall short this year?

But drugmakers can’t actually start making the doses until the FDA selects the strains. Shots &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/flu-shot-when-covid-vaccine-rcna169364" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:are usually available by the end of July or early August;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;are usually available by the end of July or early August&lt;/a&gt;, said Litjen Tan, co-chair of the flu shot advocacy group the National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The advisory committee meeting plays a key role, Tan said, because the flu virus is constantly evolving, requiring updates to the vaccine to provide the best protection. This year’s FDA flu meeting was scheduled for March 13, with a final decision from the agency on the strain expected shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Tan said that depending on the vaccine technology used, manufacturers can wait until late March for input from the FDA on strain selection to produce enough doses for the fall — but no longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If the strain selection happens much later than now, it’s going to be really, really tight, but the manufacturers will scramble and can make it happen,” Tan said. “If the delay is any longer than late March, it’s going to put manufacturers into a huge bind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The cancelation of the meeting comes amid a particularly bad flu season this year, with as many as 910,000 hospitalizations so far, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.

Typically, the agency must provide two weeks’ notice of a meeting to allow for a public comment period, meaning any advisory committee meeting likely wouldn’t happen until mid-March at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Paul Offit, a committee member and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said agency officials offered no explanation for the canceled meeting, nor did they indicate whether it would be rescheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“What worries me about this, I think it’s part of the bigger picture, which is this sort of dissolution of public health infrastructure, that we don’t need experts anymore,” said Offit, who helped develop a vaccine for rotavirus that was later sold to drugmaker Merck. “We don’t need experts advising us at the CDC, we don’t need experts advising us from the FDA. We’ll just figure it out ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Earlier this month, federal health officials &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-vaccine-committee-meeting-kennedy-postponed-hhs-rcna191659" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:also abruptly postponed a CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;also abruptly postponed a CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Asked whether he’s concerned about next season’s flu shot supply, Offit said, “I think we’ll have a flu vaccine this year, although I guess I shouldn’t say anything because everything seems unimaginable, and yet it still happens.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The flu vaccine is recommended for everyone over 6 months old. Data so far show that this year’s flu vaccine is 63% to 78% effective for preventing hospitalization in children and teens, and 41% to 55% effective for adults, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm?s_cid=mm7406a2_w" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC reported Thursday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC reported Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If drugmakers don’t have enough time to produce the vaccines because of the canceled meeting, “many lives that could be saved by vaccination will be lost,” said Dr. Tin Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This decision — and other federal efforts to undermine well-established science about vaccine safety — puts everyone at risk, especially when we are currently experiencing the worst U.S. flu season in more than a decade,” Tin Tan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Flu vaccine manufacturers are still preparing for next year’s flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a statement, a spokesperson for Sanofi said it has “already begun production for the 2025-2026 flu season in the Northern Hemisphere and will be ready to support final strain selections in time for the season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A spokesperson for GSK, another flu vaccine manufacturer, said it’s aware of the canceled meeting and is continuing to work with the FDA on its flu strain recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/flu-shot-supply-fall-short-year-fdas-canceled-meeting-sparks-worries-rcna194031" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NBCNews.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;NBCNews.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 23:01:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE0xSG0zbTVtS0FZdC00Q3R6ZDgxMUE3LURIUUFvTWxiaWR4dmE4OHVudU1vLUUxVGFqckRvejJHSEpSUGFVOVh5aXg1RXU1OXNEN2N3NWR3RUNTUVhvNF96S2I5d0t3VlFLVjNyUUFrM3NqeUk5YTlR</guid></item><item><title>Harsh flu season has health officials worried about brain complications in children - The Associated Press</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxQcHQwU0ZwbkNPaFhHbFYxbFJ3VTVTaGNLM09IbURhb2hpUzlJWXIxMGo4R3RwY19KYnphLVNrOXlvUFlabnBDN0l1X2FRSW94STF6Y0tTaTlvU25lS25KU3NYMmRMX0NkVXAxZVBEV2NOaFFLa0JmYjFnTXZmWlJRNnF0YVBOWEpBbEpNZE1DNTBLMzlnVEJFUlEwekNYUGdlQWxN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Associated Press</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 22:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQcHQwU0ZwbkNPaFhHbFYxbFJ3VTVTaGNLM09IbURhb2hpUzlJWXIxMGo4R3RwY19KYnphLVNrOXlvUFlabnBDN0l1X2FRSW94STF6Y0tTaTlvU25lS25KU3NYMmRMX0NkVXAxZVBEV2NOaFFLa0JmYjFnTXZmWlJRNnF0YVBOWEpBbEpNZE1DNTBLMzlnVEJFUlEwekNYUGdlQWxN</guid></item><item><title>Alzheimer’s was taking her memory, so she started taking a new drug : Shots - Health News - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0wFBVV95cUxQRmhFNHNVRjZRa3NWZ2gxSkZPNVNKRlZHVmdjS1hlcm5kM1JSZDRxSlF1YWkzMjVkOHdGUkNDTDU3NjhmRlczZ05sbVNVRnJQY0tSVXItNVBmTDVLeDNhc25lcDZwanlTVUtnZGxDcF91UEZjaS01cHdBcXZFYjNZcHdKU0o4SDVNeGZveWFIbHZCcV9Xb2g0RnlIck9JY2MwWjJsQzZfcFhLWFpjYlZVNXNDYWgtUzRCR19CS25kY19sNEduOTZGaDlON2FnWTZhNGhn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Drugs can't stop Alzheimer's disease yet. But sometimes, they can slow it down.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Things have just plateaued," says Myra Solano Garcia, 66, who developed memory problems in her 50s, and was diagnosed with Alzheimer's four years ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I can drive. I can take care of the house, I can cook," she says, "all of that normal stuff that people do."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Solano Garcia credits the drug &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/06/10/g-s1-3818/fda-advisors-back-alzheimer-drug-donanemab-despite-risks" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;donanemab&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which she began taking as part of a clinical trial at the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, now marketed as Kisunla, in July of 2024. It's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5300930/did-an-alzheimers-drug-give-sue-and-ken-bell-more-time-maybe" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;one of two drugs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; approved since 2023 that can clear the brain of sticky amyloid plaques, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But there is no way to know whether Kisunla is the reason Solano Garcia can still do so much.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We don't have the ability to say because you've taken the medication, you haven't declined," says &lt;a href="https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/lon-schneider/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Lon Schneider&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at USC's Keck School of Medicine who oversaw the donanemab trial there.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both Kisunla and the other approved drug, Leqembi, have been shown to slow down the mental decline of Alzheimer's by more than 25%. But that's in a group of patients—an individual may do much better, or not be helped at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A life, interrupted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Solano Garcia grew up in New Jersey as part of a Cuban-American family with lots of singers. She studied piano and voice in college. As a young adult, she made singing her career.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I played Maria in West Side Story in summer stock," she says. "I performed at Carnegie Hall and Fisher Hall."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Later, she moved to California and ran fundraising campaigns for colleges and universities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was in her early 50s that Solano Garcia began noticing problems with her memory.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A doctor told her she had attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and for years she mistakenly thought that was the problem. But her memory kept getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The turning point came during COVID, when she started a new job.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Three months in, I realized I couldn't do the work," she says. "I couldn't remember the people's names. I couldn't do the technology."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So Solano Garcia went to a neuropsychiatrist, who diagnosed her with Alzheimer's disease and referred her to doctors at USC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They asked, 'Would you like to be part of the [donanemab] trial?' and I said, you bet I would," she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A brain cleared of plaques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Solano Garcia began going in for monthly infusions, which she didn't mind, and mental tests, which she found frustrating. When the trial ended, she opted to continue taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It hasn't restored her memory or thinking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Solano Garcia says she isn't getting worse, at least not very quickly. Also, scans show that the beta-amyloid plaques that had built up in her brain are mostly gone.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That means she may be able to stop getting infusions of Kisunla.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Studies showed that it's safe for doctors to "treat until plaques are down to normal and then stop, and perhaps re-treat if plaques begin to grow back," USC's Schneider says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This option is one of the key differences between Kisunla and Leqembi, which was administered throughout its clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So at USC, doctors have a weekly meeting to discuss how patients are doing on Kisunla, and whether they might be candidates to stop taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Solano Garcia says doctors told her she's one of those patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm almost done with the infusions, so it's really exciting," she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Still no cure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Solano Garcia knows her brain is not what it once was.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I don't do well with numbers," she says. "I have difficulty remembering names. My poor husband, I forget what he tells me."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She's not able to return to her fundraising career. And she has lost much of her command of the piano.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So Solano Garcia maintains her household, runs errands, and volunteers with the Alzheimer's Association.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She also makes a weekly visit to a local memory care, where she sings for, and with, the residents.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We start out with the Star Spangled Banner, and we do some movie songs," she says, and "Coming 'Round the Mountain."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Solano Garcia says she's learned a lot from people in the unit, most of whom have advanced Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's humbling because they used to know all of this music," she says. "And I know that as time goes, I'll be just like them."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But she's hoping that Kisunla will postpone that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Encephalitis is swelling of the brain, while encephalopathy is a more general term for brain dysfunction that is not primarily an inflammatory condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ANE in 4 cases this season&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors said the CDC began receiving reports of ANE in children who died from flu in January, and the agency contacted state health departments to ascertain whether any pediatric flu-related deaths with IAE also involved a diagnosis of ANE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of February 8, the most recent date used in the study, 68 US children had been confirmed to have died from seasonal influenza. Among them, 9 had IAE (13%). (As of the CDC's latest FluView report &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/us-flu-still-high-covid-low-elevated-some-areas-rsv-declining-cdc-says"&gt;&lt;u&gt;on February 21&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, US pediatric flu deaths had risen to 86.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors said that, of the 9 pediatric deaths this season with IAE, 4 patients had fatal ANE. All 4 ANE deaths involved children under the age of 5 years, and all had laboratory-confirmed influenza A (H1N1). Two of the 4 children had been vaccinated against flu, 2 received the antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu), and all required mechanical ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-four percent of patients with fatal IAE had no underlying medical conditions, and only 20% had received flu vaccination 2 or more weeks before illness onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unknown if numbers are to be expected&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors compared IAE and ANE records among pediatric influenza deaths seen in the past 15 years. From the 2010-11 to 2024-25 flu seasons, officials reported 1,840 US pediatric flu-associated deaths, of which 166 (9%) involved IAE, ranging from 0% (2020-21 season) to 14% (2011-12 season).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 166 fatal pediatric flu-related patients with IAE, the median age was 6 years, 52% were female, and 40% were non-Hispanic White. In total 119 patients (72%) had influenza A, and 46 (28%) had influenza B virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of IAE patients (93%) required mechanical ventilation. Other documented acute complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (57; 34%), pneumonia (54; 33%), and sepsis (47; 28%). All but 11 patients died while hospitalized.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because no dedicated national surveillance for IAE or ANE exists, it is unknown if the numbers of cases this season vary from expected numbers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because no dedicated national surveillance for IAE or ANE exists, it is unknown if the numbers of cases this season vary from expected numbers," the authors wrote. "Health care providers should consider IAE in children with febrile illness and clinically compatible neurologic signs or symptoms, including but not limited to seizures, altered mental status, delirium, decreased level of consciousness, lethargy, hallucinations, or personality changes lasting &amp;gt;24 hours."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent research revealed that &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.16.24302894v1.full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;60%&lt;/a&gt; of Americans’ daily caloric intake comes from &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/lifestyle/ultraprocessed-foods-are-everywhere-how-bad-are-they/"&gt;ultra-processed foods.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;UPFs often contain high levels of sodium, refined sugars, cholesterol-spiking fats and other lab-based ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/05/lifestyle/expert-sounds-the-alarm-on-popular-foods-americans-eat-posing-serious-health-risks/"&gt;A recent study &lt;/a&gt;linked exposure to UPFs to 32 poor health outcomes, including a higher risk of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/29/lifestyle/junk-food-hikes-risk-of-32-diseases-and-health-conditions-including-death-scientists/"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/11/24/lifestyle/new-evidence-that-ultra-processed-foods-are-linked-to-cancer-study/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, metabolic syndrome, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/06/lifestyle/eating-predigested-junk-foods-is-making-you-fatter-experts-warn/"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, Type 2 &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/30/ultra-processed-food-linked-to-early-death-health-problems-scientists/"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and even premature death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study suggests that many of those adverse effects might be dangerously easy to acquire and shockingly long-lasting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;UPFs often contain high levels of sodium, refined sugars, cholesterol-spiking fats and other lab-based ingredients. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;beats_ – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Institute for Diabetes Research and Metabolic Diseases of the Helmholtz Center Munich at the University of Tübingen in Tübingen, Germany, found that even in the short term, consuming a high-calorie, UPF-rich diet impairs brain insulin responsiveness and increases liver fat in healthy men.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, and worse? These effects linger long after the eating period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Insulin regulates appetite and metabolism, and insulin resistance — like the kind triggered by UPFs — compromises this regulation and contributes to obesity, Type 2 diabetes and cognitive dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;The German team also found a link between ultra-processed food consumption and disruption in the brain’s reward learning response, suggesting that as little as five days of overeating can condition the brain for unhealthy eating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the study, 29 healthy male participants between 19 and 27 were divided into a high-caloric diet (HCD) group or a control group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over five days, the HCD group was told to eat additional daily calories from ultra-processed snack foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The control group maintained their regular diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study aimed to assess insulin-induced brain activity during three moments: before the high-caloric diet, during it, and one week after subjects went back to eating normally. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The research team found that brain insulin responsiveness increased for the group eating a high-caloric diet. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;On average, the HCD group increased their daily caloric intake by 1,200 calories. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Liver fat content in that group increased dramatically, while brain insulin responsiveness increased as well. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One week after resuming a regular diet, insulin activity was significantly lower in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An earlier study published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2799140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/a&gt; found that people could be at a higher risk of cognitive decline if more than 20% of their daily caloric intake is ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the German study, researchers were stunned at the effect short-term HCD had on reward learning, the process by which the brain learns to associate behaviors or stimuli with a positive or negative outcome and modify accordingly. This process is pivotal to motivation, decision making and food choices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To measure the relationship between HCD and reward learning, participants completed a task to assess their sensitivity to reward and punishment and the brain’s efficacy in processing and adapting to feedback.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;After a scant five days of eating UPFs, the HCD group displayed decreased reward sensitivity and increased punishment sensitivity. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Nelli Kovalchuk – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;After a scant five days of eating UPFs, the HCD group displayed decreased reward sensitivity and increased punishment sensitivity. After a week of normal eating, this trend abated but did not fully reverse itself. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Data suggest that a short-term HCD, rich in sugar and saturated fat, has prolonged effects on the brain that outlast the time-frame of its consumption,” according to the research team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Habitual daily intake of sweet and fatty snacks has been shown to increase neural responses to food, while decreasing the preference for low-fat food independent of changes in body weight and metabolism.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the study is gender specific and more research is needed, the team posits, “the brain response to insulin adapts to short-term changes in diet before weight gain and may facilitate the development of obesity and associated diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/adult-obesity-facts/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; defines obesity as having a body mass index of at least 30, and a shocking 20% of Americans meet that criteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly 60% of US adults with obesity have high blood pressure, and approximately 23% have diabetes. People with obesity are at a higher risk for a slew of health problems, including heart and liver disease on top of a multitude of chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

But drugmakers can’t actually start making the doses until the FDA selects the strains. Shots &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/flu-shot-when-covid-vaccine-rcna169364" target="_blank"&gt;are usually available by the end of July or early August&lt;/a&gt;, said Litjen Tan, co-chair of the flu shot advocacy group the National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The advisory committee meeting plays a key role, Tan said, because the flu virus is constantly evolving, requiring updates to the vaccine to provide the best protection. This year’s FDA flu meeting was scheduled for March 13, with a final decision from the agency on the strain expected shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Tan said that depending on the vaccine technology used, manufacturers can wait until late March for input from the FDA on strain selection to produce enough doses for the fall — but no longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“If the strain selection happens much later than now, it’s going to be really, really tight, but the manufacturers will scramble and can make it happen,” Tan said. “If the delay is any longer than late March, it’s going to put manufacturers into a huge bind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The cancelation of the meeting comes amid a particularly bad flu season this year, with as many as 910,000 hospitalizations so far, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. At least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-07.html" target="_blank"&gt;86 children and 19,000 adults have died&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In a statement, Andrew Nixon, a senior spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, said the agency will “make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Nixon didn’t answer questions about why the meeting was cancelled or whether the agency would seek input from its outside advisory committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children’s Hospital, who has advised the FDA on vaccines, said that if the agency decides not to seek input from its committee, it won’t be entirely in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;On Friday, a World Health Organization advisory committee is &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2025/02/28/default-calendar/who-information-meeting-on-the-composition-of-influenza-virus-vaccines-for-use-in-the-2025-2026-northern-hemisphere-influenza-season" target="_blank"&gt;convening to decide which strains should be included in next season’s flu vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for the Northern Hemisphere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That meeting usually guides the FDA’s strain selection, Levy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“FDA has the authority to advance flu vaccines without convening the VRBPAC committee,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear, however, whether drugmakers can begin producing doses for the U.S. based on the WHO’s recommendation or if they must wait for the FDA’s guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It also remains to be seen whether the FDA will reschedule its advisory committee meeting or forgo input on the flu strains from its expert panel altogether — which would be a first for the agency, according to Tan. Typically, the agency must provide two weeks’ notice of a meeting to allow for a public comment period, meaning any advisory committee meeting likely wouldn’t happen until mid-March at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Paul Offit, a committee member and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said agency officials offered no explanation for the canceled meeting, nor did they indicate whether it would be rescheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“What worries me about this, I think it’s part of the bigger picture, which is this sort of dissolution of public health infrastructure, that we don’t need experts anymore,” said Offit, who helped develop a vaccine for rotavirus that was later sold to drugmaker Merck. “We don’t need experts advising us at the CDC, we don’t need experts advising us from the FDA. We’ll just figure it out ourselves.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Earlier this month, federal health officials &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-vaccine-committee-meeting-kennedy-postponed-hhs-rcna191659" target="_blank"&gt;also abruptly postponed a CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Asked whether he’s concerned about next season’s flu shot supply, Offit said, “I think we’ll have a flu vaccine this year, although I guess I shouldn’t say anything because everything seems unimaginable, and yet it still happens.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The flu vaccine is recommended for everyone over 6 months old. Data so far show that this year’s flu vaccine is 63% to 78% effective for preventing hospitalization in children and teens, and 41% to 55% effective for adults, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm?s_cid=mm7406a2_w" target="_blank"&gt;CDC reported Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;If drugmakers don’t have enough time to produce the vaccines because of the canceled meeting, “many lives that could be saved by vaccination will be lost,” said Dr. Tin Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“This decision — and other federal efforts to undermine well-established science about vaccine safety — puts everyone at risk, especially when we are currently experiencing the worst U.S. flu season in more than a decade,” Tin Tan said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Flu vaccine manufacturers are still preparing for next year’s flu season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In a statement, a spokesperson for Sanofi said it has “already begun production for the 2025-2026 flu season in the Northern Hemisphere and will be ready to support final strain selections in time for the season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;A spokesperson for GSK, another flu vaccine manufacturer, said it’s aware of the canceled meeting and is continuing to work with the FDA on its flu strain recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 21:01:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxPeklBU2drV09oQmpndXh1M3ZlZi1qSGVNYjBSNzh0LXpoTGZGQ1B1eHRxajB4Qm0wckozSWJmdmwwQldpMllnaHBQak5DUmFEa0lQSC1UVzZrbEM0eXpLTlh3QmczNms5Ml9nUElnV29SbzRWVnRxS0pmb1MwdU0zcTI3WUJuR3FSWUIwUDdBLUJja3BLY0o1NUVlUlVhd2Z0MzZObkZpM1RmS3hDSXduUTNZaUZEU1FqQUFEZmpfa9IBVkFVX3lxTFBFUkg1STRTNlJBdzhWR1BhRFdLQjRBY09IRzQwbXJmQ3hqR1RyZ1I3Mjdrd2lHZGo2YW1ldHEyM3hQQnlWN0I1dUVMOFFTSHpObktmeXZR</guid></item><item><title>Infant from Orange County arrived at LAX with measles - ABC 10 News San Diego KGTV</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNeHNuc0JfWFFrY2JxbFJmN3gxYWs3NXdWYnB2eGRzVi1VaXZheHpjVDRGeFNJM2lfNlZta2JiczRSMVJzUk1xWHRHcjF3d3owbTd5X1JrTVE2aGRnQU9GbTJ4YXZORjJtaUpYODlTQV9CWlBITzE3RHB3dTlaZ3V6SWJiWTMxaGhF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (CNS) - An Orange County infant infected with measles arrived at Los Angeles International Airport following overseas travel earlier this month, and health officials started notifying passengers who were on the flight they had an increased risk of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, the patient arrived at LAX's Tom Bradley International Terminal on Feb. 19 aboard Korean Air flight KAL11/KE11. Health officials said anyone who was at Terminal B that day between 1 and 4 p.m. may be at risk of developing measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials were working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to notify passengers who were sitting in specific seats on the flight that may have increased their risk of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles County health department did not release any specifics about the patient, but the Orange County Health Care Agency issued a statement saying it is an infant who was returning home to Orange County following international travel. Orange County officials said there were no additional community exposures beyond the airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who potentially may have been exposed were urged to confirm their vaccination status or possible immunization through prior infection. Those who are not immune could be at risk of developing measles between seven and 21 days from exposure, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles is a serious respiratory disease that spreads easily through the air and on surfaces, particularly among people who are not already protected from it," Dr. Muntu Davis, Los Angeles County Health Officer, said in a statement. "A person can spread the illness to others before they have symptoms, and it can take seven to 21 days for symptoms to show up after exposure. Measles can lead to severe disease in young children and vulnerable adults. The best way to protect yourself and your family from infection is with the highly effective measles vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common symptoms of measles include a high fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, tiny white spots inside the mouth, and a rash that develops three to five days after other signs of illness, starting at the face then spreading to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, 93 measles cases have been reported in the United States this year, but the number is likely to rise due to current outbreaks occurring in Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Copyright 2025, City News Service, Inc.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ST. LOUIS COUNTY, Mo. — Researchers at Washington University identified the first invasive longhorned tick ever found in &lt;a href="/article/sports/outdoors/where-to-send-ticks-bite-st-louis-county-illinois-reporting/63-26825545-04ed-4455-a1a8-a09b7699d1b8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;suburban St. Louis County&lt;/a&gt;, the university said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sesame-seed-sized arachnid is considered a "serious threat," according to the &lt;a href="https://agriculture.mo.gov/veterinarians/longhorned-tick-flier.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Missouri Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt;. The tick has transmitted diseases to domestic animals and livestock in Australia, New Zealand and multiple countries in eastern Asia. It has also killed animals from blood loss during severe infestations.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WashU undergraduate researcher Sam Ko collected and identified the tick in the county.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have only found one longhorned tick in St. Louis County so far, but it’s likely that there are more,” said &lt;a href="https://www.adalsteinssonlab.org/people"&gt;Solny Adalsteinsson&lt;/a&gt;, who leads the Tyson Research Center's tick and wildlife ecology team.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The university said it is working to expand tick collection efforts throughout the region after the find and will partner with St. Louis County's "&lt;a href="/article/sports/outdoors/where-to-send-ticks-bite-st-louis-county-illinois-reporting/63-26825545-04ed-4455-a1a8-a09b7699d1b8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Tick Watch STL&lt;/a&gt;" program, which allows residents to send in ticks to Vector Borne Disease Prevention in Olivette.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county also published a public dashboard for the tick collection program which includes a map of tick collection locations and detailed information of each type of tick.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to give residents the tools to make decisions in their best interest and let them know that we are here for them when they have questions or need support,” said J. Brooke Dedrick, a vector-borne disease prevention specialist with St. Louis County’s Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missouri does not have a state-wide tick submission program, but it does allow residents to report certain tick-borne diseases and conditions to local health agencies or the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services. &lt;a href="https://health.mo.gov/living/healthcondiseases/communicable/communicabledisease/pdf/reportablediseaselist2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Click here to learn more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DALLAS — A measles case was reported in North Texas on Wednesday, bringing the statewide total of reported measles cases to 125, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children ages 5 years old and younger are at the highest risk of serious health complications caused by measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control. State officials on Wednesday said a school-aged child &lt;a href="/article/news/health/texas-measles-death-outbreak-lubbock/285-636380ac-1d18-4404-999d-b804f40137af" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;died in Lubbock&lt;/a&gt;. The child, whose exact age was not released, was hospitalized last week and tested positive for measles. While one death has been reported, 18 people have been hospitalized in West Texas, officials say. The unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles in Rockwall County is also hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious and symptoms usually begin 7 to 14 days after infection, the CDC said. The disease spreads through infected droplets in the air and the virus can remain infectious up to two hours after an infected person leaves.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is "probably the most infectious contagious disease on the planet," said Dr. Suzanne Whitworth, division chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Cook Children's in Fort Worth&lt;a href="/article/news/health/answers-to-your-questions-and-general-guidelines-on-measles-outbreak-in-texas/287-48e4c451-22e5-403b-b810-bfda235c3d03" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt; previously told WFAA.&lt;/a&gt; "We know that about 40% of kids under the age of five who get measles are gonna wind up in the hospital, and nobody wants that." &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination is the best defense against measles, according to the CDC. The vaccine to protect against measles is the MMR vaccine, which covers measles, mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public and private schools are required to report the percentage of vaccinated children to the Texas Department of Health and Human Services. The department's data shows that 187 public school districts and private schools had a kindergarten measles (MMR) vaccination rate of less than 95% in the 2023-2024 school year. Herd immunity for measles is achieved when 95% of the population is vaccinated, according to the World Health Organization. Herd immunity is achieved when enough community members are immune to a virus so that it inhibits spread. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, kindergarten vaccination rates only tell a portion of the story. Herd immunity is only achieved when the entire community has a vaccination rate of over 95%. Communities with lower vaccination rates are at greater risk of a breakout of measles infections, according to the&lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/what-to-know-about-measles-and-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; Johns Hopkins School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all public and private North Texas schools, ten private schools had the lowest vaccination rate for measles (the MMR vaccine) last school year: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 62 North Texas schools had a 100% vaccination rate among kindergartners in the 2023-2024 school year. Here are the measles vaccination rates for every North Texas school and public school district. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_embed"&gt;
                                    
                                &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of Health and Human Services also breaks down school-age vaccination rates by county. According to the latest data from the 2023-2024 school year, zero North Texas counties have a kindergarten measles vaccination rate high enough to achieve herd immunity. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wise County had the lowest kindergarten vaccination rates relative to other North Texas counties, according to Texas Department of Health and Human Services data. Rockwall County, which so far has the only reported measles infection in North Texas, had a kindergarten vaccination rate of 91% during the 2023-2024 school year. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson and Dallas counties had the highest vaccination rate, around 94%.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_embed"&gt;
                                    
                                &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statewide, the kindergarten measles vaccination rate has steadily declined, from nearly 97% in 2019 to 94.3% last school year. If you're concerned about your school-age child or loved one becoming infected, Dr. Whitworth reminds families the vaccine has saved countless lives.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

The most serious of those is in west Texas, where the virus is spreading largely among the Mennonite community in which rates of vaccination are low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Nine states in total have reported cases of measles. In addition to Kentucky and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, that includes Alaska, California, Georgia, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Steven Stack, who heads the public health department in Kentucky, urged people to get vaccinated.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is already known about this topic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC routinely monitors influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE). Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all eligible persons aged ≥6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is added by this report?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interim 2024–2025 seasonal influenza VE estimates were derived from four U.S. VE networks. Among children and adolescents, VE was 32%, 59%, and 60% in outpatient settings (three networks) and 63% and 78% against influenza-associated hospitalization (two networks). Among adults, VE was 36% and 54% in outpatient settings (two networks) and 41% and 55% against influenza-associated hospitalization (two networks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the implications for public health practice?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination with the 2024–2025 influenza vaccine reduced the risk for influenza-associated outpatient visits and hospitalization. These findings support recommendations that all eligible persons aged ≥6 months should receive an annual influenza vaccination. Vaccination should be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="abstract" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Abstract"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months in the United States. Interim influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated among patients with acute respiratory illness–associated outpatient visits and hospitalizations from four VE networks during the 2024–25 influenza season (October 2024–February 2025). Among children and adolescents aged &amp;lt;18 years, VE against any influenza was 32%, 59%, and 60% in the outpatient setting in three networks, and against influenza-associated hospitalization was 63% and 78% in two networks. Among adults aged ≥18 years, VE in the outpatient setting was 36% and 54% in two networks and was 41% and 55% against hospitalization in two networks. Preliminary estimates indicate that receipt of the 2024–2025 influenza vaccine reduced the likelihood of medically attended influenza and influenza-associated hospitalization. CDC recommends annual receipt of an age-appropriate influenza vaccine by all eligible persons aged ≥6 months as long as influenza viruses continue to circulate locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="introduction" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Introduction"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of continual evolutionary changes in influenza viruses, CDC regularly monitors* influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE). Influenza vaccination prevents hundreds of thousands of outpatient medical visits, tens of thousands of hospitalizations, and thousands of deaths from influenza every year.&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends annual seasonal influenza vaccination for all persons aged ≥6 months (&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;). In March 2024, after the absence of detections of influenza B/Yamagata lineage viruses since 2020,&lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt; the Food and Drug Administration recommended changing from a quadrivalent vaccine (including four influenza virus antigens) to a trivalent vaccine, containing three influenza virus antigens. During the 2024–25 influenza season, most influenza viruses detected in the United States were influenza A viruses (97% of positive specimens); among subtyped influenza A–positive specimens, 52% were influenza A(H3N2), and 47% were A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.&lt;sup&gt;¶&lt;/sup&gt; This report provides interim estimates of effectiveness of any 2024–2025 influenza vaccine (i.e., trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine, or trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine) against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza for persons in the outpatient and inpatient settings from four U.S. VE surveillance networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="methods" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Methods"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Data Source and Collection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyses were conducted using data from four CDC-affiliated VE networks, all of which use a test-negative, case-control design to evaluate influenza VE: 1) Investigating Respiratory Viruses in the Acutely Ill (IVY), 2) the New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN), 3) U.S. Flu Vaccine Effectiveness (U.S. Flu VE), and 4) the Virtual SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, and Other respiratory viruses Network (VISION). These analyses include child and adolescent and adult patients who received medical care (outpatient or inpatient) for an acute respiratory illness (ARI) during the 2024–25 influenza season. Case-patients were those persons with ARI who received a positive influenza molecular assay test result,** and control patients were those with ARI who received a negative influenza molecular assay test result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setting and age of enrolled patients differed by network (&lt;a id="B1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#B1_down"&gt;Box&lt;/a&gt;). IVY enrolled hospitalized patients aged ≥18 years. NVSN enrolled child and adolescent patients (aged 6 months–17 years) in the outpatient setting,&lt;sup&gt;††&lt;/sup&gt; as well as those admitted to a hospital. U.S. Flu VE enrolled child and adolescent (aged 8 months–17 years) and adult (≥18 years) patients in the outpatient setting. VISION included child and adolescent (aged 6 months–17 years) and adult (aged ≥18 years) patients in the outpatient setting and those admitted to a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Data Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess effects of vaccination on likelihood of influenza illness, VE was estimated as (1 − adjusted odds ratio) × 100% using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for geographic region, age, calendar time of illness, and other prespecified confounders.&lt;sup&gt;§§&lt;/sup&gt; Patients were considered to be vaccinated if they received ≥1 dose of the 2024–2025 seasonal influenza vaccine ≥14 days before the date of ARI onset or clinical encounter.&lt;sup&gt;¶¶&lt;/sup&gt; Patients were excluded*** if they were vaccinated &amp;lt;14 days before the index date or had received a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay test result (&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;). IVY, NVSN, and U.S. Flu VE calculated VE against influenza A virus subtypes A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), when possible. VE point estimates for each network are reported, with 95% CIs included in the tables of this report; 95% CIs that exclude zero were considered statistically significant. For each network and patient age group, VE and 95% CIs were interpreted as the percentage of specific influenza outcomes prevented. SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute) and R (version 4.4; R Foundation) were used to conduct the analyses. IVY, NVSN, and U.S. Flu VE activities were reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and were conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.&lt;sup&gt;†††&lt;/sup&gt; VISION activities were reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.&lt;sup&gt;§§§&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="results" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Results"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from the IVY network included 3,175 hospitalized adult patients aged ≥18 years with ARI (&lt;a id="T1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#T1_down"&gt;Table 1&lt;/a&gt;) (Supplementary Table 1, &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/176587"&gt;https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/176587&lt;/a&gt;). NVSN included 4,611 patients aged &amp;lt;18 years with ARI, including 2,969 seen in outpatient settings and 1,642 who were hospitalized. Among 3,344 patients with ARI in the outpatient setting included in the U.S. Flu VE network, 1,134 were patients aged &amp;lt;18 years, and 2,210 were adults. VISION data included 139,558 outpatient encounters (36,919 among patients aged &amp;lt;18 years and 102,639 among adults) and 32,671 hospitalized encounters (1,638 among patients aged &amp;lt;18 years and 31,033 among adults).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Influenza Vaccination Status Among Control Patients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among control patients (i.e., those patients with ARI and a negative influenza test result) aged &amp;lt;18 years, the percentage vaccinated ranged from 22% (VISION) to 34% (NVSN) in outpatient settings, and from 27% (VISION) to 40% (NVSN) in the inpatient setting (&lt;a id="T2_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#T2_down"&gt;Table 2&lt;/a&gt;). Among all adult control patients, the percentage vaccinated was 34% in outpatient settings (U.S. Flu VE and VISION) and ranged from 35% (IVY) to 39% (VISION) in the inpatient setting. Among control patients aged ≥65 years, 54% (VISION) to 59% (U.S. Flu VE) in outpatient settings and 45% (IVY) to 46% (VISION) in the inpatient setting were vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;VE against ARI in Outpatient and Inpatient Settings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Children and adolescents.&lt;/b&gt; Among persons aged &amp;lt;18 years, VE against any influenza-associated ARI was 32% (U.S. Flu VE), 59% (NVSN), and 60% (VISION) in outpatient settings and 63% (NVSN) and 78% (VISION) against influenza-associated hospitalization. Against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, VE was 72% (NVSN) and 53% (U.S. Flu VE) in outpatient settings, and 63% (NVSN) against influenza-associated hospitalization. Against influenza A(H3N2), VE was 42% (NVSN) in outpatient settings and 55% (NVSN) against influenza-associated hospitalization. The estimate of VE in outpatient settings in the U.S. Flu VE network was not statistically significant (16%; 95% CI = −34% to 49%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adults.&lt;/b&gt; Among persons aged ≥18 years, VE against any influenza-associated ARI was 36% (U.S. Flu VE) and 54% (VISION) in outpatient settings and 41% (IVY) and 55% (VISION) against influenza-associated hospitalization. Effectiveness against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was 42% in outpatient settings (U.S. Flu VE) but was not statistically significant against influenza-associated hospitalization in the IVY network (39%; 95% CI = −14% to 67%). Effectiveness against influenza A(H3N2) was 51% (IVY) against influenza-associated hospitalization but was not statistically significant in the outpatient setting (25%; 95% CI = −6% to 48%, U.S. Flu VE network).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among adults aged 18–64 years, VE against any influenza-associated ARI in outpatient settings was 37% (U.S. Flu VE) and 56% (VISION); VE against hospitalization was 48% (IVY) and 51% (VISION). Among adults aged ≥65 years, VE against any influenza-associated ARI was 51% (VISION) in outpatient settings and was 38% (IVY) and 57% (VISION) against hospitalization; VE was not statistically significant in the outpatient setting in the U.S. Flu VE network (VE = 18%; 95% CI = −69% to 60%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Genetic Characterization of Influenza Viruses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of February 3, 2025, a total of 286 influenza A(H3N2) viruses were genetically characterized, including 26 (9%) from patients in IVY, 200 (70%) from the U.S. Flu VE network, and 60 (21%) from NVSN; all belonged to the hemagglutinin (HA) clade 2a.3a.1, which includes the A(H3N2) strain selected for the 2024–2025 cell-grown influenza vaccine (A/Massachusetts/18/2022) (Supplementary Table 2, &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/176590"&gt;https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/176590&lt;/a&gt;) Among 158 sequenced A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, five (3%) were from IVY, 80 (51%) were from the U.S. Flu VE network, and 73 (46%) were from NVSN. Among these, three from IVY, 55 from U.S. Flu VE, and 46 from NVSN belonged to HA clade 5a.2a, and two from IVY, 25 from U.S. Flu VE, and 27 from NVSN belonged to HA clade 5a.2a.1. The HA clade 5a.2a.1 includes the A(H1N1)pdm09 strain selected for the 2024–2025 cell-grown influenza vaccine (A/Wisconsin/67/2022).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="discussion" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Discussion"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These interim estimates of 2024–25 VE indicate that influenza vaccination was effective in preventing medically attended influenza-associated illness in children, adolescents, and adults in the United States. Among children and adolescents, VE against medically attended influenza ranged from 32% to 60% in outpatient settings and from 63% to 78% against influenza-associated hospitalization. Among adults, VE against medically attended influenza was 36% and 54% in two outpatient settings and 41% and 55% against influenza-associated hospitalization. Despite increased circulation of influenza A(H3N2) viruses, which are generally associated with lower VE (&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;), estimates from this influenza season were consistent with those from the 2023–24 season and seasons associated with higher VE over the last 15 years (&lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;). These estimates are also similar to interim estimates from Canada for the 2024–25 influenza season, which estimated VE to be 54% overall (&lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt;), and estimates from South America for the 2024 southern hemisphere influenza vaccine, which estimated VE against influenza A to be 34% overall (&lt;i&gt;6&lt;/i&gt;). Given the high levels of influenza activity and severity in the United States this season, increasing influenza vaccination could reduce influenza-associated illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations and deaths.&lt;sup&gt;¶¶¶&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VE estimates and associated confidence levels included in this report might reflect regional variations in circulating viruses. In U.S. Flu VE, most subtyped influenza A specimens (67%) were influenza A(H3N2) compared with 48% in NVSN. The U.S. Flu VE network did not find statistically significant VE against influenza A(H3N2) in the outpatient setting among child and adolescent patients or among adult patients. The VE estimates against influenza A(H3N2) are similar to findings from the 2018–19 season (&lt;i&gt;7&lt;/i&gt;) and to findings from Europe during the 2024–25 influenza season (&lt;i&gt;8&lt;/i&gt;). To address evolutionary changes in the influenza virus, the composition of influenza vaccines is reviewed annually; influenza vaccines are updated to protect against the influenza viruses that data indicate are most likely to be circulating during the following influenza season. When circulating viruses are antigenically different from the vaccine viruses, influenza VE can be reduced.****&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, these VE estimates are preliminary, and end-of-season estimates might be different as influenza continues to spread during the 2024–25 season. Second, influenza vaccination status might be misclassified in some networks, which could affect VE estimates. Vaccines administered in pharmacies are routinely reported to jurisdictional immunization information systems (IISs), although vaccination clinics conducted in nontraditional settings such as workplaces might not be reported to IISs. Third, patients who had received ≥1 dose of the 2024–2025 influenza vaccine were considered vaccinated; however, children aged 6 months–8 years are recommended to receive 2 doses if they have not previously received ≥2 doses. Therefore, some children who were classified as vaccinated might not have been fully vaccinated, which could reduce VE estimates. Finally, the potential for unmeasured confounding exists, because networks did not control for variables such as previous vaccination, previous influenza virus infection, or underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Implications for Public Health Practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination is the best way to prevent influenza and influenza-associated hospitalization. Findings in this report show that vaccination with the 2024–2025 influenza vaccine reduced the likelihood of medically attended influenza and support CDC’s recommendation that all persons aged ≥6 months be vaccinated against influenza (&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;). These findings also support the strong protective effect influenza vaccination has against influenza-associated hospitalization, demonstrating the importance of vaccination to reduce more severe influenza-associated complications. Eligible persons aged ≥6 months who have not received the 2024–2025 influenza vaccine should get vaccinated as long as influenza viruses circulate locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

* Aged 6 months–17 years (NVSN and VISION); 8 months–17 years (U.S. Flu VE).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; VE was estimated using the test-negative design comparing odds of receipt of 2024–2025 influenza vaccination among persons with an acute respiratory illness who received a positive influenza test result with those among persons who received a negative influenza or SARS-CoV-2 test result. ORs were estimated using logistic regression; VE was calculated as (1 − adjusted OR) × 100%. Firth logistic regression was used for estimates from IVY&lt;br&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;¶&lt;/sup&gt; All networks were adjusted for geographic region, age, and calendar time. IVY, U.S. Flu VE, and VISION were adjusted for sex and race and ethnicity.&lt;br&gt;
** As of February 1, 2025, most influenza viruses detected have been influenza A viruses (97% of positive specimens).&lt;br&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Doctors around the US have anecdotally reported an uptick of children critically ill with the flu developing severe, life-threatening neurological complications, which can be marked by seizures, delirium, hallucinations, decreased consciousness, lethargy, personality changes, and abnormalities in brain imaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's long been known that the seasonal flu can cause such devastating complications in some children, many with no underlying medical conditions. But doctors have begun to suspect that this year's flu season—&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/sick-right-now-flu-is-resurging-to-yet-a-higher-peak-this-season/"&gt;the most severe in over 15 years&lt;/a&gt;—has taken a yet darker turn for children. On February 14, for instance, health officials in Massachusetts released &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/influenza-neurologic-complications-advisory-february-14-2025/download"&gt;an advisory for clinicians&lt;/a&gt; to be on alert for neurological complications in pediatric flu patients after detecting a "possible increase."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the anecdata coming in, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed all the data it has on neurological complications from flu this year and seasons dating back to 2010. Unfortunately, existing surveillance systems for flu do not capture neurological complications in pediatric cases overall—but they do capture such detailed clinical data when a child dies of flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a3.htm?s_cid=mm7406a3_w"&gt;An analysis of that data&lt;/a&gt;, published today in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, can't definitively say that this year is out of the norm. For one thing, the flu season is not yet over. But the data so far does suggest it may be one of the more severe seasons in the last 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the CDC received reports of a severe neurological complication called influenza-associated acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE). ANE is a severe form of the more general category of influenza-associated encephalopathy or encephalitis (IAE), meaning brain dysfunction or inflammation from the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a child dies of the flu, clinicians are required to fill out a standardized case report form from the CDC, which collects a large variety of data, including complications. Encephalopathy or encephalitis are included as a checkbox on the form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 2010 and February 8, 2025, 1,840 children died of the flu. Of those, 166 had IAE checked off as a complication. IAE was most prevalent in children aged 2 to 4 but affected children in all age groups under 18. More than half of the cases (54 percent) had no underlying medical conditions, and most (80 percent) were unvaccinated against the flu.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr.'s reaction to a rising number of measles cases in Texas.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "There's a growing measles outbreak in Texas, which has claimed the life of a school-aged kid who'd not been vaccinated. It's the first measles-related death in a decade because they eradicated it, they got rid of it so we wouldn't have to deal with it," the 69-year-old said at the top of Thursday's live Hot Topics discussion, before criticizing RFK Jr.'s insistence that "there's no cause for alarm" before playing a clip of him saying that he's "following the measles epidemic every day."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Goldberg alleged that RFK Jr. spread false information amid his response to the outbreak, particularly taking issue with his assessment that the development wasn't unusual.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Actually, it is unusual, because it was eradicated. You're not giving out the proper information. This is your job, dude. People are gonna die if they believe what you're saying and they don't check. I'm very worried about this reaction," Goldberg continued. "It's kind of like, 'Yeah, this is not a big deal.' It is a big deal and it's a big deal for mothers, expectant mothers, mothers that don't even know that they're pregnant. They have no idea. To flippantly put it off and say that this is what happens all the time — it doesn't. So, what are you going to do about it, RFK? What are you gonna do?"

&lt;p&gt;When dermatologist Dr. Nicholas Perricone unveiled a diet he promised would act as a “three-day nutritional facelift” in his bestselling book, “&lt;a href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FWrinkle-Cure-Unlock-Cosmeceuticals-Youthful%2Fdp%2F0446677760%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fdib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.yqxbn7XTB9lGgNfaJ2T-p6nkFucFyn0cIb6FwoxIuq8Dh8qI9pE82CSDLefu8kNGwv33D76wqSZzMD6SgvTHEikW1Sx9Uh7SsZDGXM28Ia2QBL7R1Ed1ixxeQyrRiAdAOjMq8ucT9g5zaJIKfuqtbnmoQfejEtgEoSKa6O6Sblm1iopz2ztEq4Q2dxKJDfHdiPErGEE_grj7zLtuUrfHd_bKA8uEy-C_7uttBccL8KQ.w0Tthh5WuJtXz5gfTNWX29A_2QNCuL84lx9vlwnEIY4%26dib_tag%3Dse%26hvadid%3D694562032792%26hvdev%3Dc%26hvexpln%3D67%26hvlocphy%3D9197632%26hvnetw%3Dg%26hvocijid%3D307442656608753823--%26hvqmt%3De%26hvrand%3D307442656608753823%26hvtargid%3Dkwd-301078282219%26hydadcr%3D15521_13558544%26keywords%3Dthe%20wrinkle%20cure%20book%26mcid%3Da3a45f1a44723c6d93d8c1aba3932b30%26qid%3D1740672374%26sr%3D8-1%26tag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2025%2F02%2F27%2Fhealth%2Fceleb-dermatologists-3-day-nutritional-facelift-diet-revealed%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The Wrinkle Cure&lt;/a&gt;,” he had his fair share of skepticism. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Famed journalist Diane Sawyer told him she believed his “claims were overstated and that she planned to challenge [him],” Perricone recalls in his new book, “&lt;a href="https://r.nypostlink.com?btn_ref=org-19984c113c692001&amp;amp;btn_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBeauty-Molecule-Introducing-Neuroceuticals-Breakthrough%2Fdp%2F1250286794%3Ftag%3Dnypost-20%26asc_refurl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2025%2F02%2F27%2Fhealth%2Fceleb-dermatologists-3-day-nutritional-facelift-diet-revealed%2F%26asc_source%3Dweb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The Beauty Molecule&lt;/a&gt;,” due out April 15. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But when Sawyer and Oprah Winfrey tested the nutritional facelift, they “could not believe their eyes when they witnessed the effects of the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/health/this-diet-lowers-risk-cancer-even-if-you-dont-lose-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;anti-inflammatory diet&lt;/a&gt; after just three days.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“I designed this 3-day diet to reduce puffiness, enhance contours and firm the jawline,” he told The Post. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Subbotina Anna – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soon, many others were blown away by how much &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/24/health/three-gym-rats-in-their-70s-and-80s-reveal-how-they-stay-fit-its-like-a-game-of-whack-a-mole/"&gt;younger they looked&lt;/a&gt; — and how energetic they felt — after following the meal plan for only 72 hours. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed this 3-day diet to reduce puffiness, enhance contours and firm the jawline — and including salmon twice daily will leave your skin firmer and more radiant,” Perricone told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/21/health/neurologist-reveals-3-ingredient-dinner-to-prevent-alzheimers/"&gt;Salmon&lt;/a&gt; is a crucial component of this diet. “You must eat salmon at least twice a day for the ideal effect,” he wrote, vowing it will “change your skin, making it firmer and more lustrous.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s because salmon provides good-quality, easily digestible protein that converts into amino acids “necessary to repair the body on a cellular level.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While it might sound counterintuitive, Perricone claims a “carbohydrate-heavy and protein-light diet leads to the loss of contours in the face — the sought-after chiseled look of a well-defined jawline, cheekbones and eyes.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salmon is also a great source of the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/11/health/im-a-holistic-doctor-3-foods-that-mimic-ozempic/"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; EPA and DHA — which can help your brain, heart, metabolism, mood and skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Salmon is a great source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;volff – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Aside from salmon, the “three-day nutritional facelift” focuses on salads, berries and dark, leafy greens like spinach, arugula and kale. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/17/health/i-ate-only-raw-fruits-and-veggies-for-3-months-and-lost-77-lbs/"&gt;Berries&lt;/a&gt; are full of anti-inflammatory antioxidants that help neutralize free radicals, reduce oxidative stress and protect against cell damage. They’re also a good source of vitamin C, which aids in collagen production. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dark, leafy greens contain chlorophyll, which can help reduce redness and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/17/health/greek-island-with-almost-no-dementia-the-two-drinks-they-love/"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, as well as fight acne and eczema.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They’re also rich in vitamin E, which can lessen the effect of sun damage, beta-carotene, which reduces the appearance of fine lines and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/26/health/anti-aging-breakthrough-stop-wrinkles-gray-hair-with-these-hormones/"&gt;wrinkles&lt;/a&gt; — and vitamin K, which helps keep the skin nice and plump. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, Perricone’s diet demands at least six glasses of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/19/health/chemical-in-us-drinking-water-linked-to-higher-risk-of-2-cancers/"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; a day. He advises drinking two eight-ounce cans of hydrogen water — water that’s been enhanced with molecular hydrogen gas (H2) — every morning. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of his other tips include always eating protein first “as it helps slow down carbohydrate absorption, which results in control of insulin and glucose levels.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But most importantly? “Follow this diet to the letter,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dark, leafy greens contain chlorophyll, which can help reduce redness and inflammation, as well as fight acne and eczema. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;noirchocolate – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;       &lt;strong&gt;THE 3-DAY NUTRITIONAL DIET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;                                                                                          &lt;strong&gt;BREAKFAST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2-egg omelet or 4 to 6 ounces grilled, baked or poached salmon&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(Perricone does not recommend smoked salmon on the 3-day diet because of the high salt content. Otherwise, smoked salmon is fine.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2-inch slice of cantaloupe or ¹∕&lt;sub&gt;³ &lt;/sub&gt;cup fresh berries&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;6 to 8 ounces spring water (feel free to squeeze fresh lemon into the water if desired)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No juice, coffee or toast&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you normally have coffee to start your day, drink black or green tea to prevent caffeine withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;                                                                                                  &lt;strong&gt;LUNCH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;4 to 6 ounces grilled, baked or poached poultry&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2 cups green salad, made with romaine lettuce and other dark, leafy greens such as spinach, arugula and kale. Top with 3 tablespoons cooked chickpeas. (Canned chickpeas are fine as long as you drain them.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Extra-virgin olive oil dressing, with fresh-squeezed lemon to taste&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;1 apple or 1 pear or 2-inch slice cantaloupe or ¹∕&lt;sub&gt;³ &lt;/sub&gt;cup berries and 6 to 8 ounces spring water&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;                                                                                                  &lt;strong&gt;DINNER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;4 to 6 ounces freshly cooked — grilled, broiled or poached — salmon on 1 cup of warmed lentils&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Green salad (as described above)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;½ cup steamed vegetables, especially asparagus, broccoli and spinach (avoid root vegetables like potatoes, carrots, beets and parsnips)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2-inch slice cantaloupe&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;6 to 8 ounces spring water&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you follow this diet for three days to the letter, be ready for a great improvement in how you look and feel.&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I remember someone in the community talking about their child who had been ‘vaccine injured’,” Johnson recalls. “It sparked a fear in me.” The science of vaccinations and immunization schedules also seemed impenetrable. “I was very conflicted, and felt like: ‘I don’t know any of this stuff, I didn’t go to school for this,’” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;She wondered whether vaccinating her daughter had been a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Johnson joined “crunchy” Facebook groups full of moms concerned about potentially harmful substances affecting their children, and started taking advice from a trusted anti-vax family member who seemed particularly credible because she was a nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;With her next three children, Johnson chose not to vaccinate. This left them vulnerable to infections with high infant-mortality rates, like invasive pneumococcal disease, Haemophilus influenzae and whooping cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“I felt I had done the quote-unquote research,” says Johnson. She read sources she thought were rational, like Suzanne Humphries and Roman Bystrianyk’s book Dissolving Illusions, which perpetuates the &lt;a href="https://vaccinarsinsardegna.org/en/science-knowledge/countering-disinformation/improved-hygiene-conditions-are-no-substitute-for-vaccinations" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;myth&lt;/a&gt; that hygiene, not vaccines, is primarily responsible for the decline of infectious diseases. She and her anti-vax community were convinced the medical system was corrupt, profiting from the distribution of unsafe, unnecessary vaccines. To them, not vaccinating their children was the hard but righteous thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Johnson soon began sharing what she had learned with others. “I had a decent following online. People were coming to me and listening to what I was sharing on the internet,” says Johnson, who remembers feeling a kind of “dopamine rush” when talking to other moms about vaccine “risks”. “I know that I led people down a path that now I totally regret,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;I know that I led people down a path that now I totally regret&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Nikki Hill Johnson, former anti-vaxxer&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Around 2020, Johnson’s perspective shifted abruptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;She started feeling like her MLM job was rigged: “I was having a lot of success, and then I wasn’t. I started watching some anti-MLM content and realizing that everything I knew was just part of a lie,” says Johnson. “Then I watched my family member who I trusted fall deep into the QAnon rabbit hole. I just felt that was too ridiculous ... Like, I can’t really trust her judgment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="9b3fe76b-6be5-4299-b84c-acb6352db0d9" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":11,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"How I escaped the wild west of #cleaneating Instagram and TikTok","elementId":"9b3fe76b-6be5-4299-b84c-acb6352db0d9","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/dec/16/food-nutrition-misinformation-social-media"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Johnson learned how misinformation spreads on social media, and re-evaluated the wellness content she had been consuming. She also started listening to more online influencers who had expertise in epidemiology and public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Johnson changed her stance on vaccines, dubious wellness trends and diet culture. She was “exiled” from her mom groups but didn’t really mind. She asked her pediatrician to help catch her children up on vaccines as quickly as possible. “[Pediatricians] realize that people have gotten into this anti-vaccine rhetoric,” Johnson says. “They work with you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Today, Johnson has relinquished the anti-vax myths that once shaped her life and identity. For experts and activists, such stories offer a glimmer of hope. As vaccine skepticism grows in the US and whole communities become more vulnerable to preventable diseases, is it possible to break through the noise and get people the healthcare they need?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-anti-vax-sentiment-is-growing-in-the-us" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Why anti-vax sentiment is growing in the US&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The anti-vax movement first &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1181850/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;emerged&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-19th century in response to mandatory smallpox-vaccination laws. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, anti-vax activism was increasingly tied to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9981160/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rightwing politics&lt;/a&gt;, framed around fears of government overreach and threats to personal freedom. In recent years, fueled by distrust of medical institutions, Covid-19-related anxieties and social media misinformation, the shift has accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While vaccines may carry temporary side effects like soreness and fever, as well as the rare possibility of certain more serious risks like allergic reactions, no credible scientists who study infectious disease and epidemiology think that vaccines are remotely nearly as dangerous as the diseases they prevent, says Dr Joe Pierre, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California at San Francisco, and author of &lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/false-9780197765272" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;False&lt;/a&gt;.

Vaccination levels in children have fallen below the herd-immunity threshold for many preventable diseases, including &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/202/5/655/1745591?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;mumps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;whooping cough&lt;/a&gt; (which killed &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/whooping-cough-deaths-us-most-since-2017/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;at least a dozen&lt;/a&gt; people in the US last year) and measles, the latter of which is now infecting &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/measles-outbreak-2024-why-measles-back-us-and-fda-approved-otc-birth" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; Americans than it has in decades and surged &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02603-5/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;20%&lt;/a&gt; globally in 2023.

She felt “kind of embarrassed”, Greene recalls, like just a panicky new mom making a big deal out of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Still worried, Greene went online. In a motherhood forum, she read about a frightening but &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6265562/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;false&lt;/a&gt; theory that babies lack a blood-brain barrier, making them vulnerable to brain injury from vaccines. “I found people saying: ‘They’re never going to admit it’s a vaccine side effect, but [your baby’s] brain is probably inflamed, she’s probably in pain,’” says Greene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Greene remembers a rising sense of panic and a distinct fear: “‘Something’s wrong with my kid.’” Subsequently, she decided not to vaccinate her next two children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"d2d2e910-ce74-45ae-a78e-faa4fe6998d7","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="d2d2e910-ce74-45ae-a78e-faa4fe6998d7" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Her awakening came at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, when she observed her anti-vax community “shunning the things they said prevented disease, like hygiene and masking”. To her, that seemed like “contrarianism, not critical thinking”.

Conspiratorial excesses are unlikely to alienate every believer. “On the contrary, cognitive dissonance, the tension that arises when our beliefs butt up against reality, is typically resolved by digging our heels in even deeper,” says Pierre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-importance-of-real-life-stories-in-changing-beliefs" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;The importance of real-life stories in changing beliefs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Still, some &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy-can-be-overcome-through-relatable-stories-and-accessible-information-169221" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; believe personal stories, like Johnson’s and Greene’s, are more persuasive than facts alone. To convince vaccine deniers, “scientific facts should be contextualized and made relatable to be understood as elements of a human experience”, write the authors of one 2021 report. &lt;a href="https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/why-vaccinate/personal-stories/?_gl=1*5x0fck*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTU5NzA5MTUyNi4xNzM4ODYzNjkw*_ga_CEHFEY8NBB*MTczODg2MzY4OS4xLjAuMTczODg2MzY4OS4wLjAuMA.." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Vaccine advocacy groups&lt;/a&gt; often feature personal stories as part of their education materials to convey the risks of preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Stories reveal the ways anti-vax ideology can cause harm, whether by increasing the risk of illness or distorting how children understand the world. Violet Adams, 32 (her name has been changed for her privacy), says that when she was growing up in British Columbia, her parents’ fear of vaccines instilled terror. “It’s very traumatizing as a child to hear things like: ‘The world is run by this evil, shadowy cabal,’” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;At university, she saw firsthand that the science professors were “not brainwashed, not sheep” - and her beliefs began to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;To the general public, many vaccine-preventable diseases – say, polio or smallpox – can seem like relics of the distant past; people are not always familiar with their effects. Greene argues that public messaging should depict the consequences of vaccine-preventable diseases, saying: “[People] need to know what diphtheria looks like, how it closes off your airway until you suffocate and die.” Washington state’s former secretary of health Dr Umair Shah has &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/21/covid-vaccines-science-2024-election-00116520" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it may take the death of an influential figure to a vaccine-preventable disease to bring back wider acceptance of immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="cc631ad0-d06b-4128-ba8e-4bb530597b2f" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Dr Harry Seanor of Willard Parker hospital with polio survivor Mark Fresco, age eight, wearing a newer ‘Monaghan’ 1lb iron lung, and Ann Bohrer in an older-model lung, in New York on 22 June 1949.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Bettmann Archive&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Firsthand experience with vaccine-preventable diseases can be a wake-up call. In 2015, formerly anti-vax mother Kristen O’Meara watched all three of her children suffer through severe cases of rotavirus. “It was awful, and it didn’t have to happen, because I could have had them vaccinated. I felt guilty. I felt really guilty,” she later said in an &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/anti-vaxxer-mom-mind-kids-fall-ill/story?id=42351543" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;. The experience led her to reconsider her stance and vaccinate her children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Additionally, institutions “have to work on how to present the truth in ways that are psychologically appealing”, says Pierre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Conspiracy beliefs can be fueled by psychological needs like uniqueness, a sense of control and social affiliation, says Pierre. Crusading for the truth is a powerful feeling; think of Johnson’s “dopamine rush”. Greene has found meaning in helping others via vaccine advocacy – a different way to satisfy those needs. She is now a nurse and co-founder of &lt;a href="https://backtothevax.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Back to the Vax&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that connects previously vaccine-hesitant parents, and a representative for the organization &lt;a href="https://www.voicesforvaccines.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Voices for Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-information-and-support-can-help" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;How information and support can help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Devon Greyson, a health information scientist, has studied mothers who changed their minds about vaccines in an effort to “reverse engineer” the process, they say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In a 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667321522000221#sec4" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, Greyson interviewed 23 mothers in Vancouver, Canada, whose vaccine attitudes evolved over time, whether more in favor of vaccines or further against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Mothers who became more confident in vaccines described their shift as a cognitive journey “toward facts and away from fear”, guided by trustworthy health authorities and real-world experience, says Greyson. They benefited from non-judgmental support, opportunities to ask healthcare providers questions and the reassurance of seeing with their own eyes that vaccines didn’t harm their children. Greyson suggests this framework could be useful in communicating with vaccine-hesitant individuals: instead of simply telling them to “trust science”, encourage them to think scientifically – to ask questions of trusted experts, identify reliable sources and remain intellectually flexible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;If I’m susceptible, anybody can be susceptible&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Nikki Hill Johnson, former anti-vaxxer&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;By contrast, mothers who became more skeptical described their experience as a descent into fear and anxiety, often triggered by dismissive healthcare encounters. Feeling brushed off by doctors left them seeking answers elsewhere, like online communities that stoked their doubts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="753b2c6e-8187-4b0a-8b66-7f384014e5df" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":53,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Are you falling for wellness misinformation online?

Still, even small efforts to build trust, such as referring patients to reliable information and support, are “so important” in helping families make informed choices, says Martin, whose research focuses on Black Americans’ experiences in the healthcare system, including vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7908879/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that “&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00027162221087936" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;prebunking&lt;/a&gt;”, or proactively warning people about vaccine conspiracies, is a promising approach. Resources like the &lt;a href="https://jitsuvax.info/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Jitsuvax project&lt;/a&gt;, co-created by psychologists, epidemiologists, behavioral scientists and clinicians from seven universities to combat misinformation, can help inoculate people against &lt;a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/explainers/anti-vaccine-conspiracies/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;particular conspiracies&lt;/a&gt; before they stumble upon them online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There’s no guaranteed way to snap someone out of anti-vax beliefs. But what helps is early, empathetic support from community and healthcare providers, and making space for people to change their minds as they embrace facts and critical thinking. Johnson, Adams and Greene changed their views not because they were debated into submission, but because they were open, flexible and secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Johnson is raising her kids with a solid foundation in scientific thinking. “I’m trying so hard to teach my kids critical-thinking skills,” Johnson says. “I feel like I’m a fairly smart person, and if I’m susceptible, anybody can be susceptible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 17:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPWjV4OTBfTUJ6V0k4RU1Qa3B5WTB0amRHWDNTTGhFQXRObHZKX1B3b0c0MXdCa2VSc25tSW5WWUtnR1Q3d1QzVkdqejhkeUV5aEU2RjJiZzVKSzdDajlqLTAzSkZWQjEwS1kzTXBJSHB6eFMyeUhtZm5lT2pmSlFYaTlBNUNtN29vVzRXZDF4Qms</guid></item><item><title>Measles cases reported in New Jersey, Kentucky amid ongoing outbreak in Texas - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPanRpQ0JGeTYxbEFQdUlvZE54M0kyelJ4ZzUxMkk5UC1jUkxWQk5yc1pLanA4dldMN1ZYYnNia2t3TVNQUkotMTA5Q3VLR2c1cEtlVkx4eU1Qa0JiXzA0cmc3TnlqOEppU1pwT3JxRDJPRV84dVVTaFZXUy1fUGt4Q1BXVnhVb0hralg2bVZpczRrcFNrZWxZR2Iwdk5qb2c4WU13N1l0OFnSAa4BQVVfeXFMT2VQR2FQTjVOUm1nMksta3pGTG5RakRIUVNSWUtoaGstREFvZUFQY1hwV0VPRVBZMUdzQnJvTWU3X0REMnFqMl9TN0cxZ21kbmU1aFo0V1MxTFI4WXQ2b3AyUG9DaU1rZGpUUm5qbm96LXRqb0RLaldYeU1SaWdmZzdSdkVXaWNEX2dLaXdVTUtFNmo5N3BiNGp1LUJKVklNOWtLejFfcEU2UmIxOVJB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;More measles cases are being confirmed across the United States as health officials work to treat patients in an ongoing outbreak in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Kentucky Department for Public Health (KDPH) and the Franklin County Health Department &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.chfs.ky.gov/News/Documents/Health%20Officials%20Announce%20Measles%20Case%20in%20Kentucky.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday a confirmed case of measles in an adult resident, the first in the state in two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The departments said the resident recently traveled internationally to an area where measles is spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, in New Jersey, health officials &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nj.gov/health/cd/topics/measles.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;confirmed two new measles cases&lt;/a&gt; in Bergen County linked to a patient whose case was confirmed earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Officials haven't found any links between the cases in Kentucky and New Jersey, and there's no evidence the cases in Kentucky or New Jersey are connected to the outbreak in Texas, which has so far sickened 124 people and led to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/1st-measles-death-linked-outbreak-texas-confirmed-child/story?id=119208967" target="_blank"&gt;one death in an unvaccinated school-aged child&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Kentucky health officials are now attempting to contact anyone the infected resident may have come into contact with.

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;No new date was set for a meeting and scientists warned that the cancellation risked undermining the development of flu vaccines for next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The committee was due to discuss the development of appropriate vaccine for combatting expected prevalent influenza strains next year, using data provided by the World &lt;a

that the meeting, which is held in late February or late March every year, was to be called off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We’re all left trying to understand what is going on. Why was this meeting cancelled? It’s an important meeting. What’s the plan for flu vaccines this year,” Paul Offit, a committee member and director of the vaccine education centre at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-cancels-flu-vaccine-meeting/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;told CBS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The cancellation followed the postponement of another &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC advisers panel&lt;/a&gt; on immunisation practices last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Scientists say it takes about six months to produce vaccines that fit the anticipated flu strains. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/flu" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Flu&lt;/a&gt; vaccines are generally rolled out in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="04bc0583-6d33-44fd-8160-825e8b005607" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":9,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Food head at FDA quits citing Trump administration’s mass staff cuts","elementId":"04bc0583-6d33-44fd-8160-825e8b005607","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/18/fda-food-head-quits-trump"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Some 86 children and 19,000 adults have died from flu in the US this year, according to CDC figures, while 430,000 people have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kennedy, who has drawn widespread criticism for his vaccine-sceptic views, has complained of “regulatory capture”, alleging that panels regulating drugs and vaccines are captive to the pharmaceutical industry. He has pledged to root out what he sees as conflicts of interests on government advisory panels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;He has singled out Offit, who invented a rotavirus vaccine that was later developed by the pharmaceutical company Merck and subsequently given FDA approval.

	The Food and Drug Administration abruptly canceled a critical meeting of the &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/vaccines/" id="auto-tag_vaccines" data-tag="vaccines"&gt;Vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), which gathers annually in March to determine what flu strains will be covered by next year’s vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The sudden cancellation of the meeting comes amid anxiety at federal health agencies over the future of vaccine programs under the Trump administration, and the stewardship of Health Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" id="auto-tag_robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-tag="robert-f-kennedy-jr"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	VRBPAC member Dr. Paul Offit &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/26/fda-cancels-vaccine-advisory-meeting-for-choosing-flu-shots.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;told CNBC&lt;/a&gt; that the meeting was canceled with little explanation on Wednesday afternoon. “Who canceled this meeting? Why did they cancel the meeting? Will manufacturers now turn to the World Health Organization to determine strains for this year’s influenza vaccines?” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“It’s a six-month production cycle,” Dr. Offit added in a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/politics/fda-flu-vaccine.html?unlocked_article_code=1.0E4.l6dr.jr6o_ECCpyi6&amp;amp;smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;amp;referringSource=articleShare" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;separate interview&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. “So one can only assume that we’re not picking flu strains this year.”

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Earlier this month, a planned meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) — which included votes on key recommendations for the CDC’s influenza prevention programs — was also &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;abruptly “postponed.”&lt;/a&gt; No new date has been set. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The 2025 flu season has been particularly brutal. According to the Centers for Disease Control, there have been “at least 33 million illnesses, 430,000 hospitalizations, and 19,000 deaths from flu so far this season.” The current flu outbreak is the worst experienced by the nation &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/u-s-facing-most-intense-flu-season-in-at-least-15-years" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;in 15 years,&lt;/a&gt; according to the CDC, and preparation for next year’s flu season is critical. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Shortly after being sworn in, Kennedy used his first address to staff at the Department of Health and Human Services to &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5153260-new-commission-maha-childhood-vaccine-schedule/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;inform them&lt;/a&gt; that they would be reviewing and investigating subjects that were “formally taboo or insufficiently scrutinized” and that “nothing is going to be off limits,” including “childhood vaccine schedule, electromagnetic radiation, glyphosate, other pesticides, ultra-processed foods, artificial food allergies, SSRI [antidepressants] and other psychiatric drugs, PFAS, PFOA, microplastics.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Earlier this month, Kennedy began making preparations to gut members of vaccine advisory committees — including VRBPAC — who he considered to have conflicts of interest, according to a report &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	On Wednesday, Kennedy drew public condemnation after &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-jr-measles-outbreak-texas-vaccines-1235281134/"&gt;downplaying the severity&lt;/a&gt; of a measles outbreak in Texas that has killed at least one child — the first measles related death in the U.S. since 2015. When asked about the outbreak during a Cabinet meeting, Kennedy claimed that “it’s not unusual to have measles outbreaks every year.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Between influenza and the measles, two unusually severe viral outbreaks are currently ravaging the United States — and Kennedy appears wholly unqualified to deal with them.&lt;/p&gt;

            A March meeting of outside advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration to discuss the composition of flu vaccines for this fall’s flu season has been canceled, a member of the advisory committee told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7mj0vt000063b6m1fevb0f3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The meeting of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBPAC, is held every March “to pick flu strains, because it’s a six-month production cycle for a vaccine released in September,” Dr. Paul Offit, a member of VRBPAC, told CNN Wednesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7mj0vt000073b6mm8z0f1iw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He said this year’s meeting had been set for March 13, and he received an email Wednesday afternoon saying it had been canceled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7mj0vt000083b6m2vnth7p6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “No indication it’s been postponed,” he told CNN; “cancelled.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7mj0vt000093b6m94sg0hue@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He said it wasn’t clear who directed the meeting to be cancelled or why, and said it’s also not clear now how flu vaccine manufacturers will get guidance on the composition of seasonal flu vaccines - “relying on WHO recommendations? What’s the plan?” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nfxht700003b6mscmjcrew@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The FDA confirmed the cancellation in a statement sent to CNN on Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7mj0vt0000a3b6mdev7ie16@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A planned March 13 meeting of the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee on the influenza vaccine strains for the 2025-2026 influenza season in the northern hemisphere has been cancelled,” the agency said. “The FDA will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nfxshu00023b6m5s3l01dc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A meeting of CDC’s vaccine advisers, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, scheduled to take place this week had already been postponed. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/agenda-2025-02-26-28-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;draft agenda&lt;/a&gt; included discussions and votes on flu shots and flu shots for the Vaccines for Children program, which provides vaccines for children whose parents and guardians may not be able to afford them.

Green&lt;/a&gt;, MD, &lt;em&gt;Chief of the&lt;/em&gt; Division of Neuroimmunology and Glial Biology, UCSF, and lead author on the study, told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work shows what appear to be multiple negative effects &lt;em&gt;for some people &lt;/em&gt;when their B12 levels are in the lower range of what has long been considered adequate or normal (and would not qualify as deficient). This includes slowed transmission of signals in the brain, slowed processing speed on cognitive tests and MRI evidence of white matter injury. Most importantly, these effects are strongest when looking at the ‘active’ fraction of B12 (which is not routinely checked) rather than just total blood B12 levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the scale, the researchers found that higher levels of B12 also had effects that may impact cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those people with higher B12 levels had increased levels of T-Tau protein, which is associated with neurodegeneration and dementia. This association was strongest when there were low levels of active B12 and high levels of holo-HC, or ‘inactive B12’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segil suggested that further research was needed to verify why the study might have found this. Green concurred:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We also saw that high levels of ‘inactive’ B12 in the blood may be associated with a blood marker of axon injury. It should be noted that we did not have a means of directly measuring inactive B12 levels in the paper but had to calculate the level from other measurements. The full meaning of this result needs further study but it suggests that measuring total blood B12 may mislead doctors and patients in some situations to think that active B12 levels are adequate.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe that recommendations for B12 should be very likely be reconsidered — and not just based on B12 blood levels but considering measures of active vs inactive B12 and looking at measures of neurological and cognitive function. Measuring what is adequate by just measuring what is average (and the distribution) in the population does not prove that the levels are adequate for any nutrients,” Green told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest that the observed detrimental effect of low B12 on cognitive processes may be caused by changes in the integrity of the myelin surrounding nerve cells. However, they emphasise that their study did not look into how these changes might occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they suggest that elderly people may be particularly vulnerable to declining levels of B12, so the guidelines for healthy B12 levels may need to be revised for this population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is lots of additional research that needs to be done. The reasons why inadequate B12 causes neurological dysfunction— specifically which cell types in the brain and which parts of the nervous system most require B12 — is completely unclear. This needs careful scientific and laboratory work which is currently going on in our laboratory and affiliated labs.”&lt;br&gt;— Ari J. Green, MD, lead author of the study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure adequate B12, people should include foods that are rich in the vitamin in their diet. Segil advised that salmon and beef are two of the best sources of B12. As plant foods do not contain B12, vegetarians and vegans might benefit from supplements to ensure healthy levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements" rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;NIH states&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; that even at large doses, vitamin B12 is generally considered to be safe because the body does not store excess amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Both kids and adults can get B12 deficiencies from absorption issues even if they eat a diet high in B12 products,” adding, “for the general public, I would recommend using a multivitamin with B12 in it rather than a B12 supplement, which can come in a liquid form, gel cap or regular tab,” Segil said.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 14:43:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiygFBVV95cUxNQVNrNm9UZGN4SFJUYnctUVBRT2VKYjFTMmVlUGpIdGhyS0RfUC1lSXRtbk5OcUtKNk9vdm9ld2F0MURMTmp1Y3FRNHBsQVQzNFBhTWt3R2dDbWVMTWlhbHlXNV9kckNHX2NpMkVYeXZWeG9qZi04Y3dfaGh6S29mMGR5dFZqUTJSNXJrUDlfVXZDX29PeU5wYlRoYnJ2MnNLcE1jR3FQRmh6MlpDUVFKRTNVQjBTLTJ3Q2o5cGJwZEU1dlNjQVl5aTB3</guid></item><item><title>LAX on red alert as foreign traveler brings in deadly disease and infects unknown number - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxNOFZ1TUloaDh5RFIxZmZUUUxnSl9BekVNWUdidkVVUmJwNkIyeVRMWGpaaS1fYi1uOTNkbHpCZ2JHUFVVek91ZWRMRDZNYS1VdVE5cTEzZmhyTlljR3hLZFdHQVJqWkVQUk5wc0tESFRtb3VOSGhQNnJXbExLRElSQ05GbDFFc1p2TGQ0VDUxeXhTSFVvTnBXN2E4Y1pUcmJs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials have warned of a potential measles outbreak at &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/los-angeles/index.html" id="mol-14f4d1e0-f512-11ef-afa6-c762aac65cd9"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; International airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A passenger arriving on a Korean Air flight from Seoul tested positive for the highly contagious respiratory illness, which is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14422449/Pediatrician-working-heart-Texas-measles-outbreak-warns-just-beginning-cases-surging-90.html"&gt;currently ripping its way through Texas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Travelers who were in LAX's Terminal B on February 19 during the hours of 1pm to 4pm have been warned that they could be at high risk of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The airport is working with the CDC to notify passengers on the flight who might have been close enough to the infected traveler to contract the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Passengers who fear they may have crossed paths with the patient have been advised to confirm if they have been vaccinated against measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn the US is currently vulnerable to measles outbreaks because of falling vaccination rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;America suffered its first fatality from the disease in a decade this week after the death of an unvaccinated child in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14429317/large-measles-outbreak-vaccinated-rfk.html"&gt;Measles is transmitted by direct contact &lt;/a&gt;with infectious droplets or by airborne spread when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Health officials have warned of a potential measles outbreak at Los Angeles International airport&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease causes tiny white spots inside the mouth, flat red spots on the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet, ear infections and an intense fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In extreme cases, measles can cause &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/pneumonia/index.html" id="mol-4796db20-f512-11ef-afa6-c762aac65cd9" class=""&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, encephalitis (swelling of the brain) and may lead to death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health says LAX passengers who have not been vaccinated 'are at risk of contracting measles if they have been exposed'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health experts say they should monitor for symptoms, with these generally developing 7 to 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;The CDC posted a bird flu update to the health agency’s website on Wednesday, the first since President Donald Trump took office. The report provides a snapshot of recent human cases of H5N1, including two people who were hospitalized after being infected by different means, bringing the national total to 70 cases and one death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new update, dated &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-02262025.html"&gt;Feb. 26&lt;/a&gt;, includes recently confirmed cases in Nevada, Ohio, and Wyoming. The Nevada case is the most mild of the recently confirmed cases and involved a dairy worker whose symptoms included conjunctivitis (eye redness and irritation). That worker was infected by the dairy cows they worked with and experienced only mild symptoms before recovering, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two more serious cases involve being infected by birds, though under very different conditions. The case in Ohio involves a commercial poultry farm worker who was engaging in the systematic slaughter of birds on a farm with infected poultry. The poultry farm worker experienced respiratory symptoms and what the health agency calls “severe illness” and was hospitalized. That worker is now at home and recovering, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case in Wyoming also involves someone infected by birds, but the poultry in this instance was the backyard variety. That person was infected by dead poultry on their property known to have died of bird flu. The Wyoming patient initially tested negative for influenza viruses when upper respiratory specimens were tested but another test was done after that person was hospitalized and a lower respiratory specimen collected several days after the first test were positive for H5N1.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case in Wyoming is someone who had “underlying health conditions that can make people more vulnerable to severe influenza illness,” according to the CDC, though it’s not entirely clear what that means. That kind of language was often used during the covid-19 pandemic to rationalize the over 1.2 million deaths experienced in the U.S. since 2020 as somehow acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The USDA reports over &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks"&gt;19 million birds&lt;/a&gt; are on the premises of farms and other properties that have been confirmed to have bird flu in the past 30 days, including 87 commercial flocks and 51 backyard flocks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last update on the CDC’s website before Feb. 26 was dated Jan. 17, a few days before President Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20. Trump has been dismantling the U.S. federal government along with his billionaire buddy Elon Musk under the auspices of DOGE, and CDC has been the victim of massive cuts, including &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/25/nx-s1-5307117/cdc-firings-infectious-disease-response"&gt;mass firings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;But the health agency currently notes that human-to-human spread still hasn’t been identified in any of the 70 cases confirmed and the risk to the general public is still considered low. Hopefully, it stays that way, as scientists worry that a mutation that would cause spread between humans would kick off a new pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2020, Sula published a piece in her mother's Perspective section arguing that 'clinicians and health care institutions' must 'confront their own transphobia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, researchers say their pieces with opposing views have been turned away. One researcher Dr Sapir spoke to, said their letter to the editor pointing out flaws in a pro-gender-affirming care Perspectives article was rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a piece for the City Journal , journalist Leor Sapir accuses New England Journal of Medicine editor Debra Malina of 'editorial bias' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They then wrote to NEJM's editorial board on February 2, 2023, suggesting that Malina should 'recuse herself from publication decisions involving topics that implicate her daughter's livelihood.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But NEJM's editor-in-chief, Eric Rubin, reportedly disagreed with the researcher's claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His response, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/new-england-journal-of-medicine-transgender-activists"&gt;published &lt;/a&gt;in Dr Sapir's opinion piece for the City Journal, reads: 'We encourage authors and reviewers to be transparent about financial conflicts and largely prohibit editors from having financial conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, all of our authors, reviewers and editors have opinions and biases (although I hope are willing to be proven wrong). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I do not consider pre-existing opinions without financial conflicts to be grounds for recusal whether for Perspectives or research articles.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Puberty blockers were originally developed to suppress the hormones of minors who started puberty too early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are nowadays prescribed to a fast-growing number of trans children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Advocates of gender-affirming care, as it is known, say it's life-saving for a suicide-prone group, and that puberty blockers help pre-teens 'pause' their puberty and buy time to weigh life-altering decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Critics warn of surging numbers of young people who identify as trans, and say puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgeries are often unnecessary and likely dangerous when counselling gets better results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since 2015, Dr Sapir says by his count, Perspective has published 26 articles supportive of 'gender-affirming' medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds: 'As far as I can tell, Perspective has not published a single article that is critical, or even skeptical, of the controversial practice.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Debra Malina has worked at the New England Journal of Medicine for more than 20 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Malina's daughter Sula started identifying as non-binary in college and currently works as a therapist in Brooklyn, New York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it appears he is not alone with his concerns about the direction of the NEJM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2021, Dr Colin Wright - who holds a PhD in evolutionary biology from the University of California - penned a piece for Genetic Literacy Project titled 'Viewpoint on sex and gender: Has the New England Journal abandoned science for woke political correctness?' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead of highlighting Malina as the prime cause for the journal's woke stance, Wright refers to the editorial team as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his piece, Dr Wright highlights a message the NEJM left on X supporting not assigning sex at birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The message read: 'Sex designations on birth certificates offer no clinical utility, and they can be harmful for intersex and transgender people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Moving such designations below the line of demarcation would not compromise the birth certificate's public health function but could avoid harm.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wright expressed distain towards the NEJM's stance, writing in response: 'The fact that editors at such a prestigious journal as NEJM have chosen to assign credence to these arguments leaves us no choice but to unpack them.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another piece published the same year in National Review, writer and academic Wesley Smith expressed his frustration around how the NEJM was training medical students to be 'woke social activists.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'There the NEJM goes pushing woke agendas again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This time, the extremely politically progressive medical journal has published an article urging that medical students be taught that left-wing social-justice engagement should be among their professional duties.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smith went on to accuse the journal of 'repeatedly' featuring articles that 'cut adamantly against social-conservative values.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DailyMail.com has reached out to the NEJM on this matter and is still awaiting comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 13:39:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Centenarians share their longevity formula: ‘Staying busy gives you purpose’ - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPLWZSSUpGTFJKZnBmNmZWRXl5V1h0X3VLUU5sS2o4X3d0RkZvM3o4dFVZNVRQWjlWRFV5aFpxUTlwbFdSTFNmQWNucTFpR3BpMFU1TWFLSlpsaFozSzBLdWxyTDd6X25XUHlXOTJ5MGpLOXZBQVF4VXh2VW9KUVFFWFI2WHlaNDVBR2o1RmYyLVM4LWpVWm1CZXowRQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LPMDPPBBDBBXNP4DTINH727NAQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;JoCleta Wilson’s alarm goes off at 4 a.m. She jumps out of bed, makes a pot of coffee and puts on her makeup.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus made its first appearance at a U.S. poultry farm in February 2022, roughly 29,000 turkeys at an Indiana facility were sacrificed in an attempt to avert a larger outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;It didn't work. Three years later, highly &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/pathogenic+avian+influenza/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pathogenic avian influenza&lt;/a&gt; has spread to all 50 states. The number of commercial birds that have died or been killed exceeds 166 million and the price of eggs is at an all-time high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poultry producers, infectious disease experts and government officials now concede that H5N1 is likely here to stay. That recognition is prompting some of them to question whether the long-standing practice of culling every single bird on an infected farm is sustainable over the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, they are discussing such strategies as targeted depopulation, vaccinations, and even the relocation of wetlands and bodies of water to lure virus-carrying wild birds away from poultry farms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But each of these alternatives entails a variety of logistical, economic and environmental costs that may eclipse the intended savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People talk about common-sense solutions to bird flu," said Dr. Maurice Pitesky, a veterinarian and commercial poultry expert at UC Davis. "But that's what mass culling is. There's a reason we've been doing it: It's common sense."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current version of the bird flu—known as H5N1 2.3.4.4b—is both highly contagious and highly lethal. It has plowed through the nation's commercial chickens, turkeys and ducks with a mortality rate of nearly 100%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There's a reason why they call it 'highly pathogenic avian influenza,'" said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Research Organization. "It just goes straight through a flock like a hot knife through butter."&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;And it's why most researchers and veterinarians promote mass culling, describing it as humane and cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A natural death from H5N1 is not pleasant for a chicken, said Rasmussen. The virus produces a gastrointestinal infection, so the birds wind up dying of diarrhea along with respiratory distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's like Ebola without the hemorrhage," she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sparing birds that don't look sick is a gamble. They may be infected and able to spread the virus through their poop before they have any outward signs of illness. The only way to know for sure is to test each bird individually—an expensive and time-consuming prospect. And if even a single infected bird is missed, it can spread the virus to an entire flock of replacements, Rasmussen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, she said, all of the extra work that would go into making sure some chickens can stay alive would only drive up labor costs and ultimately make eggs more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also has the potential to increase the total amount of virus on farms, which is dangerous for human poultry workers, said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One of the reasons to cull early is that you don't want a lot of bird-human exposures," he said. "The more infections we introduce to humans, the more mutations we're going to see that increase the risk of a broader epidemic or pandemic."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of these reasons, international trade agreements require mass culling—also known as "stamping out"—so that importers don't get a side of H5N1 with their poultry, said Dr. Carol Cardona, a veterinarian and avian influenza researcher at the University of Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;That's not the only financial incentive for mass culling. The USDA reimburses farmers for eggs and birds that have to be killed to contain an outbreak, but not for birds that die of the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet at times, this has meant killing more than 4.2 million birds, most of which may have been healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Mattos, president of the California Poultry Federation, said a more targeted approach could be feasible when all birds are not living under the same roof. In California, for instance, farms that raise broiler chickens typically operate multiple stand-alone buildings with separate ventilation systems, entryways and exits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biosecurity measures like these can keep pathogens from spreading between barns, Cardona said. Risks could be reduced further by requiring workers to change their clothes and boots when moving from barn to barn, or by assigning workers to a single barn, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But others, including Dr. John Korslund, a veterinarian and former USDA researcher, are skeptical that such a practice could work, considering the virulence of H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Chickens are infected and shedding virus very early, often before visible evidence of clinical illness," Korslund said. "Odds are that 'healthy' buildings on infected premises may be in reality in the early stages of incubating infections," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it was possible some buildings might remain virus-free, and some birds could be salvaged, the downsides of this approach are huge, Korsland said. "A lot of additional virus will be put into the environment," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Indeed, flu particles from one facility can escape exhaust fans and travel great distances, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Studies have shown that "the movement of virus from farm to farm was associated with wind direction and speed," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bird flu vaccines may offer some protection. Both China and France use them, and the USDA granted a conditional license this month for an H5N2 vaccine designed for chickens, according to Zoetis, the company that developed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some are heralding vaccines as a potential tool to inoculate the nation's poultry farms, others say the costs could be too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most U.S. trade partners are not keen to import poultry products from countries that vaccinate their birds due to concerns that the shots can mask the presence of the virus. And most will blackball a nation's entire poultry portfolio, even if just one region or type of poultry is infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. exports more than 6.7 billion pounds of chicken meat each year, second only to Brazil, according to the National Chicken Council. So as long as foreign buyers are resistant to vaccination, the shots probably won't be deployed even if egg-laying hens are getting wiped out by the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As members of the U.S. Congressional and Senate Chicken Caucuses wrote in a letter this month to the USDA, "if an egg-laying hen in Michigan is vaccinated for HPAI, the U.S. right now would likely be unable to export an unvaccinated broiler chicken from Mississippi."&lt;/p&gt;

																																			&lt;p&gt;The new H5N2 vaccine might allay such concerns. While it would offer protection against H5N1, it would elicit antibodies that look distinct from the ones that arise from an actual infection, Cardona said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pitesky said that none of these measures will work if we don't do a better job with flu surveillance and farm placement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wildlife and agriculture officials should ramp up their testing of wild birds to determine where the virus is moving and how it is evolving, he said. That will require global coordination because infected birds can travel back and forth between the U.S., Canada, Russia, East Asia and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poultry farms near ponds, lagoons or wetlands that attract wild birds should be on high alert during migration season, Pitesky said. Farmers should use apps such as eBird, BirdCast or the Waterfowl Alert Network to keep tabs on when the birds are nearby so they can step up their biosecurity measures as needed, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be possible to lure &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/wild+birds/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;wild birds&lt;/a&gt; away from agricultural facilities by bolstering wetlands in more remote areas, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I keep pushing the idea of starting to reflood some of those wetlands, but we haven't done it in any kind of strategic fashion," Pitesky said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea makes sense, but has been brushed off as "pie in the sky, which I push back on," he said. "I'm like, what we're doing right now is obviously not working."&lt;/p&gt;

In recent months, disease surveillance has identified increases in illness and deaths three times in different areas of the country, and triggered follow-up investigations to confirm the cause and provide needed support. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Since the beginning of 2025, a series of illnesses and community deaths have affected Equateur province. The most recent cluster occurred in the Basankusu health zone, where last week 141 additional people fell ill, with no deaths reported. In the same health zone, 158 cases and 58 deaths were reported in the same health zone earlier in February. In January, Bolamba health zone reported 12 people who fell ill including 8 deaths. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Increased disease surveillance has identified in total of 1096 sick people and 60 deaths in Basankusu and Bolomba fitting a broad case definition that includes fever, headache, chills, sweating, stiff neck, muscle aches, multiple joint pain and body aches, a runny or bleeding from nose, cough, vomiting and diarrhoea. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;The Democratic Republic of the Congo is facing many concurrent crises and outbreaks, putting a further strain on the health sector and the population.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;In response to the latest cluster of illness, a national rapid response team from Kinshasa and Equateur including WHO health emergency experts was deployed to Basankusu and Bolomba health zones to investigate the situation and determine if there is an unusual pattern. The experts are stepping up disease surveillance, conducting interviews with community members to understand the background, and providing treatment for diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;WHO has delivered emergency medical supplies, including testing kits, and developed detailed protocols to enhance disease investigation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Initial laboratory analysis has turned out negative for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus disease. Around half of the samples tested positive for malaria, which is common in the region. Further tests are to be carried out for meningitis. Food, water and environmental samples will also be analysed, to determine if there might be contamination. The various samples will be sent for further testing at the national reference laboratory in Kinshasa. Earlier samples turned out not to be viable and re-testing was undertaken. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Basankusu and Bolomba are about 180 kilometres apart and more than 300 kilometres from the provincial capital Mbandaka. The two localities are reachable by road or via the Congo River from Mbandaka. This remoteness limits access to health care, including testing and treatment. Poor road and telecommunication infrastructure are also major challenges.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;WHO is supporting the local health authorities reinforce investigation and response measures, with more than 80 community health workers trained to detect and report cases and deaths.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-GB"&gt;Further efforts are needed to reinforce testing, early case detection and reporting, for the current event but also for future incidents. WHO remains on the ground supporting health worker, collaborating closely with zonal, provincial and national health authorities to provide lifesaving medical supplies and to coordinate response to curb the spread of the illness and other outbreaks in the region. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

(EXTENDED) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop and implement a plan to expand access to optimized supportive clinical care for all patients with mpox, including children, patients living with HIV, and pregnant women. This includes prompt identification and effective management of endemic co-infections, such as malaria, chickenpox or measles. This also includes offering HIV tests to adult patients who do not know their HIV status and to children as appropriate, testing and treatment for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among cases linked to sexual contact and referral to HIV/STIs treatment and care services when indicated.

(EXTENDED, with re-phrasing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop and implement plans for vaccination in the context of an integrated response at the lowest administrative level reporting cases for people at high risk of exposure (e.g., contacts of cases of all ages, including sexual contacts, health and care workers, key populations, and other groups at risk in endemic and non-endemic areas). This entails a targeted integrated response, including active surveillance and contact tracing; agile adaptation of immunization strategies and plans to the local context including the availability of vaccines and supplies; proactive community engagement to generate and sustain demand for and trust in vaccination; close monitoring of mpox vaccination activities and coverage, and the collection of data during vaccination activities according to implementable research protocols. (EXTENDED, with re-phrasing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strengthen risk communication and community engagement systems with affected communities and local workforces for outbreak prevention, response and vaccination strategies, particularly at the lowest administrative levels reporting cases, including through training, mapping high risk and vulnerable populations, social listening and community feedback, and managing misinformation. This entails, inter alia, communicating effectively the uncertainties regarding the natural history of mpox, updated information about mpox including about the efficacy of mpox vaccines, the uncertainties regarding duration of protection following vaccination, and any relevant information about clinical trials to which the local population may have access, as appropriate. (EXTENDED, with re-phrasing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Address stigma and discrimination of any kind via meaningful community engagement, particularly in health services and during risk communication activities. (EXTENDED)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Promote and implement IPC measures and basic WASH and waste management services in household settings, congregate settings (e.g. prisons, internally displaced persons and refugee camps, etc.), schools, points of entry and cross border transit areas. (EXTENDED)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governance and financing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Galvanize and scale up national funding and explore external opportunities for targeted funding of mpox prevention, readiness and response activities, advocate for release of available funds and take steps to identify potential new funding partners for emergency response. (EXTENDED, with re-phrasing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Integrate mpox prevention and response measures, including enhanced surveillance, in existing programmes for prevention, control and treatment of other endemic diseases – especially HIV, as well as STIs, malaria, tuberculosis, other vaccine-preventable diseases including COVID-19, and/or non-communicable diseases – striving to identify activities which will benefit the programmes involved and lead to better health outcomes overall. (EXTENDED, with re-phrasing)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addressing research gaps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;span&gt;Invest in field studies to better understand animal hosts and zoonotic spillover in the areas where MPXV is circulating, in coordination with the animal health sector and One Health partners. (EXTENDED, with re-phrasing)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strengthen and expand use of genomic sequencing to characterize the epidemiology and chains of transmission of MPXV to better inform control measures. (EXTENDED)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reporting on the implementation of temporary recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report quarterly to WHO on the status of, and challenges related to, the implementation of these temporary recommendations, using a standardized tool and channels that will be made available by WHO.

However, Dr. Lewis noted there have been two confirmed measles exposures in the state this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"None of those exposures ended in disease, and that’s likely due to prior immunity," he said. "If a person is fully vaccinated against measles, that’s two doses of them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/unvaccinated-child-dies-of-measles-texas-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-deadly-illness-rfk-jr-department-state-health-services" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/unvaccinated-child-dies-of-measles-texas-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-deadly-illness-rfk-jr-department-state-health-services" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Texas child who was not vaccinated has died of measles, a 1st for the US in a decade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents in the area are expressing their concerns about the disease. David Schoen, a parent, said, "It’s low risk, high reward, keeping your kids' eyesight and health. It’s not worth it to go your own way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC reports that an estimated 91.3% of children in Washington state were vaccinated for the 2023-2024 school year. However, some parents, like Christopher J. Zarati, are less worried. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If something was to happen, I mean, there’s nothing I can really do about it," Zarati said. "Vaccines are not 100%. I mean, that’s with every vaccine, so unfortunately, if it happens, it happens."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials continue to monitor for any measles outbreaks and emphasize that vaccination remains the best protection. "It’s never too late to get it," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO SEE: &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/snohomish-county-health-department-confirmed-measles-case-seattle-tacoma-international-airport-exposure-symptoms-king-county-public-health-schd" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/local/snohomish-county-health-department-confirmed-measles-case-seattle-tacoma-international-airport-exposure-symptoms-king-county-public-health-schd" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;2 cases of measles exposure confirmed in Snohomish County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DOH also says the MMR vaccine is our best defense against measles. MMR vaccination coverage rates for children dropped during the pandemic and have not recovered. In 2023, only about 75% of children aged 19-35 months in Washington were up to date on their MMR vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some data from Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County say an estimated 87% of 2-year-olds in King County have received one dose of the MMR vaccine. Young children are at risk of severe disease from measles, and receiving one dose of MMR can provide crucial protection from complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They add that 72% of 4-6-year-olds in King County have received two or more doses of MMR. Children are eligible for a second dose of MMR at 4 years old, and parents should be encouraged to get the second dose as soon as possible instead of waiting until they are enrolled in school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO News</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 09:36:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAJBVV95cUxQaEd0VVJTMjFoT1pnQ3pKTmNweFI4b2NqbzhwSG56YzQtRzFOaEFQOHZWc1ZxWHVpSEFlbThwY0VBSzZtQi1tRUZnVElCTmt5aDFZenVHRDVGV0N6N1ZzTmxjaHdBYTBudlU2VEQ4OHR2MEIwNUxWandwZ1dRTHB1dm82TXQ0VFhFZDdPY0FBbkRpb2NscVpBcEdTa2gwNlI5YXVGSEdDNEhYd0dwdHMwa3l0UWsyOUV1NUtXSHRqS1E3Z2RzampoMGxPSW9scjBnalJ1UHFBcDhKZGZ4dTRheHVkdlVPdjBPamN2WGRBV0huYU0xQzFZT1h2RDd4OHZC</guid></item><item><title>Study Reveals How Much Exercise Older Adults Need Each Week To Live Longer - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNR3o2cV9SVVl5Wm9uM1BzUF8xTm1Rbkc4dnhLcVFaQUQ5SGlPREkta2ZBRFpPUGRCZkhmbnZDSXMyeWhwS01WUmNGMFFuNV8wMVdlVllsTHBIVF9jejFqSXZTVjJVNWp0OTJmLWhpQkpmUXpJMkk3NjAycVc5WnI2SDNTeVgxVWdfRWhnZWpJVTVVX285WjN3VFhn0gGfAUFVX3lxTE96eHNrWmtUV0ZpUXYyWjJaX0ZvMHZ3NW9rTDdudlRLQS1FRFJTYVhmSXJCVktEWGExeFJlaVNqdUNYQ1FnTkZORE1TWkkzOUNEOGdyTE40V29FSnNCb0N4QzB5M0pZeG81UHAtajR3UzBLaDRhS0x2a2pjMk5NaEdhOVczbTVtWnRrbjdnaHdXZjBIWGV3YlJuTnBJc0RDYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is important for everyone, no matter your age.

The authors found that not exercising is a risk factor for 30 chronic conditions, such as heart failure, diabetes, dementia, osteoporosis, dementia, depression and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;By committing to 150-minutes of exercise each week, older adults can cut their risk of developing these conditions or slow down their progression if they do get diagnosed, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does an adequate amount of exercise help with general longevity and disease prevention, researchers found that by doing regular exercise, older adults are more able to perform necessary tasks that keep them functionally independent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a statistic in this paper that said in 2014 ... one out of three older adults in the U.S. fall in any given year,” said &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/phillip-yun" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Phillip Yun" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67bb45e5e4b0249e5d5af0ff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/find-a-physician/physician/phillip-yun" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. Phillip Yun&lt;/a&gt;, a primary care sports medicine physician at UChicago Medicine. (Yun was not affiliated with the study.) A fall for someone who is young and healthy may not be a big deal, but for an older adult who may have less muscle strength or brittle bones, it can be hugely detrimental and lead to surgery, rehabilitation and a host of issues down the road.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of complications that can be associated with something as innocuous as a simple fall,” Yun explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise can help improve your balance, so you’re less likely to fall altogether, and can also bolster your bone and muscle health, so if you do fall, you’re less likely to get seriously hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found that exercise can benefit your cognition. Exercise in older adults was found to lessen the chance of developing cognitive impairment and could help prevent Alzheimer’s disease as well. It’s also good for mental health and mood, and can help lessen the likelihood of depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the difference between moderate-intensity aerobic exercise and vigorous exercise?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/measuring/index.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="moderate aerobic physical activity includes" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67bb45e5e4b0249e5d5af0ff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/measuring/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;moderate aerobic physical activity includes&lt;/a&gt; exercises like brisk walking, dancing, gardening and playing doubles tennis, but Yun said exactly what is moderate and what is vigorous varies from person to person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good way to tell if you’re doing moderate aerobic physical activity is to try the “talk test” as you exercise. “The talk test basically is you’re not able to sing, but you’re still able to talk and complete sentences and have a full conversation — that is moderate aerobic physical activity,” Yun explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way to measure your exercise intensity? Quantifying it. With moderate activity, you should feel like you’re exercising at a 5 or 6 on a 1 to 10 scale, Yun added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: andreswd via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;andreswd via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Walking can be a great moderate-intensity exercise to jump start your workout habit.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can you add moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity to your routine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You shouldn’t try to get in all 150 minutes of weekly exercise in one day. Instead, you should break that up into at least three days each week, Yun said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty minutes of exercise at a time is generally a good place for folks, he noted. But if you’re just entering your workout era, you could start with something small like a 10-minute walk twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I generally recommend for most people to start off with &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/topic/walking" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="walking" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67bb45e5e4b0249e5d5af0ff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/topic/walking" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; because it has a low barrier of entry, and I think it’s something that you can often do on your own or with people,” Yun said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If walking isn’t for you, Yun recommended you find something that you enjoy doing. This way, you’ll be more likely to continue the exercise as time goes on. That could be gardening, cycling with friends or taking up a dance class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;Go Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next four years will change America forever.
