    &lt;p&gt;Two people have died from eating raw oysters that were contaminated with a flesh-eating bacteria, Louisiana health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibrio vulnificus is a bacteria that occurs in warm coastal waters. It is more common between May and October. The bacteria can cause illness when an open wound is exposed to contaminated waters, or when a person eats raw or undercooked seafood. Oysters are particularly risky, state health officials &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/vibrio-vulnificus-2025" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;said in a July news release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria can cause life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis, which may result in limb amputation, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. About one in five people with a Vibrio vulnificus infection die, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been 22 cases of Vibrio vulnificus infection in Louisiana residents, the state department of health said. All of the victims were hospitalized. Four people have died, the health department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the deaths were among people who had eaten raw Louisiana oysters. The other two deaths were among people who reported exposing an open wound to seawater. None of the victims have been identified. One of the victims who ate contaminated oysters was a Louisiana resident. The other lived out of state, the health department said. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisiana has been seeing a higher number of Vibrio vulnificus infections and deaths, the state's health department said. During the past 10 years, the state has seen an average of seven infections and one death per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk of the bacteria is rising due to &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flesh-eating-bacteria-vibrio-vulnificus-florida/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;warming oceans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Earlier this mont, Florida confirmed 13 cases of Vibrio vulnificus across 11 counties. Eight victims died, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/report-13-cases-of-flesh-eating-bacteria-eight-deaths-confirmed-in-florida/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;CBS Miami reported&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Cases of the bacteria have been reported recently as far north as &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/flesh-eating-bacteria-vibrio-vulnificus-falmouth/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Connecticut and New York. &lt;/p&gt;

Literally everywhere. I was also beset with uncontrolled shivering all during my show," he said. "Initially, I thought it was just muscle cramps and aches.

Malaria can be deadly if left unchecked."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While he was absent, Trace Gallagher filled in for him on Fox News, and Roberts took to social media to give thanks. "Thank you to Trace for jumping into the chair today! I somehow came down with a severe case of Malaria," he wrote. "I can honestly say that I am the only person in the hospital with Malaria.

It examined the proportion of people in those couples who had one of nine psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), substance-use disorder and anorexia nervosa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists lack a definitive understanding of what causes people to develop psychiatric disorders — but genetics and environmental factors are both thought to play a part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that when one partner was diagnosed with one of the nine conditions, the other was significantly more likely to be diagnosed with the same or another psychiatric condition. Spouses were more likely to have the same conditions than to have different ones, says co-author Chun Chieh Fan, a population and genetics researcher at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research in Tulsa, Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main result is that the pattern holds across countries, across cultures, and, of course, generations,” Fan says. Even changes in psychiatric care over the past 50 years have not shifted the trend, he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only OCD, bipolar disorder and anorexia nervosa showed different patterns across countries. For instance, in Taiwan, married couples were more likely to share OCD than were couples in Nordic countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study separated people into birth cohorts, from the 1930s to the 1990s, spanning ten-year intervals. For most disorders, the chances of partners sharing a diagnosis increased slightly with each decade, particularly for those with disorders related to substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s behind the trend?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study did not investigate what causes the phenomenon, Fan says three theories could help to explain it. First, people might be attracted to those who resemble them. “Perhaps they better understand each other due to shared suffering, so they attract each other,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, a shared environment could make partners more alike — a process known as convergence. And third, the societal stigma of having a psychiatric disorder narrows a person’s choice of spouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan Fullerton, a psychiatric geneticist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, says that social and environmental stressors could contribute to a new diagnosis in a previously unaffected partner, particularly if they had milder, undiagnosed symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Treating &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/10k-steps-a-day-walking-b2735565.html"&gt;10,000 steps per day&lt;/a&gt; as the gold standard for a healthy lifestyle is far more contentious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number stems from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer called the Manpo-Kei, or “10,000 steps metre”. It’s a nice round number, but it’s not one identified by science as the holy grail for health – a 2023 study by the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ugr.es/en/about/news/how-many-steps-take-each-day-reduce-risk-premature-death8000"&gt;University of Granada&lt;/a&gt; suggests that, while more is better, 8,000 is sufficient “to significantly reduce the risk of premature death”​​. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/walking"&gt;Walking&lt;/a&gt; 10,000 steps also takes a fair old while. Even at a decent nick, this task is likely to take you upwards of 90 minutes each day, making it a struggle for busy folks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-31azim-0 eBMXOi nextSwipeIgnore"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU sc-wlmftc-0 ccDPKb"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-hKDTPf hmBpZX"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7Ehvq-bm6I"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, an alternative walking protocol – colloquially termed “Japanese walking” due to its country of origin – has stepped into the spotlight online. It takes just 30 minutes per day, with fitness coach and content creator &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/coacheugeneteo/?hl=en"&gt;Eugene Teo&lt;/a&gt; claiming it offers “10 times the benefits” of walking 10,000 steps per day in his viral video above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fitness writer, I’ve covered walking extensively, finding it’s one of the best ways to help people of all fitness levels introduce more movement into their regular routine. So, intrigued, I endeavoured to try “Japanese walking” and find out if the impressive health claims around it held water.&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/K7Ehvq-bm6I"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to try the ‘Japanese walking’ method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete the sequence below five times without any breaks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 dDVXDN jHvNZk"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three minutes of walking at a low intensity (40 per cent peak aerobic capacity, or a relaxed pace) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three minutes of walking at a high intensity (70 per cent peak aerobic capacity, or a brisk pace) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Japanese walking” protocol comes from a study published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17605959/"&gt;Mayo Clinic Proceedings&lt;/a&gt; journal in 2007. It was designed to test whether high-intensity interval walking training (IWT) can offer greater benefits than moderate-intensity continuous walking training, in terms of improving thigh muscle strength, peak aerobic capacity (the maximum amount of oxygen you can take in and use during exercise) and blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over five months, 60 men and 186 women with an average age of 63 were divided into three groups; no walking training, IWT and CWT (continuous walking training). The CWT group was instructed to walk at 50 per cent of their peak aerobic capacity (a fairly slow pace) and take 8,000 or more steps per day at least four times per week. The IWT group was told to complete the protocol above, four or more times per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among participants who met these conditions, those in the IWT group saw a 13 per cent increase in isometric knee flexion, a 17 per cent increase in isometric knee flexion, and an eight per cent increase in peak aerobic capacity for walking. This was “significantly greater than the increases observed in the moderate-intensity continuous walking training group”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also found a greater reduction in resting systolic blood pressure in the IWT group, despite the fact they didn’t spend as much time walking each week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion states: “high-intensity interval walking may protect against age-associated increases in blood pressure and decreases in thigh muscle strength and peak aerobic capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/japanese-walking-trend-weight-loss-b2759539.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The latest walking trend that could help burn more calories and lower blood pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/japanese-walking-trend-weight-loss-b2759539.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 iBjbcX"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Walking is one of the most accessible forms of movement, offering impressive health benefits" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-66833"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Walking is one of the most accessible forms of movement, offering impressive health benefits&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (David Lovelady)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened when I tried Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a full science lab set up at home; what I do have is two legs, a &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-garmin-watch-b1903982.html"&gt;Garmin watch&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of walking experience, so I decided to put these to good use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my Monday lunch break, I took my dog for a 30-minute walk as normal. Then, at 1pm the following day, I tried the “Japanese walking” method on the same looped route, setting my Garmin Vivoactive to record both sessions and taking note of any subjective changes I felt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My usual 30-minute walk saw me accrue nearly 3,000 steps, covering 2.12km at an average speed of 14min 10sec per kilometre. My heart rate averaged 85bpm, remaining fairly constant throughout, and I burned an estimated 157 calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As anyone who has owned a dog might expect, there was a good deal of stopping and starting to inspect particularly interesting trees and bollards, and I defaulted to a fairly casual pace amid a busy work day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Japanese walking protocol, my numbers looked a bit different, with my fast pace falling just below 120 steps per minute and my slow pace a few shy of 100 steps per minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I travelled significantly further, covering 2.94km and 3,500 steps at an average speed of 10min 12sec per kilometre. My average heart rate came out very similar (86bpm) but there were noticeable peaks (104bpm) and troughs in line with the high- and low-speed intervals. My estimated calorie burn was also significantly higher: 211. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/how-many-steps-a-day-cancer-risk-b2756669.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many steps to take each day to slash your risk of cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/how-many-steps-a-day-cancer-risk-b2756669.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the Japanese walking method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that walking faster, or sprinkling more intensity into your exercise, holds greater benefits is nothing new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialist in walking for health, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://education.ua.edu/about/directory/faculty-directory/elroy-aguiar/"&gt;Dr Elroy Aguiar&lt;/a&gt;, is an assistant professor at the University of Alabama’s department of kinesiology. He was the lead author on a 2024 paper published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sms.14762"&gt;Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports&lt;/a&gt;, which correlated as little as one minute of high-intensity activity with improved health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the really interesting findings from our paper was that, if you look at people’s highest one minute of activity across each day, averaged across the monitoring period, that was a very strong signal for whether they had one or more metabolic syndrome risk factors [elevated waist circumference, high triglycerides, low HDL (or “good” cholesterol), high blood pressure and high blood sugar] present,” he tells me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another series of studies he worked on, featured in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29858465/"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, pointed to the fact that “if you walk at a cadence of about 100 steps per minute, that’s equivalent to what’s called ‘moderate-intensity’, and all of the research in this area suggests that most of the benefits [of walking] accumulate at a moderate or higher intensity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, completing the Japanese walking method four times per week leaves you half-an-hour away from the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity"&gt;World Health Organisation’s&lt;/a&gt; “global recommendations of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week”.

However, if we are questioning the claim that it is “better” than walking 10,000 steps a day, there are a few further areas to consider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Dr Aguiar’s 2024 paper supported the idea that the “best” walking method for reducing metabolic risk factors involves a combination of high volume (number of steps) and high intensity (walking speed). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Accumulating a high volume of walking throughout the day [8,000-plus steps], then focussing on at least 30 minutes of faster walking or jogging, would be a way to move the metrics in a positive direction and lower your metrics for each of the [metabolic syndrome] risk factors,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I racked up a little over 3,500 steps when trying the Japanese Walking method – less than half of the 8,000 daily steps research has repeatedly linked to many favourable health outcomes, and short of the 5,000 mark often viewed as the threshold for a sedentary lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this method as part, rather than all, of your daily steps could be a better approach for achieving your health goals. However, if you only have 30 minutes per day free, it still offers dramatically more benefits than not moving at all, and improved return on investment over a regular 30-minute walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area where the Japanese walking method loses out to walking 10,000 steps per day is movement regularity. While the former involves a concentrated 30-minute dose of activity, the latter can be spread throughout the day, encouraging you to abandon your office chair and sofa more often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 10-year study of 8,000 people, published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30551177/"&gt;American Journal of Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;, found that those replaced 30 minutes of daily sitting with light activity had a 17 per cent lower risk of dying in that period. This even applied if they accrued these 30 minutes across short intervals throughout the day – hence why your smartwatch is constantly sending you reminders to stand up and move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular movement can also help maintain mobility and reduce stiffness in our joints and muscles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we’re dealing with an adaptation from stillness, movement is the answer, so any movement is better than just being still,” movement mechanics expert and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetrainingstimulus.com/"&gt;The Training Stimulus&lt;/a&gt; founder Ash Grossmann summarises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final factor to consider is enjoyment. By adding a rigid framework, Japanese walking ensures intensity. However, it also meant I was unable to stop and chat to people in the park or appreciate my surroundings to the same extent. For me, this lowered the stress-busting potential of my walk, sacrificing some of the usual mental health benefits of walking for physical ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/news/health/fart-walk-benefits-type-2-diabetes-cancer-b2744886.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the heck is a fart walk?

But if you can fit one or two quick full-body strength training sessions, regular aerobic activity (like walking) and an occasional dash of more intense exercise into each week, it will stand you in very good stead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is among the most accessible forms of exercise there is, lowering the barrier to entry for exercise for billions of people, which is why I’m always keen to promote it. However, in the modern world, even finding time for a quick walk can be tricky for particularly busy individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese walking method provides a time-savvy way to enjoy many of the benefits of a greater volume of daily walking. Sure, you could enjoy higher-intensity exercise in any number of other forms, from cycling to a HIIT workout, but walking remains the most efficient – you don’t even need a change of clothes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So should you try it? Yes, especially if you’re short on time and looking for a way to squeeze health-boosting movement into your day. And should you stick with it? This depends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy this framework, or find it’s something you can stick to with a good degree of regularity, that’s the ticket to a sustainable movement habit and the many health benefits that come from it. If not, look for an alternative form of moderate- to high-intensity exercise that you find fun, and commit to this instead – consistency is the key to long-term results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 09:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPQzhJSDYtNm5ma3YwTC00ck9Sb0JBdXE5TVREaVpobkVkdFowY3dOTjAxSEVXR0RUUElDeHZjVm9COUt3Q0drc0xsdF9Ga3JmOHpURzdYS2pXTUJhQUh3T0pRTzdHWER3OU1OUHZjNjZtdzNmMnZsT0ZoT3BnZU51bThvNE9QWXZyUXlxNkRCM0tIdDVkWVl4YzhXeHJmWTk2WUVJakxJSQ</guid></item><item><title>“难以置信的疼痛和痛苦” ：常见的咽喉感染如何重新连接儿童的大脑-英国广播公司</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250828-strep-throat-how-a-common-infection-can-rewire-childrens-brains</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-85f9acf9-0 ilQTUs"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Nonetheless, many patients swear by the results provided by treatments like IVIG. When Drury's son developed Pandas more than a decade ago, she was willing to pay thousands of dollars for his first IVIG treatment – which, she says, "brought him back to us". The experience prompted her to become an advocate, pushing for a state law that requires insurers to cover treatments including IVIG for Pans/Pandas patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Charlie's Law" &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/life-stages-populations/maternal-child-family-health-services/pandas-pans.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;passed in Illinois in 2017&lt;/a&gt; – but to this day, Drury says, it can be a struggle to get the right treatments for her son, who is now 20. Charlie has had long periods of remission, but also multiple severe flare ups. Clinicians have told him he will need regular IVIG infusions, as well as plasma exchange therapy, for the rest of his life, says Drury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We'd be in these hospitals and they're like, 'We can't help you'," Drury says. "Even though there's a law in his name."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Pans and Pandas are today recognised by global health authorities – the World Health Organization has added Pandas &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://icd10cmtool.cdc.gov/?fy=FY2021&amp;amp;query=PANDAS" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;to its disease classification system&lt;/a&gt;, for example – and researchers and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://panspandasuk.org/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;patient support groups across the world&lt;/a&gt; are working to improve quality of care and access to it.

This is suitable when pain levels are low and movement is well tolerated," he suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second position involves pressing the hamstring of one leg into a foam roller against the wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kooner recommends holding each position for 20 to 45 seconds for two to four sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aim to do these moves 3 to 5 times per week, often early in a strength session or as part of rehab," he recommends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As with any exercise, depth and duration should be adjusted for comfort, and it’s best to stop if pain worsens and seek professional guidance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-why-are-isometric-holds-so-beneficial-for-knee-pain" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-are-isometric-holds-so-beneficial-for-knee-pain"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why are isometric holds so beneficial for knee pain?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="0d7a809c-c519-435d-96f8-3e1c331f0870"&gt;"Isometric exercises involve holding a position under tension without moving the joint, which not only strengthens muscles but can also help calm down the nervous system’s sensitivity to movement in a painful area," Krooner explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means that doing an isometric hold could provide immediate knee pain relief for some people, as this sensitivity decreases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When an area is irritated, the nervous system can become more protective, sometimes interpreting normal movement as a threat. Isometric contractions provide a safe, controlled way to load the muscles and joints without rapid or excessive movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over time, this repeated, low-threat loading can desensitize the area, reduce pain perception, and restore confidence in movement," Krooner says.&lt;/p&gt;

If effective, it could help curb the opioid crisis by providing a powerful alternative. Credit: Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The discovery of a new painkiller offers relief with fewer side effects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morphine and other opioids are commonly used in medicine because of their strong ability to relieve pain. Yet, they also pose significant risks, including respiratory depression and drug dependence. To limit these dangers, Japan enforces strict rules that allow only specially authorized physicians to prescribe such medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the United States saw widespread prescribing of the opioid OxyContin, which fueled a rise in the misuse of synthetic opioids like &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;fentanyl&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid drug that is similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent. It is used to treat severe pain, such as pain from cancer or surgery, and is typically administered via injection or transdermal patch. Fentanyl can also be used recreationally, and its use has been linked to a significant increase in opioid overdose deaths in recent years. Due to its high potency, fentanyl can be dangerous even in small doses, and its use should be closely monitored by a healthcare provider.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;fentanyl&lt;/span&gt;. By 2023, deaths from opioid overdoses had exceeded 80,000, marking the escalation of a nationwide public health emergency now known as the “opioid crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A new analgesic approach&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opioids may soon face competition. Researchers at &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/kyoto-university/"&gt;Kyoto University&lt;/a&gt; have identified a new analgesic, named &lt;em&gt;ADRIANA&lt;/em&gt;, that provides pain relief through a completely different biological pathway. The drug is now moving through clinical development as part of an international research collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If successfully commercialized, ADRIANA would offer a new pain management option that does not rely on opioids, contributing significantly to the reduction of opioid use in clinical settings,” says corresponding author Masatoshi Hagiwara, a specially-appointed professor at Kyoto University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Targeting adrenoceptors for safer pain relief&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers drew their initial inspiration from compounds that imitate noradrenaline, a chemical released during life-threatening situations that activates α2A-adrenoceptors to reduce pain. While effective, these compounds carry a high risk of destabilizing cardiovascular function. By examining the relationship between noradrenaline levels and α2B-adrenoceptors, the team proposed that selectively blocking α2B-adrenoceptors could increase noradrenaline activity, stimulate α2A-adrenoceptors, and provide pain relief without triggering cardiovascular instability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_491043" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-491043" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mechanism-of-Pain-Relief-by-ADRIANA.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-491043" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mechanism-of-Pain-Relief-by-ADRIANA-777x298.jpg" alt="Mechanism of Pain Relief by ADRIANA" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mechanism-of-Pain-Relief-by-ADRIANA-777x298.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mechanism-of-Pain-Relief-by-ADRIANA-400x153.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mechanism-of-Pain-Relief-by-ADRIANA-768x295.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mechanism-of-Pain-Relief-by-ADRIANA-1536x589.jpg 1536w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mechanism-of-Pain-Relief-by-ADRIANA-150x58.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mechanism-of-Pain-Relief-by-ADRIANA-450x173.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mechanism-of-Pain-Relief-by-ADRIANA-1200x460.jpg 1200w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Mechanism-of-Pain-Relief-by-ADRIANA.jpg 1825w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-491043" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mechanism of pain relief by ADRIANA. Credit: KyotoU / Hagiwara lab&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this idea, the scientists used a specialized method called the TGFα shedding assay, which allowed them to measure the function of different α2-adrenoceptor subtypes. Through compound screening, they succeeded in identifying the world’s first selective α2B-adrenoceptor antagonist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Promising clinical results and future trials&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After success in administering the compound to mice and conducting non-clinical studies to assess its safety, physician-led clinical trials were conducted at Kyoto University Hospital. Both the Phase I trial in healthy volunteers and the Phase II trial in patients with postoperative pain following lung cancer surgery yielded highly promising results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on these outcomes, preparations are now underway for a large-scale Phase II clinical trial in the United States, in collaboration with BTB Therapeutics, Inc, a Kyoto University-originated venture company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Japan’s first non-opioid analgesic, ADRIANA has the potential not only to relieve severe pain for patients worldwide but could also play a meaningful role in addressing the opioid crisis — a pressing social issue in the United States — and thus contribute to international public health efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We aim to evaluate the analgesic effects of ADRIANA across various types of pain and ultimately make this treatment accessible to a broader population of patients suffering from chronic pain,” says Hagiwara.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr., which doesn’t recommend the shots for healthy children of any age but says kids may get the shots in consultation with physicians. Kennedy was an anti-vaccine activist before joining the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The conflicting advice was followed by President Donald Trump's &lt;a href="/story/news/politics/2025/08/27/cdc-director-susan-monarez-is-out-after-less-than-a-month-on-the-job-federal-officials-say/85856653007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez&lt;/a&gt; for what her attorneys said was standing up for science.

"And so my advice to parents is really lean on your health care provider."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, for its part, &lt;a href="/story/news/local/michigan/2025/07/29/michigan-officials-recommend-covid-19-shots-for-pregnant-mothers-kids/85409150007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;announced in July&lt;/a&gt; that it's continuing to recommend the COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy and for every person 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Communications Director Andrew Nixon contended that Americans "deserve confidence" that medical recommendations are "based solely on science and public health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We call on the AAP to strengthen conflict-of-interest safeguards and keep its publications free from financial influence, ensuring every recommendation reflects only the best interests of America’s children," Nixon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement that her organization is "transparent about our funders," follows rigorous conflict-of-interest disclosures and maintains safeguards to "ensure the integrity and independence of our guidance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We welcome an opportunity to sit down with the Secretary to review our recommendations and restore our seat at the table," said Kressly, whose group and other medical groups sued Kennedy in July for making unilateral, unscientific changes to federal vaccine policy they said are an “assault on science, public health and evidence-based medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The revamped COVID-19 vaccines target a newer version of the virus and are set to begin shipping immediately. But it could be days or weeks before many Americans know if they’ll be able to get one, with access dependent on decisions by federal health advisers, private health insurers, pharmacies and state authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ferndale mom Christina Renkert, 39, called the FDA's decision to limit access to the vaccine "a terrible political move."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I think it's stupid they're limiting it for anyone," Renkert said. "I mean, if people want to get the vaccine, I don't understand why they're telling them not to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But Warren resident Matthew Wallin said he has been against COVID-19 vaccines since "Day 1." His daughters, who are 5 and 7, haven't gotten the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We are not about getting those shots," Wallin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;AAP's advice for very young children&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The AAP recommends all kids ages 6 to 23 months get vaccinated against COVID-19. The organization noted that the rate of COVID-19 hospitalization for children under 2 years is the highest among pediatric age groups, and the rate for kids 6-23 months of age is comparable with that of people 50-64 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The AAP's recommendations are developed by pediatricians who have expertise in infectious diseases and are based on the science in this area, said Dr. Lynn Smitherman, a pediatrician at Wayne Pediatrics in Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"They take a painstaking amount of time and detail to gather information to … make these recommendations when it comes to vaccines," said Smitherman, who is a member-at-large of the Board of Directors of the Michigan Chapter of the AAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Children under 6 months of age may still have protection from maternal antibodies, and researchers haven't really been able to study the vaccine's safety and efficacy for kids under 6 months, she said. But for children 6 months to 2 years old, many are now back in daycare after the COVID-19 pandemic, some may have siblings and some might have caregivers who are older and ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"That's why this particular population is being targeted, because of the exposure and their potential of spreading disease among more vulnerable people as well," Smitherman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Dr. Rebecca Schein, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Michigan State University, said that when COVID-19 first appeared, health providers found that children were disproportionately less affected by the disease. Most children had minor symptoms and weren't severely ill, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;However, a small portion of children and adults had multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS), a condition associated with the virus that causes COVID-19. These kids had over-aggressive immune responses that caused very severe illness and a few deaths before physicians figured out how to treat it, Schein said. In MIS, different body parts become inflamed, such as the heart, lungs and kidneys, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Schein noted that there weren't any cases of MIS in children who had been vaccinated before they had COVID-19 for the first time. That's why the AAP is recommending vaccinating kids 6 months to 2 years of age, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"That's the group that's at risk for that most severe immune response, and that's what we're trying to protect people from," Schein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Guidance for other children&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The AAP also recommended a single dose of the 2025-26 COVID-19 vaccine for children 2-18 years old who are at high risk of severe COVID-19; reside in long-term care facilities or other congregate settings; have never been vaccinated; or have household contacts at high risk for severe COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The AAP said kids who are not in these groups but whose parents or guardians want their children protected from COVID-19 should be offered a single dose of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Smitherman said "the bottom line" is that the AAP feels everyone should be vaccinated. She noted that children at high risk, including those with asthma and immune disorders, "should definitely be immunized" with the current vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"And those that are otherwise healthy, they're still recommending that they strongly consider being vaccinated with the current vaccine, just to be on the safe side," Smitherman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Guzmán said the Oakland County Health Division doesn't issue vaccine guidance or recommendations, but it has "standing orders" from the division's medical director that give registered nurses the legal authority to act on the division's behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Our standing orders will reflect the AAP guidance that anyone coming in for a COVID vaccine shall not be turned away," she said. "And we will stick with that because we feel really importantly that the protection that the COVID-19 vaccine offers is important to everyone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;With the AAP announcement last week, "the main confusion" is whether insurance companies are going to pay for vaccines for people not in the CDC's recommended groups, Guzman said. She encouraged families to seek out their local health department. The departments give out vaccines "on a sliding fee scale," Guzman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Macomb County Health Officer Andrew Cox said his health department knows that vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, are "very effective" at limiting severe illness and severe hospitalizations, so the agency will continue to promote those vaccines. The health department typically follows the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services' guidance and supports their recommendations, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The state health department, which recommends the COVID-19 vaccine for every person 6 months and older, said the vaccine was approved following rigorous testing and safety review processes, including clinical trials and review by medical experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"To protect and promote the health and safety of all residents, we encourage everyone to stay up to date on all vaccinations," said Lynn Sutfin, a spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;HHS criticizes AAP&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Trump administration is pushing back against the medical establishment, including the lawsuits they have filed against certain administration moves. Nixon with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the AAP is "undermining national immunization policymaking with baseless political attacks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Secretary Kennedy has stood firm in his commitment to science, transparency, and restoring public trust," he said. "By bypassing the CDC’s advisory process and freelancing its own recommendations, while smearing those who demand accountability, the AAP is putting commercial interests ahead of public health and politics above America’s children."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The AAP's Kressly said her organization created its vaccine schedule based on the health of children and "the evidence showing how vaccines support their immune systems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"This attack on the integrity of pediatricians is unfortunate, but it does not change the facts," she said in a statement about social media posts made by Kennedy. "For nearly a century, the American Academy of Pediatrics' mission has focused on one thing: following the science to best protect children's health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She noted that the AAP's immunization recommendations are rooted in decades of peer-reviewed science by the nation's leading health experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On Wednesday, the FDA narrowed updated COVID-19 shots' use for children and young adults to those with at least one high-risk health condition. Additionally, Pfizer’s vaccine will no longer be available for any child under age 5, after the FDA said it was revoking the shot’s emergency authorization for that age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Parents still can seek shots from rival drugmaker Moderna, the other maker of mRNA vaccines, which has full FDA approval for children as young as 6 months. But the company’s Spikevax vaccine is only approved for children with at least one serious health problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Kressly said Wednesday's announcement proposing to limit the availability of COVID-19 vaccines for children and young adults is "deeply troubling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Any parent who wants their child vaccinated should have access to this vaccine; today’s unprecedented action from HHS not only prevents this option for many families, but adds further confusion and stress for parents trying to make the best choices for their children," she said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What parents think&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For parents, the conflicting guidance means they'll have to decide which advice to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Wallin, the Warren dad, said he has been anti-vaccine since his childhood, as his mother is opposed to vaccines. His mother beat cancer through holistic approaches, and he also uses holistic medicine, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/27/PDTN/85847378007-img-2313.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=495&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/27/PDTN/85847378007-img-2313.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=990&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Warren resident Matthew Wallin plays with his daughter, Charlie, right, and Cameron, left, at the playground at the Red Oaks Youth Soccer Complex in Madison Heights on Monday.

I guess it really depends on that, too," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Wallin said he decided not to vaccinate his daughters against COVID-19 because of his concerns about vaccines in general and because of how quickly the COVID-19 vaccine was developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I'd rather see how it does and the longevity of it, or something like that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Renkert, the Ferndale mom, said her daughter has been vaccinated against COVID-19, and she and her husband plan to immunize her and themselves again this fall. She said they will wait to hear if their daughter can get the vaccine, as she doesn't have a health condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The family plans to pay for the vaccine out-of-pocket if their health insurance doesn't cover it, Renkert said. She noted that her husband had open-heart surgery in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"It's the sort of thing where we don't feel the need to take unnecessary risks with something like that," Renkert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/27/PDTN/85847439007-img-2323.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=495&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/27/PDTN/85847439007-img-2323.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=990&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Christina Renkert of Ferndale said Monday she and her husband plan to vaccinate their daughter and themselves against COVID-19 this fall."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Christina Renkert of Ferndale said Monday she and her husband plan to vaccinate their daughter and themselves against COVID-19 this fall." data-c-credit="Anne Snabes/The Detroit News"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Playing with her daughter recently at Royal Oak's Lawson Park, she said she and her husband have been "believers of the vaccine" since it came out and are believers in "science and data and all of that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Potential confusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Wayne Pediatrics' Smitherman said she has seen confusion among parents about the federal government's recommendations and about COVID-19 vaccines in general. She said she is spending more time explaining and justifying the need for vaccines overall, not just the COVID-19 one, than she did previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Vaccination rates overall have declined in Michigan since 2019. Michigan health officials have said Michigan's coverage for the routine childhood immunization series was around 75% in 2019; it's now around 70%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;COVID-19 vaccination rates are even lower, according to state figures. Quarterly immunization report cards for every county in the state showed 1.5% of kids 6 months to 17 years old were fully vaccinated for COVID as of June 2025 in Macomb County, 3.3% in Wayne County and 5.5% in Oakland. Statewide, 5% of children aged 5 to 15 and 3% of children under 5 received the 2024-2025 updated COVID-19 vaccine as of June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Smitherman said she wants parents to feel comfortable with the health care decisions they're making for their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"And I have no problem sitting down and talking to them and explaining my point of view," Smitherman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There is a lot of misinformation about potential side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"And trying to debunk all of that information can be, it can be tiring sometimes," Smitherman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Guzmán, Oakland County’s health officer, said that those with a primary care provider should "lean on them, trust in them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For families without a provider, she hopes they can lean on the Oakland County Health Division. The division has a nurse on-call hotline — (800) 848-5533 — and nurses can provide information on vaccines, Guzman said. Families can also walk into the division's health centers and get answers to their questions, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I'm really hoping that in this time of confusion and uncertainty, the public health departments can be a steadfast resource for everyone in the community, so that families aren't trying to find their own information and going online and just Google searching things, right?" Guzman said. "I hope that they can lean on us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;asnabes@detroitnews.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Associated Press contributed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 03:02:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8wFBVV95cUxNR2YyZmx4S0E1aktSeUdQNmNHRGZBWnRwUVhVSXZHVHlzNV9leGVzOEUwcHVEOHZyWVNrZm01eG1XZGpVaVpEaERmTGY2amxDUTN3aDdfSE9OcDEtWG5LaUZ6RGNWdDJEdnd6OHQySzNkNUJaV1N1SHBQUzY3dDF0OWxSeGdFRVNZY1p0NGE1SkVPZWwzUlpRdnRhMXRYaTlyLXJfMFhBYTJZV1dBcVg4VWw1MnFvQVl4UXRMRjY1Y0FtSTlnRDlGTXhOQURJc0pQSnRLUFFqQ2QwWl8zY2kxM1JtdnVOaGVtVlY3Qk9ONUZ1RWM</guid></item><item><title>您的脖子大小可能是隐性健康问题的信号- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/your-neck-size-could-be-a-signal-for-hidden-health-problems</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Doctors have long relied on measurements like &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2011.00879.x"&gt;body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratios&lt;/a&gt; to assess health risks. However, researchers are increasingly focusing their attention on an unexpected indicator: neck circumference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thick neck might project strength, like that of heavyweight boxers or rugby players, but studies suggest it could signal a concerning health issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BMI, which divides weight by height to estimate body fat, doesn't always tell the complete story. A competitive bodybuilder might have a high BMI, but clearly isn't obese. This is where neck circumference offers additional insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-obesity-definition-shifts-focus-from-bmi-heres-the-science-behind-it"&gt;New Obesity Definition Shifts Focus From BMI – Here's The Science Behind It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that people with larger necks relative to their body size face increased risks of several serious health conditions. The connection lies in what neck size reveals about fat distribution, particularly in the upper body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fat around your &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpendo.90357.2008"&gt;upper body&lt;/a&gt; releases fatty acids into your blood, which can interfere with how your body manages cholesterol, blood sugar and heart rhythm. Essentially, neck circumference serves as a proxy for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-022-01160-w"&gt;visceral fat&lt;/a&gt; – the harmful fat that wraps around your organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence linking neck size to health problems is striking. People with thicker necks show increased rates of several &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002870319300511"&gt;cardiovascular diseases&lt;/a&gt;, including hypertension, atrial fibrillation and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526072/"&gt;Atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt; is particularly concerning. This condition causes irregular heartbeat and blood flow, potentially leading to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2397836"&gt;blood clots and stroke&lt;/a&gt;. The electrical imbalance in the heart can eventually progress to heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neck circumference also correlates with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743524000148"&gt;coronary heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, where the main arteries to the heart narrow and restrict oxygen-rich blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But cardiovascular problems aren't the only concern. Larger neck circumference increases the risk of developing &lt;a href="https://dmsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13098-023-01111-z"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.dovepress.com/correlation-between-neck-circumference-and-gestational-diabetes-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-DMSO"&gt;gestational diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="172490" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Diabetes&lt;/a&gt; can lead to serious long-term complications, including vision loss and limb amputations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also a connection to sleep disorders. Thick necks have been linked to &lt;a href="https://medscimonit.com/abstract/index/idArt/883776"&gt;obstructive sleep apnoea&lt;/a&gt;, where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. This condition causes extreme daytime fatigue and strains the cardiovascular system. People with sleep apnoea face higher risks of &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/14/3971"&gt;car accidents&lt;/a&gt; due to their exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what constitutes a risky neck size? For men, &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/JAHA.121.022340"&gt;17 inches (43 cm)&lt;/a&gt; or greater increases health risks. For women, the threshold is &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/JAHA.121.022340"&gt;14 inches (35.5 cm)&lt;/a&gt; or greater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172496" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172496" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/womans_neck_642.jpg" alt="back of a woman's neck" class="wp-image-172496 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/womans_neck_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/womans_neck_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/womans_neck_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172496" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Anything above a 14-inch circumference neck size in women may indicate health risks. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEcTuxCZUg/"&gt;Miriam Alonso/Pexels/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most surprisingly, these risks persist even in people with normal BMI. You could have a healthy weight according to traditional measures, but still face elevated health risks due to neck circumference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for each &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/inthealth/article/16/6/664/7564829"&gt;additional centimetre&lt;/a&gt; of neck circumference beyond these thresholds, death rates and hospitalisation rates increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for you&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your neck measures above these thresholds, it's not cause for panic – but it is worth taking seriously. Neck size represents just one piece of your overall health picture, but it's an important one that's often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that neck circumference can change with lifestyle modifications. Cardiovascular exercise and weight training can help reduce upper-body fat. Quality sleep supports metabolic regulation and recovery. A balanced diet rich in pulses, fruits, and vegetables provides essential nutrients without excess calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measuring your neck takes seconds with a tape measure. Simply wrap it around the narrowest part of your neck, ensuring the tape is snug but not tight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172499" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172499" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/measuring_neck_642.jpg" alt="measuring man's neck" class="wp-image-172499 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/measuring_neck_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/measuring_neck_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/measuring_neck_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172499" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Measuring your neck with a tape measure is easy.

While neck circumference shouldn't replace other health assessments, it offers another tool for understanding your cardiovascular and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an era where we're constantly seeking better ways to predict and prevent disease, sometimes the answers are literally right in front of us. Your neck might be revealing more about your health than you realise – and it's worth paying attention.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263483/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Known as the “silent assassin,” it often creeps in quietly. You feel fine, yet the force in your arteries runs high day after day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top number, called systolic pressure, is the one doctors watch most closely because it signals how hard your heart is &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-you-position-your-arm-can-alter-blood-pressure-readings-according-to-scientists/"&gt;working with each beat&lt;/a&gt;. Even a small nudge downward can lower the odds of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have a wide range of medicines that help, but picking the right plan isn’t easy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One pill or two? Standard dose or higher? Different drug classes or more of the same? People want clear answers before they commit to a new routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, an innovative &lt;a href="https://www.bpmodel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Blood Pressure Treatment Efficacy Calculator&lt;/a&gt; enables doctors to predict how much different medications are likely to lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-comprehensive-blood-pressure-study"&gt;Comprehensive blood pressure study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers pulled together the highest-quality evidence available: 484 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with 104,176 participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start, average blood pressure hovered around 154/100 mm Hg. Follow-up lasted roughly nine weeks – long enough to see the full effect in a setting where participants took the medicine as prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They asked direct questions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What drop can you usually count on from a single standard-dose drug? What happens if you double that dose? What if you combine two different drug classes? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then used those answers to build a simple way to predict average results for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/trying-to-lower-your-blood-pressure-this-common-nutrient-can-help/"&gt;common choices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-numbers-show"&gt;What the numbers show&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single blood pressure medicine at a standard dose lowered &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;systolic pressure&lt;/a&gt; by 8.7 mm Hg on average. Doubling the dose added about 1.5 mm Hg – modest rather than a big change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some drug classes showed more gain with higher doses, especially calcium channel blockers; &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/beta-blockers/art-20044522" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;beta-blockers&lt;/a&gt; changed little when the dose increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pairing two different drug classes – each at a standard dose – produced a larger effect: a 14.9 mm Hg average drop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doubling both components added another 2.5 mm Hg. Adding a second drug class was around four times more effective than doubling the dose of a single medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clear-target-many-choices"&gt;Clear target, many choices&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is really important because every 1mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure lowers your risk of heart attack or stroke by two percent,” said Nelson Wang, cardiologist and Research Fellow at &lt;a href="https://www.georgeinstitute.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The George Institute for Global Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But with dozens of drugs, multiple doses per drug, and most patients needing two or more drugs, there are literally thousands of possible options, and no easy way to work out how effective they are,” Wang explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood pressure changes from moment to moment, day to day and by season – these random fluctuations can easily be as big or larger than the changes &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/standing-still-exercises-beat-running-for-blood-pressure-control/"&gt;brought about by treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also, measurement practices are often not perfect, bringing in an additional source of uncertainty – this means it’s very hard to reliably assess how well a medicine is working just by taking repeated measurements,” Wang continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-pressure-baseline-impact"&gt;Blood pressure baseline impact&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/"&gt;Starting pressure&lt;/a&gt; matters. Across single-drug regimens, for every 10 mm Hg lower at baseline, the expected drop decreases by about 1.3 mm Hg. Treatment still works at lower baseline pressures; there’s simply less excess pressure to remove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make decisions easier, the team grouped treatment “intensity” by predicted systolic reduction: low (&amp;lt;10 mm Hg), moderate (10–19 mm Hg), and high (≥20 mm Hg). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most single drugs at standard doses fall into the low category. Many two-drug combinations land in the moderate range, and certain higher-dose pairs or three-drug mixes reach high intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-predicting-combinations"&gt;Predicting combinations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis didn’t stop at describing past trials. Using averages from single-drug studies, the researchers predicted the effects of two-drug combinations and compared those predictions with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/just-5-minutes-of-daily-exercise-can-lower-blood-pressure/"&gt;real trial results&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The match was strong, with a correlation of about 0.76, suggesting that the calculator offers a realistic expectation for most common pairings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Rodgers, Senior Professorial Fellow at The George Institute for Global Health, noted that hypertension is a top reason for clinic visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, clinicians haven’t had one up-to-date source that shows how effective different medicines are – especially in combinations or at varying doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using the [&lt;a href="https://www.bpmodel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Blood Pressure Treatment Efficacy Calculator&lt;/a&gt;] challenges the traditional ‘start low, go slow, measure and judge’ approach to treatment, which comes with the high probability of being misled by BP readings, inertia setting in or the burden on patients being too much,” Rodgers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With this new method you specify how much you need to lower blood pressure, choose an ideal treatment plan to achieve that based on the evidence, and get the patient started on that ideally sooner rather than later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-it-all-means"&gt;What it all means&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone needs only a small nudge downward, a single medicine at a standard dose is often sufficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the goal is a bigger change – about 15 to 20 points – adding a second drug class usually gets there more reliably than pushing a single drug to higher doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That matches &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/lasers-and-light-replace-the-cuff-in-blood-pressure-breakthrough-scos/"&gt;real-world experience&lt;/a&gt; in clinics where most patients need more than one medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because expected effects depend on baseline, the same regimen appears more potent when baseline pressure is high and slightly less potent when it is closer to the goal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intensity tiers give clinicians a quick yardstick to match treatment to the needed reduction, and then fine-tune based on side effects, other conditions, and ongoing home or clinic readings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-of-blood-pressure-treatment"&gt;Future of blood pressure treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the enormous scale of this challenge, even modest improvements will have a large public health impact – increasing the percentage of people whose hypertension is under control globally to just 50% could save many millions of lives,” Professor Rodgers added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small changes matter. A standard-dose medicine typically lowers systolic pressure by a meaningful amount. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because lower systolic pressure reduces cardiovascular risk, selecting an evidence-based regimen using the intensity framework and calculator can help bring pressure into a safer zone over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00991-2/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?

The netting is pulled out and placed into a plastic bag, where it is frozen back at the lab so it can be inspected. Carbon dioxide is pumped into the canister and a small scent device adds extra enticement for the aegypti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s supposed to mimic how an organism, in this case a human, helps attract the mosquitoes,” Baures said.  The mosquitoes prefer older, established neighborhoods with shade trees and more vegetated backyards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aegypti were found in California for the first time in 2013, and by 2020, they were discovered in Redding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since 2022, the aegypti have exploded in Redding,” Partin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img data-lazyloaded="1" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-src="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-64022" data-srcset="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372.jpg 900w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372-300x168.jpg 300w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372-768x431.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-64022" srcset="https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372.jpg 900w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372-300x168.jpg 300w, https://ashland.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-08-28-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-623372-768x431.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Mosquito Control employees put hang cards on neighborhood doors to warn of the presence of day-biting mosquitoes.

Davis sponsors summer internship programs, which helped to train Baures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emilio DeBess, state public health veterinarian in the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division, said aegypti’s discovery in Oregon is a concern because the species has been more common in much warmer climates of the United States, Southeast Asia, Africa and the Pacific Islands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These mosquitoes have been known carry and transmit diseases that are more typical to warmer climates, such as Zika virus, chikungunya, dengue and yellow fever,” DeBess said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, DeBess emphasized that the risk of these infections to local residents is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Acquiring these diseases depends on the presence or arrival of someone who is currently infected with one of the diseases after infection outside the United States,” DeBess said in a news release. “As was the case when Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were first found in Oregon in 2024, there have been no reports of anyone having acquired viruses associated with Ae. aegypti from within the state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Staying safe&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p class="has-text-align-left"&gt;Residents can take these steps to help prevent the spread of aegypti:&lt;br&gt;    • Dumping or draining any standing water around the home.&lt;br&gt;    • Removing containers or objects that can hold water from your yard, such as water saucers from under plants, old tires, tarps, buckets, containers, toys, and other equipment.&lt;br&gt;    • Repairing leaky outdoor faucets.&lt;br&gt;    • Keeping rain gutters cleared.&lt;br&gt;    • Covering, screening, or removing rain barrels, trashcans, bins, buckets, or tubs.&lt;br&gt;    • Wearing mosquito repellent outside. Repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, some lemon eucalyptus, and para-menthane-diol products are most effective at preventing mosquito bites.&lt;br&gt;    • Sleeping under a mosquito net when outside or in a room without screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reach freelance writer Damian Mann at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4e2a232f2020202b393d0e29232f2722602d2123"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d2b6bfb3bcbcbcb7a5a192b5bfb3bbbefcb1bdbf"&gt;[email protected]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Related story: &lt;a href="https://ashland.news/oregon-officials-find-mosquito-that-can-transmit-deadly-viruses-in-southern-oregon/"&gt;Oregon officials find mosquito that can transmit deadly viruses in Southern Oregon&lt;/a&gt; (Aug. 31, 2024)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ashland News</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 23:57:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE91VTBHOWRnejhYTUMyTlI2TngwdGdIc0w5ZnlXLUVfb3BpY2QxQ0pMQnUxejN6OHVXOXRmazJQX0t3d1RjdFhjNFl3LWdySS1pYWJVeXo5Y1JVNU5fY3V3NEd6RGIzaFkyVU4wVGtVVnJLZw</guid></item><item><title>居民对蚊子传播的衰弱性疾病的担忧加剧： “扩展到新地区” - yahoo.com</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/concerns-rise-resident-comes-down-233000518.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In summer 2025, a Hong Kong resident developed symptoms of the mosquito-borne illness chikungunya — the first time the area had seen a case in six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The illness chikungunya is primarily transmitted via mosquito bites. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-04/hong-kong-sees-first-mosquito-borne-illness-from-china-outbreak" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bloomberg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; reported that a 12-year-old developed a rash, fever, and significant joint pain after traveling to Foshan, China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In previous weeks, the city of Foshan had reported over 6,500 infections, which had officials worried about the spread, per Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Hong Kong Food and Environmental Hygiene Department used mosquito control techniques at the patient's home.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As we age, the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-of-cognitive-decline-11767736" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;risk of cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;, like memory loss or trouble focusing, rises. Dementia, which is a condition that severely impacts daily life and independence, becomes a large concern as well. Adding to the challenge, many older adults also face &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/early-adulthood-inflammation-may-influence-cognition-in-midlife-8676000" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;multiple chronic health concerns&lt;/a&gt; (known as multimorbidity), which can impact the risk of developing cognitive decline. Plus, cognitive issues themselves may worsen physical health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This creates a vicious cycle that affects quality of life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Interestingly, what we eat plays a big role in brain health. Diets like the Mediterranean diet, rich in whole grains, fish, fruits and vegetables, have been shown to protect against diseases like dementia by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reducing inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-to-eat-every-week-for-better-brain-health-11784254" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;supporting brain function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But more research is needed to understand how specific foods affect cognitive function in older adults with multiple health conditions. To bridge this knowledge gap, researchers recently explored how different types of food impact cognitive symptoms in older adults with multiple health conditions, and the results were published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study used data from the 2017–2018 China Longitudinal Health Longevity Survey (CLHLS), a large-scale project led by Peking University to study older adults in China. The survey, conducted seven times between 1998 and 2018, collected detailed information on health, lifestyle and diet from participants aged 65 and older. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this analysis, researchers focused on 3,443 older adults with multiple chronic conditions and available data on cognitive function and food consumption. Food intake was measured using a simple questionnaire that asked how often participants ate 13 specific foods, including fruits, vegetables, meat and dairy, with responses ranging from "almost every day" to "rarely or never." Cognitive function was assessed using a test called the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), which evaluates memory, attention, language and more, with scores adjusted for education level to define cognitive impairment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study also looked at multimorbidity, defined as having two or more chronic conditions, like diabetes, heart disease or arthritis. Researchers analyzed how food consumption and cognitive function are connected using advanced statistical tools called network analysis. This method visualizes relationships as a web, where symptoms and variables are "nodes," and their connections are "edges." Thicker edges show stronger links, and colors (green or red) indicate positive or negative associations. The analysis identified the most influential symptoms (central nodes) and bridging symptoms that connect different clusters, helping pinpoint areas for intervention. The study also tested the reliability of these findings using statistical methods to ensure the results were stable and accurate.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Within the cognitive abilities group, attention and calculation were most closely linked to language skills, while memory and recall abilities also had a strong connection. On the food side, two foods had the strongest links. They were: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;nut products (like almonds or walnuts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;mushrooms or algae (such as seaweed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some foods stood out as particularly influential in the network. Mushrooms or algae had the highest impact, followed by dairy products and nut products, showing their central role in supporting cognitive health. When looking at how food and cognitive abilities interact, fresh fruits were most strongly connected to orientation ability (knowing time, place, etc.), followed by fresh vegetables. Fresh vegetables also had the least influence in the food group, and orientation ability was the least connected in the cognitive group—meaning that veggies are less likely to influence the kinds of foods you eat and orientation ability is less likely to affect other parts of cognition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While this study offers fresh insights into how different foods relate to specific cognitive abilities, it does have a few limitations. First, because it’s based on a snapshot in time—using a cross-sectional design—we can’t say for sure whether eating certain foods directly improves cognitive function or if other factors are at play. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Second, the data relies on participants’ memory to report their food habits and cognitive abilities, which could introduce some inaccuracies. Lastly, even though the study included a nationally representative sample, the findings might not fully apply to certain regions or specific groups of people. Future research with diverse populations will be important to confirm and expand on these results.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study highlights the powerful role that food can play in supporting brain health, especially for older adults dealing with multiple chronic health conditions. For example, incorporating more mushrooms, nuts and dairy products into your diet could have a meaningful impact on cognitive abilities like memory and attention. These foods were found to be particularly influential in the study, suggesting they may help bridge the gap between physical health and brain function. Even simple changes, like adding a handful of walnuts to your yogurt or adding mushrooms to your burger or stir fry, could be a step toward better cognitive health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The findings also emphasize the importance of a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-diet-to-reach-70-study-11703981" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;holistic approach to aging&lt;/a&gt; healthfully. Cognitive health doesn’t exist in isolation; it’s closely tied to physical health and lifestyle choices. By focusing on nutrient-rich foods that reduce inflammation and support brain function, older adults can potentially &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-8786846" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;slow cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; and improve their quality of life. While more research is needed to confirm these connections and explore how specific foods impact brain health over time, this study provides a practical starting point. It’s a reminder that what we eat matters, not just for our bodies but for our minds, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;small, intentional dietary changes&lt;/a&gt; can make a big difference as we age.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By analyzing data from a large-scale survey, researchers identified specific foods, like mushrooms, nuts and dairy products, that play a central role in supporting brain function. These findings suggest that certain dietary choices may help improve cognitive abilities such as memory and attention, while also highlighting the complex relationship between physical and mental health. Although the study doesn’t prove cause and effect, it provides valuable insights into how food can influence brain health and offers a foundation for future research.&lt;br&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;A recent study from Harvard Medical School asks whether the element lithium might be a key factor in whether someone develops Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by Dr. Bruce Yankner, professor of genetics and neurology at Harvard Medical School, the almost-decade long study says it is the first to show that lithium is found &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02471-4"&gt;naturally&lt;/a&gt; in the brain in small amounts and suggests that the element plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09335-x"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; this month found a link between lithium deficiency in the brain and an increase in amyloid plaques and tau tangles — known contributors to the development of Alzheimer’s disease. In trials on mice, researchers found they were able to reverse the disease, prevent brain cell damage and restore memory loss through a small dosage of a lithium compound called lithium orotate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="pullquote"&gt;

    &lt;p class="pullquote__icon"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="pullquote__quote"&gt;In trials on mice, researchers found they were able to reverse the disease, prevent brain cell damage and restore memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts told PBS News that it’s premature to conclude from the results that people should use lithium as a treatment or prophylactic for Alzheimer’s disease — but if the findings are confirmed through a randomized human controlled trial, measuring lithium levels could potentially help with early detection of the disease and provide a broader understanding of aging brains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My hope is that if lithium worked out, it might actually restore function, not only change the slope of decline. It certainly does that in the advanced mouse models,” Yankner said. “So I’m optimistic, but we have to hold judgment until we see what happens in people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is lithium and how is it used?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/ethnic-and-cultural-studies/lithium-li"&gt;Lithium&lt;/a&gt; is a naturally occurring element in the same family as sodium and potassium. The alkali metal is soft and silvery, and used for a variety of purposes, from nuclear power to ceramics, but most famously in batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/water-domestic-lithium-mining"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; How demand for lithium batteries could drain America’s water resources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metal has also been used as a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3712976/"&gt;mood stabilizer&lt;/a&gt; for people with bipolar and other mood disorders since the 1900s. &lt;a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geology/lithium.htm"&gt;7 Up sodas&lt;/a&gt; even contained lithium citrate from 1929 to the 1940s, until the FDA banned the compound from all soda and beer due to reports of overuse leading to &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Making_Medicine/NvJjEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;dq=FDA+banned+lithium+in+beer+and+soft+drinks&amp;amp;pg=PA42&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover"&gt;lithium toxicity&lt;/a&gt;, including symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past studies have considered lithium as a factor in dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2017 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28832877/"&gt;Danish study&lt;/a&gt; found there was a possible link between lower rates of dementia in certain regions of Denmark and “microlevels” of lithium in the drinking water, suggesting “even exposure to slightly higher lithium levels over a longer period of time can have a potentially major impact on dementia,” Yankner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What the study found about lithium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_530071" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-530071" src="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/08/GettyImages-2228192208-1024x681.jpg" alt="New hope for Alzheimer's: Groundbreaking Harvard study finds lithium reverses brain aging" class="size-large wp-image-530071" srcset="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/08/GettyImages-2228192208-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/08/GettyImages-2228192208-300x200.jpg 300w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/08/GettyImages-2228192208-768x511.jpg 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/08/GettyImages-2228192208-425x283.jpg 425w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/08/GettyImages-2228192208-1200x798.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-530071" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Jason Choi, Zhen Kai Ngian, Dr. Bruce Yankner, Monlan Yuan and Liviu Aron in their Harvard research lab on Aug. 4, 2025. The authors of a recent medical paper in Nature found that lithium may help protect against brain aging and Alzheimer’s disease. The authors of the paper pose for a portrait  Photo by Heather Diehl/The Boston Globe via Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/could-lithium-explain-treat-alzheimers-disease"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; used postmortem brain tissue from the Memory and Aging Project by Rush University in Chicago, donated by thousands of study participants ranging across all levels of the cognitive disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using advanced tools that could detect trace amounts of metals in the brain and blood — something that older machines were not sensitive enough to do in the past — Yankner’s team found that donors with mild impairment and advanced Alzheimer’s had lower lithium levels compared to cognitively healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For donors with early signs of memory loss, “the lithium levels were one of the first things to drop,” Yankner said. “And also full-blown Alzheimer’s disease, we saw a few metals had changed, just as other people had seen. But the most significant change was actually in this natural level of lithium.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also experimented with restricting the lithium intake of normal mice and Alzheimer’s mice – mice that model Alzheimer genes found in humans. They found that in healthy mice, a lithium-deficient diet accelerated cognitive decline, loss of synaptic connections between neurons and memory loss. In the Alzheimer’s mice, the formation of amyloid plaques – clumps of sticky protein that disrupt brain function that are trademarks of Alzheimer’s disease – was accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/how-a-mouse-watching-the-matrix-helped-scientists-create-the-largest-map-of-a-brain-to-date"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; How a mouse watching ‘The Matrix’ helped scientists create the largest map of a brain to date&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yankner and his colleagues discovered that lithium gets depleted in the brain when amyloid plaques bind to the metal, which reduces the lithium’s availability to other necessary brain functions, like microglia cells that mount immune responses and repair damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microglias are the “scavengers or macrophages of the brain,” Yankner said, and one of their key functions is to clear the amyloid plaques. The researchers discovered that in a lithium-deficient brain, microglia were not able to perform their function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team tried out various lithium compounds on the mice. The amyloid plaques were found to bind to lithium carbonate, the compound commonly prescribed for mood disorders, making it less effective in preventing the development of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous clinical trials, lithium carbonate had shown some efficacy in fighting the disease, but the high dosage used can be toxic to older people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium orotate, which is currently marketed as a dietary supplement for people, avoided being bound by the amyloid plaques in the study by Yankner’s team. Using a dose of lithium orotate on mice at &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/could-lithium-explain-treat-alzheimers-disease"&gt;one-thousandth&lt;/a&gt; the clinical dose of lithium carbonate showed to be the most effective treatment so far for reversing memory loss in the studied animals without causing toxicity, Yankner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can taking a lithium supplement prevent Alzheimer’s disease?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t start taking a lithium supplement just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice studies do not always reflect human trials, according to Rachel Whitmer, professor of public health sciences and neurology at UC Davis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“How you translate to applying that experiment [in mice] to humans is more complicated and takes longer, but with the right planning, it can absolutely happen and it can absolutely be successful,” said Whitmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yankner added that his team is exploring “whether lithium orotate is the best we can do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Using the screening approach and platform we’ve developed, we might even be able to find a better lithium compound,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ronald Petersen, director of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center and the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, said it is too early for people to alter their diets or use a lithium replacement for a potential approach to prevent and treat Alzheimer’s disease. He recommended watching the next stages of this line of research as it “may be a potential insight into one of the therapeutic pathways,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What comes next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been major advances in Alzheimer’s research, according to Whitmer. In the past, one of the only ways to identify the disease was finding tau tangles and amyloid plaques in the brain during an autopsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today, and medical researchers have developed tests to detect biomarkers – biological molecules found in blood that can indicate the presence of conditions or diseases – &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/2021-2022-alzheimers-disease-related-dementias-scientific-advances/biomarker-research"&gt;for Alzheimer’s in living patients&lt;/a&gt;. Health care providers can also perform &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/diagnosis/medical_tests#brain"&gt;brain imaging and lumbar punctures,&lt;/a&gt; to determine if a person has abnormal levels of amyloid and tau in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much more recently, plasma markers, which are blood-based biomarkers, have suggested to scientists that underlying pathologies in the brain can be seen in blood, according to Petersen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yankner said the next steps will be determining whether there is an effective dose of lithium orotate or another lithium compound for humans that treats Alzheimer’s with minimal toxicity, as well as finding a diagnostic blood test that can reliably identify lithium deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to how risk factors for diabetes or heart disease can show up in blood tests today, Yankner envisions a future where people can learn if they are at risk for Alzheimer’s from their annual physical with a primary care provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If one had a way of examining the lithium status of a person, that might dictate very early treatment,” Yankner said.&lt;/p&gt;

That glucose is released into your bloodstream. And insulin helps it move into your cells, where it gets used as energy. But when that final step doesn’t happen, glucose can build up in your bloodstream—causing you to have high blood sugar and experience hyperglycemia symptoms, which may be indicators of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/diabetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“High blood sugar—also called hyperglycemia—means there’s too much glucose in your bloodstream,” says &lt;a href="https://www.conference-board.org/bio/lisa-shah" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lisa Shah, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lisa Shah, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a physician who specializes in metabolic health. This typically happens because your body doesn’t produce insulin (&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20492087/difference-between-type-1-and-type-2-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 1 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;), doesn’t produce enough insulin (&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a21764231/type-2-diabetes-definition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;), or isn’t able to use insulin effectively (prediabetes and type 2 diabetes), she explains. But you can experience hyperglycemia even if you don’t have diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unifiedendocrinecare.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Chhaya Makhija, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chhaya Makhija, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, CEO, founder, and endocrinologist at Unified Endocrine and Diabetes Care; &lt;a href="https://www.conference-board.org/bio/lisa-shah" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lisa Shah, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lisa Shah, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, physician, executive vice president, and chief medical officer at &lt;a href="https://usa.twinhealth.com/company" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Twin Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Twin Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://aeroflowdiabetes.com/akhil-shenoy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Akhil Shenoy, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Akhil Shenoy, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, endocrinologist, internal medicine physician, and medical adviser at Aeroflow Diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When left untreated, high blood sugar can make you feel tired, weak, and dehydrated—and lead to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/g20481244/unexpected-side-effects-of-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:potentially life-threatening complications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;potentially life-threatening complications&lt;/a&gt;, like diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS)—more on these below. But you may not experience any symptoms at first, says &lt;a href="https://aeroflowdiabetes.com/akhil-shenoy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Akhil Shenoy, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Akhil Shenoy, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, endocrinologist and internal medicine physician. “Hyperglycemia doesn’t always feel obvious right away,” Dr. Shah explains. “The symptoms can be gradual and vague.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, experts recommend &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a40657574/diabetes-tests-diagnosis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:routine screening;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;routine screening&lt;/a&gt;—especially if you have risk factors for diabetes. Even if you don’t, you should keep an eye out for the following high blood sugar symptoms and get to a doctor if you experience several of them at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High blood sugar symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Frequent urination&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constantly running to the toilet? Hyperglycemia may be to blame. “When [your] blood sugar is high, your body works hard to bring it back into balance,” Dr. Shah says. Your kidneys go into overdrive trying to flush out that extra sugar. “Since the kidneys cannot simply push out solid sugar cubes, [they] draw water to go along with the sugar, leading to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65782866/reasons-you-always-have-to-pee/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:excessive urination;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;excessive urination&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Shenoy explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Increased thirst&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your body is a system. So as your kidneys work to get rid of that extra glucose—and as you start peeing more—you’ll also get thirstier. “The brain senses high glucose and signals you to drink more water,” Dr. Makhija explains. You might catch yourself reaching for your water bottle more often. You might also experience &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/a65870951/signs-of-dehydration/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dehydration symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dehydration symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, like weakness and dry mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fatigue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyperglycemia can make you feel weak, exhausted, and unlike your usual self. “You might feel tired, fatigued, or sluggish,” Dr. Shah says. “You might feel foggy or have a hard time concentrating on something.” In general, you’ll just feel “off,” she explains. And as time goes on, you might notice more obvious high blood sugar symptoms, like increased thirst and urination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Persistent hunger&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you have high blood sugar, glucose gets “stuck” in your bloodstream, Dr. Shenoy explains. “Meanwhile, the cells of the body—such as the brain, the heart, and the muscle cells—are not receiving the sugar that is needed for normal function,” he says. Your body may try to compensate by going into “starvation mode,” making you feel hungrier than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Weight loss&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood sugar can cause rapid, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/g20441544/losing-weight-without-trying/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:unexplained weight loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;unexplained weight loss&lt;/a&gt;—for a couple of different reasons. When your body can’t rely on glucose for energy, it starts burning fat and muscle instead, per the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-you-should-know-about-unexplained-weight-loss-and-diabetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This is an unhealthy type of weight loss,” Dr. Shenoy explains. Urinating more and dehydration can also contribute to weight loss, Dr. Makhija adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Blurry vision&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prolonged high glucose may &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/diabetes-and-your-eyes-what-you-need-to-know" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:damage blood vessels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;damage blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; and nerves throughout the body—including your eyes. The macula (a part of the eye) can swell due to leaky blood vessels (known as macular edema), resulting in blurry vision. While diabetic retinopathy tends to happen after very long periods of high blood sugars, causing leaking blood vessels or new abnormal ones to grow, this tends to lead to blindness. Again, that’s the worst-case scenario, and it often takes a while to occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyperglycemia may make your vision blurry, simply because it makes you dehydrated. “Dehydration affects the eyes, particularly the retinas, which have a rich blood supply,” Dr. Makhija says. When you’re low on fluids, your eyes may get blurry. This is usually a temporary condition. “[But] if sugars remain high for many years, the eye can be permanently damaged,” Dr. Shenoy explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Frequent infections&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic high blood sugar “impairs the immune response,” making it harder for your body to fight off infections, Dr. Makhija explains. And being dehydrated all the time certainly doesn’t help, she adds. Because of this, you may find yourself getting sick more often—and staying sick longer than you normally would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Slow-healing wounds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since hyperglycemia &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/poor-immune-response-impairs-diabetic-wound-healing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:impacts your immune response;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;impacts your immune response&lt;/a&gt;, it can also make it harder for your body to heal cuts and bruises. Chronic high blood sugar can also cause poor circulation and nerve damage, which can “reduce awareness of injury and delay healing,” compounding the problem, Dr. Makhija adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fruity breath&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fruity breath isn’t merely a sign of high blood sugar—it’s a symptom of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a dangerous hyperglycemia complication. When your body starts burning protein and fat for energy, it releases ketones, Dr. Makhija explains. One of these ketones, acetone, can make your breath smell fruity or metallic—and it’s a warning sign you need to see a doctor ASAP. Untreated DKA can lead to death, so head to the emergency room, stat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Confusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood sugar can cause fatigue and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a34600381/what-is-brain-fog/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain fog;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain fog&lt;/a&gt;. But if those symptoms become more severe—and you feel confused, disoriented, or delirious—you may need immediate medical care. These “changes in mental status” may be symptoms of DKA or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), potentially life-threatening hyperglycemia complications, per &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/hyperglycemia-symptoms-causes-treatments" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Yale Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Yale Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Upset stomach&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps are warning signs of DKA. When your body can’t rely on glucose for energy, it starts to burn fat and protein—and releases ketones in the process. As those ketones build up in your gastrointestinal tract, they can upset your stomach. “If you experience nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or mental fog, check your ketones and seek urgent care,” Dr. Makhija says. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cvs.com%2Fshop%2Fcvs-health-ketone-test-strips-50-ct-prodid-182676&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65901564%2Fsymptoms-high-blood-sugar%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ketone Sticks;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Ketone Sticks&lt;/a&gt; are over-the-counter test strips that detect ketones in the urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High blood sugar complications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though high blood sugar starts subtly, it can cause serious complications if left untreated. “You may not feel symptoms in the early stages, but long-term high blood sugar can quietly cause irreversible damage,” Dr. Makhija says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When glucose builds up in your bloodstream, it can damage your blood vessels—and subsequently your organs and nerves, Dr. Shenoy explains. Chronic high blood sugar can also lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), two serious complications that can cause coma, organ damage, and death in severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of high blood sugar that’s especially common in people with type 1 diabetes, explains Dr. Makhija. When your body can’t rely on glucose for energy, it starts breaking down fat and protein instead. “A byproduct of this process is ketones, which are acidic compounds that build up in the blood and make it dangerously acidic,” Dr. Shah says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21945-diabetic-ketoacidosis-dka" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/hyperglycemia-symptoms-causes-treatments" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Yale Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Yale Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, DKA symptoms may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frequent urination&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased thirst or dehydration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatigue or weakness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent hunger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fruity breath&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confusion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapid heart rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fainting or coma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When left untreated, DKA may cause a range of dangerous complications, including organ damage, coma, and even death, per the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21945-diabetic-ketoacidosis-dka" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “DKA is a life-threatening emergency and requires urgent treatment,” Dr. Makhija says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is another dangerous hyperglycemia complication, but it’s more common among people with type 2 diabetes, Dr. Makhija explains. When your blood sugar stays high for too long, it can cause extreme dehydration and confusion—without the excess ketones you see in DKA, Dr. Shenoy says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“HHS is similar [to DKA] in that blood sugar is extremely high, but your body produces enough insulin to prevent ketones from building up,” Dr. Shah says. “Instead, the problem is that the excess sugar makes your blood very concentrated. Your body then tries to dilute it by pulling water from elsewhere into the bloodstream, which exacerbates dehydration and throws off electrolyte balance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21147-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/hyperglycemia-symptoms-causes-treatments" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Yale Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Yale Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, HHS symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A routine blood test (or even a finger prick) can give your doctor insight into your levels. The good news, when caught early, there are many medications available (from &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a41994246/ozempic-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ozempic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; to full-on insulin) to help manage blood sugars. If you have the symptoms on this list or are simply concerned that your blood sugar is high, ask your healthcare provider about next steps. If you believe you are experiencing DKA or HHS, seek immediate treatment. In severe cases, these conditions may cause seizures, organ damage, coma, and death. “If symptoms escalate or you’re unsure, call 911 or go to the emergency room,” Dr. Makhija says. “DKA and HHS are not manageable at home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 20:19:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTFByUXk4SVlta0NNclVhTVdvWmdJRnl1c3dLRG9FRTNJdXY4eExKNHhhM2VUckIxSmZ5c3FSaTlNQWhUTVBERGdCTWgxNFQ1XzZWQnlkVjBtTGFteVpvS2FRSUE2bUtPTTI4eF9YTmNYTV8zOWc</guid></item><item><title>公共卫生部新闻稿清单-洛杉矶县公共卫生部（ .gov ）</title><link>http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubhpdetail.cfm?prid=5125</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="container-xl p-4"&gt;

							&lt;h1 class="h3"&gt;Public Health Reporting an Increase in Flea-Borne Typhus Cases in Los 
Angeles County - People urged to take precautions to protect 
themselves and their pets 
							&lt;/h1&gt;
				&lt;/p&gt;							
			&lt;p&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is urging people to take precautions following an increase of flea-borne typhus cases across the County. Earlier this year, Public Health investigated a localized outbreak of flea-borne typhus in Central Los Angeles and is currently investigating a second outbreak in the City of Santa Monica.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flea-borne typhus cases have been rising in Los Angeles County since 2010. In 2024, a record 187 cases were identified. So far in 2025, 106 cases have already been reported, higher than this time last year. Public Health expects additional cases and clusters to appear in the coming months, as flea-borne typhus infections peak in late summer and fall.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This ongoing increase in flea-borne typhus highlights the importance of taking preventive steps to reduce the risk of infection,” said Muntu Davis, MD, MPH, Los Angeles County Health Officer.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Flea-Borne Typhus (Typhus)? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typhus is an acute febrile illness caused by &lt;em&gt;Rickettsia Typhi&lt;/em&gt; bacteria, which is spread by infected fleas. People can become infected when flea feces are rubbed into cuts or scrapes on the skin or rubbed into the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Los Angeles County, infected fleas are most commonly found on rats, free-roaming cats, and opossums. Pets such as dogs and cats that go outdoors can bring fleas into and around your home. Infected animals typically do not show signs of illness. Flea-borne typhus is not spread from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Flea-borne typhus is serious, but preventable,” said Dr. Davis. “We urge people to take precautions by using flea control on their pets, avoiding contact with stray animals, and preventing wildlife from living in or next to their home or property. If you develop symptoms, such as fever, chills, or a rash, seek medical attention right away.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Prevent Flea-Borne Typhus:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Health encourages people to follow these preventive steps to the risk of flea-borne typhus infections:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· &lt;strong&gt;Keep fleas off you and your pets.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o When outside, use EPA-registered insect repellent labeled for protection against fleas.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o Routinely use flea control products on your pets.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o Keep pets indoors as much as possible.  &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· &lt;strong&gt;Avoid attracting wild or stray animals.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o Don’t leave pet food or water outside. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o Don’t feed or touch stray or wild animals.  &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o Keep your yard free of debris and overgrown plants.  &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o Store trash in containers with tightly fitting lids.  &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o Close off crawl spaces and seal any openings where animals could enter, hide, or find food and water.  &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;o Report stray animals or signs of rodents or opossums near your property to local animal control officials. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;

The ACIP will also provide updates on its work groups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But in a new development today spurred by recent upheaval at the CDC, a US senator is calling for the meeting to be postponed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A different ACIP&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The meeting is the second of the newly reconstituted ACIP, which now includes seven members handpicked by Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who fired the 17 sitting members of the group in June. Several of the new members of the group share Kennedy's anti-vaccine views. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/newly-appointed-cdc-vaccine-advisory-committee-holds-first-meeting-stirs-more-controversy"&gt;&lt;span&gt;June meeting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the new members announced their intention to revisit recommendations for the hepatitis B and MMRV vaccines, both of which are recommended for young children (MMRV is a combination of the measles and chickenpox vaccines; the CDC recommends the first doses of the two vaccines be administered separately, while MMRV is the preferred option for the second dose). That announcement, along with the recommendation that Americans receive flu vaccines only in single doses that don't contain thimerosal, were questioned by public health and infectious disease experts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The meeting comes amid chaos at the CDC, largely revolving around vaccine recommendations. CDC Director Susan Monarez, PhD, was fired yesterday by the White House after refusing to meet demands from Kennedy that she accept ACIP recommendations and fire staff, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/28/health/rfk-jr-susan-monarez-cdc-vaccines.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;media reports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. While the CDC director isn't legally bound to accept ACIP recommendations, they typically do. Monarez's ouster was followed by the resignation of three top CDC officials (see CIDRAP News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/public-health/cdc-director-fired-after-she-refused-rubber-stamp-kennedys-vaccine-directives"&gt;&lt;span&gt;story&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The discussions and possible vote on COVID-19 vaccine recommendations are among those that will be closely watched. Current &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;CDC guidelines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; recommend COVID vaccines for most adults ages 18 and older, and for children ages 6 to 17 based on discussions with a healthcare provider. But Kennedy announced in June that COVID vaccines were no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women, and the Food and Drug Administration yesterday released &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/fda-oks-updated-covid-vaccines-places-limits-kids-adults"&gt;&lt;span&gt;narrower approvals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for updated COVID shots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cassidy: developments and scientific lapses require oversight&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/rep/newsroom/press/cassidy-calls-for-vaccine-committee-meeting-to-be-postponed-following-cdc-departures"&gt;&lt;span&gt;statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; released today by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), who heads the committee and was instrumental in Kennedy's confirmation to be HHS Secretary, called for the ACIP meeting to be postponed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Serious allegations have been made about the meeting agenda, membership, and lack of scientific process being followed for the now announced September ACIP meeting,” Cassidy said. "These decisions directly impact children’s health and the meeting should not occur until significant oversight has been conducted. If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cassidy, a physician by training, has long been a proponent of vaccines. When he announced his support for Kennedy's confirmation, Cassidy said that Kennedy had agreed to maintain ACIP recommendations without changes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
