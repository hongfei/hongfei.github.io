                            &lt;p&gt;The US Department of Health and Human Services yesterday &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/us/american-politics/article/tylenol-autism-trump-rfk-pregnant-fever-n0w3fv7t0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that pregnant women should avoid acetaminophen — known in Britain as paracetamol, and the active ingredient in Tylenol — because of concerns it may increase the risk of autism in unborn children. But millions of mothers use paracetamol to manage pain and fevers during their pregnancies because it’s the only drug available to them to safely do so. Or at least, that’s what they’ve been told for the past few decades, but apparently no longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent1" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HHS’ rationale for the new Tylenol warning is based on a systematic review led by Harvard Dean of Public Health Andrea Baccarelli. Dr. Baccarelli’s &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/autism-announcement-fact-sheet.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; contends that there is a “strong, consistent association between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and ADHD/ASD/other NDDs”. The review emphasised that this result was exceptionally robust, that it stood strong in studies controlling for bundles of different confounders, with negative control exposure periods, and with propensity score matching. The only problem is that &lt;a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/you-cant-just-control-for-things" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;none of these methods&lt;/a&gt; are reliable and the authors actually ignored some good evidence that contradicts their conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main failing point of the review is that its authors knew about good evidence in the form of &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406"&gt;sibling control studies&lt;/a&gt; — studies where scientists compare a sibling who is exposed to Tylenol &lt;i&gt;in utero &lt;/i&gt;to a sibling who wasn’t exposed to it — and they ignored those results. But those studies were the strongest; it just happens to be the case that those studies didn’t find anything alarming. To me, that seems like the correct explanation for why the authors were &lt;a href="https://www.cremieux.xyz/i/174283509/does-tylenol-cause-autism" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;so gung-ho&lt;/a&gt; to attack them on spurious grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the largest, highest-quality &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2817406" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used almost 2.5 million births from Sweden between 1995 and 2019, used great measures of Tylenol exposure in a country where most Tylenol use is &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bcpt.13003" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;by prescription&lt;/a&gt;, and they found much the same as the other non-causal studies: mothers who used more Tylenol during pregnancy have children with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders more often. But they went further than replicating that purely correlational association. In fact, they showed that, when comparing differentially exposed siblings, the one exposed to Tylenol was no more likely to have any disorder than the one who was not exposed. In other words, the association isn’t causal at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="94" data-end="388"&gt;The review was plagued by non-sequiturs. It cited weak evidence as if it were strong. The authors failed to quantitatively synthesise the findings of the studies they referenced. Worse, they botched the table entries and even cited studies in ways directly contradicted by the studies themselves. The review was lazy, but it ostensibly supports what some people really want to believe: that Tylenol causes autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this bastardised faux-science masquerading as real information, millions of pregnant women will be scared into avoiding Tylenol or any brand of paracetamol, even when it might be the drug they need. Mothers who need to break a fever or manage pain have no alternatives: opiates aren’t acceptable, and Ibuprofen isn’t safe before foetuses have undergone about two trimesters of growth. If it were true that Tylenol is causing autism, then there might be some debate to be had about the risk-reward calculus for letting pregnant women use it, but there isn’t. The science is abundantly clear: Tylenol &lt;i&gt;does not &lt;/i&gt;cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent2" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our public health authorities get scientific questions wrong, suffering follows. Who will cry out for the mothers?&lt;/p&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;That is one reason, aside from cultural and religious considerations, some people kick off their shoes at the door. But while gross, the germs on your shoes are unlikely to cause illness, some experts said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In a small, widely cited study, researchers found that fecal bacteria such as &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, which can make you sick if they are ingested or make their way into a cut in your skin, were commonly present on the bottoms of shoes. And when those shoes came into contact with clean flooring, 90-99 percent of the bacteria were transferred to it. (The study was not peer reviewed and was funded by a shoe company marketing washable shoes.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The first three or four steps when you walk in the house are the most contaminated on the floor because you’re bringing all that stuff from outside and walking on the floors,” said Charles Gerba, a professor of microbiology at the University of Arizona and co-author of the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Other studies have reported that &lt;i&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/i&gt;, a bacterium that can cause severe diarrhea, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) can also be found on the bottoms of shoes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We live in a germy world,” and bacteria and viruses can be found on nearly any object, including our shoes, said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases and preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. But there aren’t any instances in the scientific literature of pathogens being transmitted from the soles of shoes to noses or mouths in high enough numbers to initiate infections, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“That’s why we don’t have public health recommendations that people sanitize their shoes,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Schaffner, who sometimes wears street shoes in his own home, said it is more notable that “our hands can pick up germs, and then we touch our mouths, noses and eyes. That’s the mode of inoculation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Going shoeless at home has another benefit, some experts said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;When you wear shoes all the time, it may lead to deconditioning of the deeper muscles of the foot, said Amiethab Aiyer, an orthopedic surgeon specializing in foot and ankle conditions at Johns Hopkins. “Their relative strength and relative conditioning could lapse over time,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“From the perspective of maintaining strength and conditioning of the musculature in the feet, and to avoid the germ elements, it may be helpful to not wear shoes around the house,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;From a cultural perspective, Aiyer, who is Indian American, said he and his family do not wear shoes in the house, both for cleanliness and out of respect for the home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;However, some people shouldn’t go barefoot at home. For example, if you have poor circulation or conditions such as neuropathy, which is nerve damage in the feet that can be caused by diabetes or chemotherapy, it can lead to the loss of protective sensation that may affect your ability to detect objects under foot, Aiyer said. Additionally, people who are at increased risk of falling may need traction or improved perceived balance that shoes can provide, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h3 id="what_else_you_should_know" class="heading | bold font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile

However, if you are concerned about dirt or germs, here are tips from experts:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list |  list_unstyled list_counter_reset unordered font_size_18"&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hand-wash shoes with soap and warm water to remove dirt and debris, particularly from the soles of shoes. Mix water with a small amount of dish soap and a washing powder (sodium carbonate), and give the bottoms “a good thorough scrub with a strong bristle brush,” said Zachary Pozniak, co-owner of Jeeves New York, a dry cleaning and shoe cleaning and repair service. Insoles that are removable can be handwashed and air-dried before placing them back in the shoe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Disinfect the soles with a spray or wipe to help kill germs. Look for products registered with the Environmental Protection Agency to kill particular pathogens such as norovirus, a highly contagious germ that can cause severe gastrointestinal illness. For better control when using disinfectant sprays, spray a clean towel with the solution and wipe the soles of the shoes rather than spraying directly onto the shoe, Pozniak said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Machine wash shoes only when the manufacturer label states so. Before washing shoes in the machine, pretreat stains by hand in the sink, Pozniak said. Do not wash materials such as leather or suede.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Air dry unless otherwise specified by the manufacturer.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Clothes dryers can ruin shoes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The bottom line: Our shoes can carry germs into the house, but they alone are unlikely to cause illness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Boston Globe</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 18:33:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTFBxY19mS05OOXcyRC1tZl9vMS1HQ0VmWXJXdk41VVdySTVBdFRpaHl6eW5xVnpuR2hQd1Fsd3JCVUl5UjZfTDR5c09vbGktTy1jRV9SNmFySGg4a2FyMC0xWDdhMlVKT1hCMEI0a2xOTGtDZUVONXY0</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心的研究人员表示，美国的耐药“噩梦细菌”病例正在上升-哥伦比亚广播公司新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nightmare-bacteria-drug-resistant-cases-increase-cdc-report/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Infection rates from drug-resistant "nightmare bacteria" rose almost 70% between 2019 and 2023, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02404" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria that are difficult to treat due to the so-called NDM gene primarily drove the increase, CDC researchers wrote in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02404" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;an article published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome," said David Weiss, an Emory University infectious diseases researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may play out in doctors' offices across the country, as infections long considered routine and easy to treat — like urinary tract infections — could become chronic problems, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report's authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/drug-resistant-infections-new-antibiotics-needed-high-cost-preventing-development/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise — unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn't kill the germs made them stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to "&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/could-antibiotic-resistant-superbugs-become-a-bigger-killer-than-cancer-60-minutes-2019-04-21/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;nightmare bacteria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. That includes carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers drew data from 29 states that do the necessary testing and reporting of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 — an increase of 69%. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 — an increase of 460%, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A researcher not involved in the study said the increase is probably related to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that there was a huge surge in antibiotic use during the pandemic, so this likely is reflected in increasing drug resistance," said Dr. Jason Burnham, a Washington University researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC's count is only a partial picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many states are not fully testing and reporting cases. Even in states that do, cases tend to be among hospital patients sick enough to warrant special testing. Many hospitals also aren't able to do the testing needed to detect certain forms of genetic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers did not have data from some of the most populous states, including California, Florida, New York and Texas, which means the absolute number of U.S. infections "is definitely underestimated," Burnham said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first study to report a rise. A CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7423a2.htm" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published in June noted an increase in NDM cases in New York City between 2019 and 2024. &lt;/p&gt;

But one reported infection in the Bear River Health Department district, which encompasses Box Elder, Cache and Rich counties, shows the highly contagious disease has spread north months after the outbreak began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Officials say people in the area may have been exposed to the virus at the Chick-fil-A off of State Road 165 in Providence, in Cache County, if they were there between 6:30-9 p.m. on Sep. 11. Those at the Budge Clinic, 1350 N 500 East in Logan, between 3-6:30 p.m. on Sep. 15 may have also been exposed, according to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The department says those exposed at&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the restaurant should watch for symptoms — like a high fever and cough, or a rash — through Oct. 2, and those exposed at the clinic should be on the lookout through Oct. 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Cache County is the fourth county that the department has confirmed cases in during the current outbreak, which began in June with a single&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;case in Utah County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Of the confirmed measles cases, 25 have been in the Southwest Utah district (consisting of Beaver, Garfield, Iron, Kane and Washington Counties), three in the Southeast district (Carbon, Emery, Grand and San Juan counties), seven in Utah County and one in the Bear River district, according to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Three of those districts — Bear River, Utah County and Southwest Utah — have also seen &lt;a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/09/19/measles-found-utah-wastewater/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/09/19/measles-found-utah-wastewater/"&gt;measles in their wastewater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;within the past month, the health department reports. These other districts without confirmed cases have also found measles in sewage:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Davis County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Salt Lake County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summit County&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TriCounty, which consists of Daggett, Duchesne and Uintah counties&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Wastewater in the Central Utah and the San Juan districts has not been tested, according to the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Dr. Leisha Nolen, the state’s epidemiologist, said the wastewater&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;results mean people should be aware that measles could be found in areas of the state without confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;There are active symptom watches in effect for those who visited the Chick-fil-A and clinic in Cache County, as well as for individuals who were at Water Canyon High School, in Hildale in Washington County, on Sep. 3. That watch in southern Utah ends Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;As of Sep. 16, there were 1,491 confirmed measles cases in 42 jurisdictions across the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt; Last year, the CDC says the U.S. saw only 285 cases. Weekly cases throughout the nation spiked this year in March, according to CDC data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Measles symptoms typically appear within one to two weeks of exposure, according to the health department, and can consist of a high fever and cough, runny nose or red eyes. After four days of fever, the department says a rash will normally appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Those who develop symptoms should stay away from other people and call their healthcare provider before going to their doctor, the health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The best way to prevent measles, according to the health department, is to get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine from their healthcare provider. The vaccine is 97% effective in people who receive two doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 17:57:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE4zNEdzQ1RteEZ1ZjhmcFozODIybEhlOG9OZFJsNjg5OF9XYUxRQXJjYUtzZEQyU3Bac2daLXF5NFNPLUhSM01jMlI0RF90SW1rcG15U0ZyRm9vd2gzME9QQjdLN0tiYnBLb0NRd04tMXhzWm40am00cmdROA</guid></item><item><title>什么是“复古漫步” ？最新的趋势专家说，可以预防痴呆症-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15125737/retro-walking-trend-prevent-dementia-cognition-ucla.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Leading doctors are highlighting how an unusual walking technique could help boost memory and stave off dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-c6f67260-989e-11f0-891b-c9d2a3dca2d6"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/los-angeles/index.html" id="mol-c6f70ea0-989e-11f0-891b-c9d2a3dca2d6"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; Drs Eve Glazier and Elizabeth Ko say that multiple studies have shown that walking backwards, or 'retro walking', may improve cognition and boost activity in the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain responsible for decision-making, problem-solving and working memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They write: 'That is the region of the brain associated with problem-solving, logic and making decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In one particularly intriguing study, participants who simply visualized the act of walking backward, but were actually sitting still, improved their scores on a memory test.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact scientific mechanism behind how retro walking improves cognition isn't fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, researchers hypothesize it is linked to the brain working harder or in a more complex way to process and carry out the unfamiliar movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have shown benefits from as little as 10 to 15 minutes of daily backward walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Glazier and Dr Ko note that caution is needed to avoid injury due to potential balance issues or obstacles that are tricky to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Eve Glazier and Dr Elizabeth Ko who are based at UCLA in California say that multiple studies have shown how walking backwards, or 'retro walking', may improve cognition and boost activity in the prefrontal cortex&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/walking-backward-may-have-link-increased-cognition"&gt;advise&lt;/a&gt; walking on a treadmill instead of walking freely indoors or outdoors as the machine gives you a 'stable base' and 'allows you to set a steady and controlled speed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you don't have access to a treadmill, the health experts recommend working with a partner who can guide you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://file///C:/Users/sadie.whitelocks/Downloads/EmergingTrendsinPharmaceuticalScienceResearchVolumeIV.pdf"&gt;2025 study &lt;/a&gt;out of Dayananda Sagar University in India, researchers found that retro walking had a significant impact on cognitive ability. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;For the investigation, 36 participants aged 65 to 75 were recruited and underwent retro walking training three times a week for six weeks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Each exercise session lasted 30 minutes and they included four-minute retro-walking sets with five-minute rest intervals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Under professional supervision, participants walked backward on a flat surface, maintaining a steady pace to prevent falls. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The intensity was progressively increased as they gained confidence and proficiency. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, they were encouraged to continue the practice outside of the supervised sessions on their own at home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a 2025 study out of Dayananda Sagar University in India, researchers found that retro walking had a significant impact on cognitive ability (training using marked pathways shown above)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the end of the study, tests for cognition were repeated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale, which assesses various cognitive domains, including memory, attention, language, and executive functions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The MoCA score ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating better cognitive performance. At the end of the study, the average score increased by almost three points, from 25 pre-test to 27.7 post-test. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A score of 25 indicates that further assessments are required and a person may have mild cognitive impairment, a precursor to dementia. A score of 27 or higher is considered normal or healthy with no signs of cognitive decline.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers concluded: 'Cognitive decline is a major concern in the geriatric population, with physical exercise being a well-established intervention for cognitive preservation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'The significant improvement in MoCA scores from pre-test to post-test suggests that retro-walking positively influences cognitive function. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Previous research has indicated that engaging in dual-task exercises, such as walking while maintaining balance, stimulates cognitive processing and enhances executive function. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Retro-walking demands increased attention and coordination, potentially explaining the observed cognitive improvements.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers also highlight that cognitive impairment is becoming more common among older adults, driven by the aging global population and the increasing prevalence of age-related neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common forms of dementia and mostly affects adults over the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;About 7million people in the US 65 and older live with the condition, and over 100,000 die from it annually. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Alzheimer's Association estimates that by 2050, nearly 13 million Americans will be living with the disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with having a beneficial effect on cognitive health, retro walking has also been found to have many other benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Glazier and Dr Ko wrote: '&lt;span&gt;It can strengthen the muscles in the back; increase strength and flexibility in the hamstrings; strengthen the ankles; improve balance, posture and coordination; and even ease lower back pain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Due to a decreased range of motion in the knees and hips, retro walking can be kinder to those joints.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Walking backward can also increase the energy you use by 40 percent, upping calorie burn. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And without being able to see in front of you, your body has to rely more on something called proprioception, the built-in sense of where you are in space. This can fine turn coordination and stability and strengthen your ability to focus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Better stability and balance is crucial in older adults as it can prevent falls and the potentially deadly complications that result.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Detailing his top five health hacks for helping to slow down aging in his brain and hopefully reduce his risk of dementia, Bain-Kim, who founded the start-up Lifeforce, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-startup-founder-habits-to-protect-brain-aging-alzheimers-2025-9"&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt; he relies on specific diets and workouts, as well as supplements and sound sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regular exercise boosts blood flow to the brain to help clear out substances that could cause dementia, and quality sleep can also help the brain clear out potentially harmful deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And research has shown that certain diets or lifestyle habits can also boost brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Below, Daily Mail details the longevity expert's top tips:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;CREATINE SUPPLEMENTS &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Creatine, long popular with bodybuilders, is now attracting fans looking to boost their cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The supplement is made from three amino acids, glycine, arginine and methionine,  and provides extra fuel to boost muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But studies suggest that this extra fuel could also be used by the brain, with the energy potentially helping to fend off cognitive decline and protect against stress caused by sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40395689/"&gt;2025 study&lt;/a&gt; found dementia patients who took 20 grams of creatine a day for eight weeks had a slight increase in cognitive function compared to those who did not take the supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bain-Kim believes that people already take far too many supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But amid its potential brain health effects, he said he added this supplement to his daily routine because he felt it might help to lower his risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Creatine is widely available in powder and pill forms, with users advised to take around three to five grams per day. One serving costs as little as 30 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The FDA does not regulate creatine supplements, and experts urge people to buy the supplement from a reputable source to reduce the risk of it also containing impurities or ingredients that could be harmful to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In previous cases, some creatine supplements have been&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://goliathlabs.com/blogs/articles/does-creatine-have-lead?srsltid=AfmBOoon6xbI3QoKZnvT83tXUZJvLhETvj85ggEQbljcBUpxv-ib4gRu"&gt; found to contain&lt;/a&gt; trace amounts of lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And people with kidney disease, affecting about 37million Americans, are advised to consult with their doctor before taking the supplement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a stock image of Ozempic.

This means that a 30-year-old has a maximum heart rate of 190 beats per minute and a Zone 2 heart rate of around 113 to 132 beats per minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;FOLLOW THE 'MIND' DIET&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have touted the Mediterranean diet as a way to boost cognitive health for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Bain-Kim says he recently switched to the Mediterranean-Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet, or the MIND diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MIND is an eating plan developed by Harvard researchers to slow cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some research has suggested it can slow decline, including a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4581900/"&gt;2015 study&lt;/a&gt; on 1,000 adults that showed slower cognitive decline among those on the diet compared to those not on the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2302368"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; on the diet that tracked 2,000 cognitively unimpaired people for three years found no significant differences in cognitive function or brain size between those on and not on the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The MIND diet emphasizes fibers and healthy fats such as omega-3s that can support brain health by helping the brain form and maintain cell membranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The diet consists of at least six servings of leafy greens, at least five servings of nuts, at least four of beans, two or more servings of berries and one serving of fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel or sardines per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those on the diet also use olive oil as their primary cooking oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say this diet may reduce the risk of dementia by cutting inflammation levels and improving the health of blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;MORE QUALITY SLEEP&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sleep is also being touted as a way to prevent dementia, with experts saying it can also remove potentially dangerous toxins from the brain (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sleep has recently become the cornerstone of every 'longevity athlete's' fitness plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Bain-Kim is no exception, saying that for peak health and performance he tries to sleep about seven hours and 45 minutes every night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This tracks with the CDC's recommendation, which states everyone needs between seven and nine hours every night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Everyone appreciates a good night's sleep, but for me that's now core to my strategy because of the brain protection benefits of getting enough sleep,' he told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's become the non-negotiable for me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts suggest sleep can help ward off dementia by allowing the brain to clear harmful proteins, such as beta-amyloid, which build up in the organ during waking hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://theconversation.com/poor-sleep-may-nudge-the-brain-toward-dementia-researchers-find-265216"&gt;study found this month&lt;/a&gt; that people suffering from chronic insomnia, or struggling to sleep, were twice as likely to develop dementia as healthy adults who slept normally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — Infection rates from drug-resistant “nightmare bacteria” rose almost 70% between 2019 and 2023, according to a new &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02404" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria that are difficult to treat due to the so-called NDM gene primarily drove the increase, CDC researchers wrote in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://doi.org/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02404" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an article published Monday&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome,” said David Weiss, an Emory University infectious diseases researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;It’s likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may play out in doctors’ offices across the country, as infections long considered routine and easy to treat — like urinary tract infections — could become chronic problems, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report’s authors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial resistance occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise — unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn’t kill the germs made them stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to “ &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/afcee30eb24848d38f9b855fbcc9a4ba"&gt;nightmare bacteria&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ” resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. That includes carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers drew data from 29 states that do the necessary testing and reporting of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;They counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 — an increase of 69%. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 — an increase of 460%, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A researcher not involved in the study said the increase is probably related to the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/covid-19-pandemic"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that there was a huge surge in antibiotic use during the pandemic, so this likely is reflected in increasing drug resistance,” said Dr. Jason Burnham, a Washington University researcher, in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s count is only a partial picture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many states are not fully testing and reporting cases. Even in states that do, cases tend to be among hospital patients sick enough to warrant special testing. Many hospitals also aren’t able to do the testing needed to detect certain forms of genetic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC researchers did not have data from some of the most populous states, including California, Florida, New York and Texas, which means the absolute number of U.S. infections “is definitely underestimated,” Burnham said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first study to report a rise. A CDC &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7423a2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; published in June noted an increase in NDM cases in New York City between 2019 and 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

They found that millennials — born between 1981 and 1996 — appear to be aging biologically faster than previous generations, based on biomarkers in blood that indicate the health of various organs. That acceleration was associated with a significantly increased risk — up to 42 percent — for certain cancers, especially those of the lung, gastrointestinal tract and uterus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="4NBOJB3KZ5CCPLZUPDG3XKRWNQ" data-contentid="4NBOJB3KZ5CCPLZUPDG3XKRWNQ" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idwISdm-css"&gt;Much of the work in this area is in its early stages and has not proved a direct cause and effect in humans. The evidence comes from epidemiological studies, which look at patterns of disease in large populations; observational studies, which track people’s behaviors and exposures without intervening; and animal models which are sometimes, but not always, good proxies for people. Such research is difficult to interpret and especially prone to overstatement or misreading of the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="Ad" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Ad/Ad.js" data-style="stitches" class="wpds-c-PJLV"&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV PJLV-icAbLfl-css"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-lg mt-lg pt-md pb-md"&gt;&lt;div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"&gt;&lt;p class="dib flex divider gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="LVWUOP2BZJB3XK2BPCT4RWXITU" data-contentid="LVWUOP2BZJB3XK2BPCT4RWXITU" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idwISdm-css"&gt;John Ioannidis, a professor of medicine, epidemiology and population health at Stanford University, said research that searches for correlations across large datasets is highly susceptible to producing spurious results.

Women giving birth in the second half of the 20th century were treated with drugs not as an exception, but a new standard.

However, as researchers revisit this era with new methods and by examining how events unfolded over an extended period&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;— and with the discovery of the link between morning sickness drug thalidomide and birth defects in the 1960s — a more complicated story has emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="Ad" data-file="custom-template-components/src/Ad/Ad.js" data-style="stitches" class="wpds-c-PJLV"&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV PJLV-icAbLfl-css"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-lg mt-lg pt-md pb-md"&gt;&lt;div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"&gt;&lt;p class="dib flex divider gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="RQBY262QMJAIVA4655BPD7APV4" data-contentid="RQBY262QMJAIVA4655BPD7APV4" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idwISdm-css"&gt;What if a drug’s real risk may not be apparent in the days or weeks after birth, but only show years — or possibly decades — later?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7CDNC2RQ6JGE7EMA7F3OP3QJX4" data-contentid="7CDNC2RQ6JGE7EMA7F3OP3QJX4" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idwISdm-css"&gt;Caitlin Murphy, a professor and cancer epidemiologist at the University of Chicago, found herself wrestling with exactly this question.

A panel of experts published a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/series-do/alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.thelancet.com/series-do/alzheimers-disease"&gt;series of articles in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Monday detailing these advances, while also addressing the major controversy surrounding the new treatments — the first to alter the course of the disease, but criticized for being expensive, having side effects, and showing only modest efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Juan Fortea, head of the Neurobiology of Dementia group at the Sant Pau Research Institute and co-author of one of the &lt;i&gt;Lancet&lt;/i&gt; articles, says Alzheimer’s research is at a “paradigm shift.” “We are not curing the disease,” he clarifies, “but it is the first time in human history that we have managed to slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The driving force behind this scientific turning point is a &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2024-01-29/merce-boada-neurologist-the-more-we-learn-about-alzheimers-the-more-able-we-will-be-to-decide-when-we-want-to-stop-living-this-way.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2024-01-29/merce-boada-neurologist-the-more-we-learn-about-alzheimers-the-more-able-we-will-be-to-decide-when-we-want-to-stop-living-this-way.html"&gt;new generation of drugs&lt;/a&gt; that eliminate beta-amyloid protein, which accumulates in diseased brains, and slow disease progression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Albert Lleó, head of Neurology at Sant Pau in Barcelona, emphasizes that this is just “the beginning of the journey”: “There are 138 more drugs under investigation. These are the first of many to come.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Researchers are also exploring, for example, the potential of semaglutide, which has already revolutionized obesity treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The drugs that have raised all hopes are called lecanemab and donanemab. In clinical trials, the first slowed disease progression by 27%, and the second by 35%. Both are approved in the United States and other countries, but the European Medicines Agency (EMA), more conservative, &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-09-25/a-scientific-rebellion-to-get-europe-to-approve-a-controversial-alzheimers-drug.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-09-25/a-scientific-rebellion-to-get-europe-to-approve-a-controversial-alzheimers-drug.html"&gt;took time to approve lecanemab&lt;/a&gt; (giving approval a year ago after initially rejecting it) and is still reviewing donanemab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Both drugs have been surrounded by controversy, even within the scientific community. First, because of &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-08-06/discovery-of-lithiums-essential-role-in-alzheimers-disease-opens-a-hopeful-avenue-for-treatment.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-08-06/discovery-of-lithiums-essential-role-in-alzheimers-disease-opens-a-hopeful-avenue-for-treatment.html"&gt;potential side effects&lt;/a&gt; — for example, lecanemab has been linked to cerebral hemorrhages and the deaths of two patients — but also because of doubts about the clinical benefit: what does reducing disease progression by 27% really mean for a family’s day-to-day life? Other concerns include the price (estimated at around $25,000 per patient per year) and the fact that the drugs are only intended for very specific patients in the very early stages of the disease, with specific characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;In the &lt;i&gt;Lancet&lt;/i&gt; series, the authors — some of whom disclosed conflicts of interest due to ties with the pharmaceutical companies producing these drugs — analyze this “range of reactions” and the “skepticism” these drugs generated in the scientific community, asking whether the same would have happened with other diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;They even compare efficacy, cost, and impact of the new Alzheimer’s drugs with those of other biologic drugs for different conditions. For instance, with lecanemab and donanemab, serious adverse effects occurred in 1 in 300 and 1 in 65 patients, respectively; but in trials of pembrolizumab (an immunotherapy) for lung cancer, side effects occurred in 27% of cases. Another comparison: the reduction in disability from anti-amyloid drugs in Alzheimer’s is similar to that observed in trials of biologic drugs for rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Based on the history of other biologic drugs in different diseases, the authors argue that the magnitude of effect may be very similar. In those cases, they note, prices were also high and the drugs were not free of side effects. Regarding the limited access to a very specific group of patients — experts estimate that for now only 5% of people with Alzheimer’s will benefit — the authors point out that in multiple sclerosis, for example, the use of innovative drugs was limited to 36% of patients in 2017 and rose to 74% in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“What these authors are putting forward isn’t a direct comparison with other diseases, but rather a demonstration that there are other therapies in medicine that have a comparable magnitude of effect, but Alzheimer’s has characteristics that undervalue these advances,” says David Pérez, head of Neurology at the 12 de Octubre Hospital in Madrid, who was not involved in this series. He refers to a handful of factors, ranging from scientific skepticism to social prejudices, which have created a climate conducive to controversy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Pérez notes, for example, that the history of Alzheimer’s drug development has been “bumpy,” marked by successive failures that planted a seed of distrust in the scientific community. The controversy over aducanumab, a drug approved in the U.S. under controversial circumstances but which failed commercially and was later withdrawn by the manufacturer, did not help. “It was approved in a twisted way, without clear benefit, and that generated an atmosphere of mistrust,” Pérez explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;Nihilism and ageism&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;There is also “a lot of nihilism” surrounding this disease, says Lleó: “Many times, the diagnosis is not made accurately, and since there is no treatment, the public feels no need to demand a diagnosis or timelines the way they do for stroke or cancer. Sometimes, the symptoms are considered part of normal aging. All of this contributes to the perception of a disease in which there is little that can be done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Another factor affecting the debate, according to Pérez, is ageism: “This is a disease that primarily affects older people, who cannot raise their voices and demand anything from society. These patients are a vulnerable group.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The scale of the disease, the experts consulted add, has also fueled doubts at the policy and regulatory level. “If it weren’t such a prevalent disease, if it didn’t cause a strain on the healthcare system, on costs, and on procedural changes, some of the controversy wouldn’t have arisen. If it were a rare disease, we have little doubt that this would have been approved without any controversy and very quickly,” Fortea says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;This first generation of drugs presents a &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-06-25/searching-for-an-alzheimers-cure-in-a-chickens-eye.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2025-06-25/searching-for-an-alzheimers-cure-in-a-chickens-eye.html"&gt;challenge for healthcare systems&lt;/a&gt;. Both in identifying patients who can benefit — which requires diagnostic and biomarker tests to confirm the disease, as well as genetic studies to rule out incompatible mutations — and in the treatment and follow-up itself: the therapy is intravenous, administered in a day hospital, and requires regular MRIs to monitor for potential hemorrhages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“Seeing patients in outpatient consultations, once every six months or once a year, is one thing; lecanemab treatment is another. It involves infusions every two weeks in a day hospital, plus four MRIs per year and numerous visits… A patient goes from one or two relatively short visits per year to 24, 30, or 35 visits. Imagine the workload this represents. It will be challenging for the system to adapt, but since it will [initially] involve only a minority of patients, the system can gradually adjust,” Fortea says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The experts consulted emphasize that potential side effects are manageable. Regarding clinical benefit, Fortea notes that “that 30% translates into the patient gaining six months over 18 months.” In other words: “To progress to the next phase, you progress 30% more slowly. You maintain more autonomy and quality of life because we are slowing a disease that causes significant disability. We are not curing the disease. Patients get worse, but at a slower pace,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;In an interview with EL PAÍS, Cristina Maragall, president of the Pasqual Maragall Foundation, argued that for both the scientific community and families, “it is essential that these medications begin to be used.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;Diagnostic revolution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Therapeutic advances, however, are only one part of this scientific transformation shaking up Alzheimer’s research. The other pillar — diagnostics — is also advancing by leaps and bounds, particularly with the development of biomarkers that identify biological traces of the disease ever earlier. The authors estimate that the arrival of plasma biomarkers, which detect traces of the disease in the blood — with a &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-04-09/new-method-detects-alzheimers-in-people-with-symptoms-using-a-blood-test.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-04-09/new-method-detects-alzheimers-in-people-with-symptoms-using-a-blood-test.html"&gt;simple blood draw, like a routine test&lt;/a&gt;, biochemical signals of the disease can be identified — “will lead to a new diagnostic revolution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;These tools are “crucial” for confirming the diagnosis at all stages of the disease, says Fortea. He explains that when clinical evaluation and neuropsychological testing confirm mild cognitive impairment, in 60% of cases it will be Alzheimer’s, but in the remaining 40% it will not; and depending on the situation, the patient’s progression and prognosis will be very different. “Therefore, I absolutely need a biomarker to identify who has Alzheimer’s. Otherwise, I won’t know what’s happening,” he says. According to Fortea, in asymptomatic contexts, the only way to select individuals who have Alzheimer’s will also be the biomarker. “The day there are preventive treatments, that biomarker will be our only tool to identify these people,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Fortea is very optimistic about the med-term advances: “We can now diagnose the presence of proteins [related to Alzheimer’s] in the brain of cognitively healthy people. We still can’t predict with certainty whether or when all of these people who have these proteins in their brains will develop the disease, and that’s why population screening isn’t recommended, but this isn’t science fiction. These are clinical trials that are underway and will be published in 2027. In two years, we’ll know if removing amyloid in people without symptoms slows the onset of the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;If this is the case, he says, “conducting &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-07-09/can-science-predict-dementia-years-in-advance-the-battle-to-get-ahead-of-neurodegenerative-diseases.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-07-09/can-science-predict-dementia-years-in-advance-the-battle-to-get-ahead-of-neurodegenerative-diseases.html"&gt;population screenings&lt;/a&gt; and trying to prevent it would be justified.” “We’re not there yet, but we have diagnostic tools that work and clinical trials are underway. This doesn’t end with these two approved drugs; there are many more to come, not only in these stages of the disease but in others as well. The disease in five years may be unrecognizable from the perspective of how we treat it, prevent it, and what we do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Experts also predict more advances in the field of prevention. In fact, a scientific review identified 14 risk factors — including smoking, hypertension, sedentary lifestyle, and pollution — to avoid in order to prevent nearly half of all dementia cases. “There is potential in prevention,” argues Eider Arenaza-Urquijo, ISGlobal researcher and author of one of the articles in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet &lt;/i&gt;series: “We have already seen a study that has shown that a lifestyle intervention — physical exercise, nutrition, cognitive and social activity — has an impact on cognitive decline in people at higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sign up for &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"&gt;&lt;i&gt;our weekly newsletter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EL PAÍS English</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 15:18:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_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</guid></item><item><title>您什么时候需要接种流感疫苗？根据美国疾病控制与预防中心（ CDC ）的数据，现在是最佳时机- AL.com</title><link>https://www.al.com/news/2025/09/when-do-you-need-to-get-your-flu-shot-heres-the-best-time-according-to-cdc.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NRXTS2V42VABFIPSREBCFWKHEE"&gt;The best way to prevent the flu and serious complications is by getting a flu vaccination every season.

It is advised to consider September through October as the prime time for flu vaccinations. Receiving the vaccine in July and August is not recommended, except in specific cases where the person will not be able to get the shot in September or October, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2022-2023/flu-vaccination-recommendations-adopted.htm" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who should get the flu vaccine?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PQU3K62W3JFVHNLCJPH5PZRL6A"&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/rr/rr7305a1.htm" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; that everyone 6 months or older receive a flu vaccine. The effectiveness of the vaccine varies depending on how closely the virus strains in the vaccine match those currently circulating. However, the CDC says vaccination is the most important protection from contracting influenza and potential complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What flu vaccine options are available? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="V5W5SCASSRHNRO4FHW5CWWBTDM"&gt;There are a few choices when it comes to available flu vaccines offered at pharmacies, doctor’s offices and health clinics. Trivalent influenza vaccines, which protect against three different strains of the virus, are recommended for all age groups. However, those over 65 are at a higher risk of complications from the flu so the CDC recommends an enhanced vaccine to provide better protection. The Food and Drug Administration approved a nasal spray vaccination option last year called FluMist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CMLHKZ74YJF7NGSFKNGIWPKD54"&gt;For those with egg allergies, the vaccine is available in egg-free formulations.

Well, a recent report from the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention is sounding the alarm about the rising prevalence of the biting insects in the United States and the potentially deadly disease they spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say Chagas disease should be declared endemic in the U.S. because it is now a constant occurrence. The disease is caused by a parasite spread in the droppings of infected triatomine insects, commonly known as kissing bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease is not spread person to person, but it can spread through contaminated blood, organs, food and pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kissing bugs got their name because they usually bite people in the face and around the mouth area at night while they’re asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(MORE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://weather.com/health/allergy/video/why-ragweed-allergy-symptoms-may-be-worse-in-fall" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Why This Allergy Is So Bad Now;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Allergy Is So Bad Now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bugs were once mostly found in the tropics, but with climate change causing warmer temperatures around the globe, the blood-sucking insects are now more prevalent in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC report&lt;/a&gt; says kissing bugs have been found in 32 states, mostly in the South. Chagas disease has been found in pets like cats and dogs, as well zoo and wild animals in 17 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human cases have been confirmed in eight states: Texas, California, Arizona, Tennessee, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, experts point out that because the disease is not well known and doctors aren’t looking for it, cases are likely significantly higher. The nature of the disease also contributes to the unknown number of infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immediate symptoms of Chagas disease can include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the infection can linger for years, and many people will not show any of those symptoms. About 20% to 30% of those who get the disease will develop much more serious problems like an enlarged heart, colon or esophagus, heart failure and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(MORE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://weather.com/news/climate/video/tropical-trees-help-cool-the-planet-climate-change" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:How Planting Trees In The Tropics Could Help Cool The Planet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Planting Trees In The Tropics Could Help Cool The Planet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it’s caught early, Chagas disease can be treated with two types of antiparastic medication.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Korean researchers have uncovered compelling evidence that oral bacteria, once colonized in the gut, can affect neurons in the brain and potentially trigger Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The joint research team, led by Professor Ara Koh and doctoral candidate Hyunji Park of POSTECH's Department of Life Sciences, together with Professor Yunjong Lee and doctoral candidate Jiwon Cheon of Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, collaborated with Professor Han-Joon Kim of Seoul National University College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have identified the mechanism by which metabolites produced by &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/oral+bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;oral bacteria&lt;/a&gt; in the gut may trigger the development of Parkinson's disease. The findings were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63473-4" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; online in &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease is a major neurological disorder characterized by tremors, stiffness, and slowed movement. It affects approximately 1–2% of the global population over the age of 65, making it one of the most common age-related brain diseases. Although previous studies suggested that the gut microbiota of individuals with Parkinson's differs from that of healthy individuals, the specific microbes and metabolites have remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found an increased abundance of Streptococcus mutans—a well-known oral bacterium that causes &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dental+caries/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dental caries&lt;/a&gt;—in the gut microbiome of Parkinson's patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly, S. mutans produces the enzyme urocanate reductase (UrdA) and its metabolite imidazole propionate (ImP), both of which were present at elevated levels in the gut and blood of patients. ImP appeared capable of entering systemic circulation, reaching the brain, and contributing to the loss of dopaminergic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Using mouse models, the researchers introduced S. mutans into the gut or engineered E. coli to express UrdA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, the mice showed elevated ImP levels in blood and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+tissue/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain tissue&lt;/a&gt;, along with the hallmark features of Parkinson's symptoms: loss of dopaminergic neurons, heightened neuroinflammation, impaired &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/motor+function/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;motor function&lt;/a&gt;, and increased aggregation of alpha-synuclein, a protein central to disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further experiments demonstrated that these effects depend on the activation of the signaling protein complex mTORC1. Treating mice with an mTORC1 inhibitor significantly reduced neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and alpha-synuclein aggregation, and motor dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that targeting the oral–gut microbiome and its metabolites may offer new therapeutic strategies for Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of how oral microbes in the gut can influence the brain and contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease," said Professor Ara Koh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It highlights the potential of targeting the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gut+microbiota/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt; as a therapeutic strategy, offering a new direction for Parkinson's treatment."&lt;/p&gt;

Courtesy of Tim and Kelsey Drury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But over time, Jack stopped hitting milestones — and the joy of early triumph gave way to fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then came the devastating news: The Drurys’ only child had a rare, terminal disease so aggressive, most kids don’t live to see their 10th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I was having dreams of planning his funeral,” said Kelsey, 34, recalling the dark days after Jack’s diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, against all odds, there’s a flicker of hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In New Jersey, a grassroots group is racing to launch the first clinical trial for a gene therapy that could give Jack — and others like him — a fighting chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Early signs, growing concerns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Drurys first noticed something was off around 8 months, when Jack still hadn’t rolled over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“He just kind of laid there and played, batting at objects that were above him,” Kelsey said. “Cognitively, he was there, he would laugh and look at you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At first, it was easy to dismiss — Jack was born two months early, and preemies often &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/preemie/Pages/Preemie-Milestones.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:take longer to meet developmental milestones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;take longer to meet developmental milestones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack developed normally until a few months before turning 1. Courtesy of Tim and Kelsey Drury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“He was right on target as far as fine motor skills and babbling,” Kelsey said. “But that was around the same time we started to notice that he was progressively getting more and more delayed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Drurys enrolled Jack in feeding, physical and occupational therapy at 10 months, but no one could explain why he was falling behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We would do hours of PT, then go home and work on exercises. There was no progress at all,” Kelsey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Eventually, he just never crawled,” she added. Instead, he mastered “butt scooting” to get around their South Amboy home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At 18 months, things took a turn. Suddenly, Jack couldn’t put weight on his legs, let alone walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, children with Jack’s disease lose their motor skills. Courtesy of Tim and Kelsey Drury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I used to call him spaghetti man because when we’d try to get him to stand, his legs just collapsed,” Kelsey said. “That’s when we grew concerned.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Hope and despair&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The family was referred to a neurologist for genetic testing — but the lab lost Jack’s samples. For six long months, the Drurys were left in limbo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Some days filled with hope, others with really dark thoughts,” said Tim Drury, Jack’s father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On July 1, a month after Jack turned 2, they got the diagnosis: &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/infantile-neuroaxonal-dystrophy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy&lt;/a&gt; (INAD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;INAD is a rare genetic disorder that causes fat-like substances to accumulate on the nerves, disrupting signals and slowly stripping children of muscle control, vision, speech and cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For a child to have INAD, both parents must pass on a copy of the faulty PLA2G6 gene. Carrier screening is available, but the process can be complex because INAD is so infrequent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is no known cure or treatment to slow the disease. Fewer than 250 kids worldwide have been diagnosed, according to the &lt;a href="https://rarediseases.org/organizations/inadcure-foundation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Organization for Rare Disorders;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Organization for Rare Disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are just a handful of children in the US living with INAD. Courtesy of Tim and Kelsey Drury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The diagnosis was crushing — a disease so rare, even their own doctors were stumped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Not only did we not know about it, but the neurologist who shared the genetic results with us admitted she hadn’t heard of it before,” Tim, 37, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Their pediatrician and therapists were just as clueless. But one doctor had heard about the &lt;a href="https://inadcure.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:INADcure Foundation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;INADcure Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and pointed the Drurys in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It turns out, out of all the places in the world, the only foundation looking toward a potential treatment — and aiming for a cure — is based right here in New Jersey,” Tim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For years, the nonprofit has worked with scientists to develop a gene therapy designed to deliver a healthy copy of the PLA2G6 gene — the one affected by INAD — to the cells that need it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The goal is to address the root cause of INAD, with the hope of slowing or stabilizing disease progression,” &lt;a href="https://inadcure.org/mission/ourteam/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Leena Panwala;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Leena Panwala&lt;/a&gt;, the foundation’s founder and president, told The Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene therapy treatments for INAD are showing promise.

Kelsey expected them to receive a trickle of donations — not a tidal wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It took us six days to close the gap on the $450,000,” Tim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What started as gifts from family and friends quickly snowballed into support from the community and even celebrities like “Real Housewives of New Jersey” star Danielle Cabral and Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi of “Jersey Shore” fame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The INADcure Foundation is waiting on FDA approval to launch the clinical trial, with enrollment set to begin as soon as it gets the green light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They have a goal to start this early next year,” Tim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But with just 10 spots available, his son’s place isn’t guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Jack is one of the younger participants globally that they’re aware of, so I think there’s certainly potential that he’ll be part of this study,” Tim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The treatment will cost about $200,000 per child. Jack’s Miracle Mission is working to raise $2 million to cover the full cost of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack continues to go to physical, occupational and speech therapy weekly.

(KKTV) - A mass die-off of prairie dogs in a Colorado county has health officials concerned that it could be the plague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;La Plata County Public Health Department (LPCPH) announced Monday that it was investigating several once-active prairie dog colonies where there was now little to no activity detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;While for many, the word “plague” conjures up images of plague doctors and the “Bring Out Your Dead” scene from “Monty Python and the Holy Grail,” the scourge of 14th century Europe remains alive and thriving in 21st century America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;But unlike the time of the Black Death, in modern times the plague is highly manageable if caught and treated early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The plague bacterium -- commonly bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic -- can be transmitted by fleas and wild rodents, so animal die-offs like what is suspected in La Plata County with the prairie dogs can be a huge red flag that the plague is present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Plague is frequently detected in rock squirrels, prairie dogs, wood rats, and other species of ground squirrels and chipmunks,” LPCPH said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“It’s often caused due to fleas and so fleas can be carried on animals such as rodents, prairie dogs, our pets like dogs and cats, and then when [animals] come around humans, when we interact with them, [fleas] will jump off and they will bite the individual and then that’s how the individual will get plague,” a health official explained to 11 News last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;LPCPH said it first became aware of the prairie dog die-off in August. To date, no confirmed testing has been done, but the department’s observations at the colonies over the last several weeks led it to release its concerns to the public Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Public health staff conducted an onsite investigation leading to suspicion of plague presence in the area,” it said in a news release. “... There may be additional plague exposures in public areas and on private land that we are not yet aware of.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The health department is advising the public not to take matters into its own hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Residents should not eradicate or kill prairie dogs on their property as this increases the risk of exposure to plague-infested fleas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Instead, it advises people to adhere to the following guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;- Wear repellant and appropriate clothing when outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;- Keep pets away from wildlife and protected from fleas with veterinarian-approved topical medications, flea collars, or other methods of prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;- Avoid sleeping alongside your pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;- Do not feed or handle wild animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;- Do not handle dead animals or animal waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;- Treat known rodent sites around your home with flea powder or a suitable insecticide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Symptoms of plague include sudden fever and chills, severe headaches, muscle aches, nausea, vomiting, and feeling ill. Plague can be treated successfully with antibiotics, but an infected person must be treated quickly to avoid serious complications or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Since pets can contract the plague and pass it on to their humans, the health department says to alert your veterinarian immediately if your pet becomes ill with a high fever and/or an abscess or swollen lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Most human cases of the plague in the United States occur in western states: California, southern Oregon, western Neasa, northern New Mexico, northern Arizona and southern Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | text-start article-text"&gt;No human cases of the plague have been reported in Colorado this year. There was a &lt;a href="https://www.kktv.com/2024/07/11/bubonic-plague-confirmed-pueblo-what-you-need-know/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.kktv.com/2024/07/11/bubonic-plague-confirmed-pueblo-what-you-need-know/"&gt;confirmed case in Pueblo County last year&lt;/a&gt;; before that, a 10-year-old girl in La Plata County sadly became one of the rare modern-day fatalities when she died of the plague in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="copyright |"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Copyright 2025 KKTV.

There are also a probable 10 additional cases and deaths, the WHO says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 4 September, the DRC’s Ministry of Health confirmed that the outbreak was caused by the &lt;i&gt;Zaire ebolavirus&lt;/i&gt;, the most dangerous and common of Ebola virus strains, which was also responsible for the 2014–16 outbreak in West Africa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO has issued a call for US$21 million to support the response of the DRC’s government. The agency says that priorities are sending health workers to affected communities, identifying cases as early as possible, increasing community engagement, providing treatment and reducing transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A viral leap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the precise source of the outbreak is not known, researchers say that it probably arose from a spillover event, in which the virus transfers from an infected animal, such as a bat, to humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not identical to previous strains that have been identified, which strongly suggests that it’s a new spillover event,” says epidemiologist Peter Horby of the Pandemic Sciences Institute at the University of Oxford, UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak is currently confined to four regions of Kasai province: Bulape, Mweka, Mushenge and Kakenge. These areas are remote and isolated, making it challenging for responders to reach them, Horby says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the big problem is that the patients — because it’s an isolated area and it’s very rural — are presenting very late, with quite advanced disease and have very restricted health-care systems, so the mortality rate is very high,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this makes tackling the outbreak difficult, “the remoteness may shield the outbreak [from] other settings”, says Henry Kyobe Bosa, who leads the Ebola and COVID-19 response for Uganda’s Ministry of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new model of vascular dementia reveals hidden disease processes and raises urgent questions about the role of microplastics in brain health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vascular dementia, a form of cognitive decline caused by disease in the brain’s small blood vessels, is common but has been studied less intensively than &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_44d955d660610a76fe199b3479668107" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/span&gt; disease, which is marked by abnormal plaques and protein tangles in neural tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A University of New Mexico researcher aims to change that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent paper highlighted by the editors of the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Pathology&lt;/em&gt;, Elaine Bearer, MD, PhD, the Harvey Family Endowed and Distinguished Professor in the UNM School of Medicine’s Department of Pathology, introduces a framework to define and classify different types of vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She hopes the approach will help researchers better understand the disease’s variants and speed the development of effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Multiple Risk Factors and New Concerns&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conditions like hypertension, atherosclerosis and diabetes have been linked to vascular dementia, but other contributing causes, including &lt;a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/unm-scientist-devises-new-way-to-identify-microplastics-in-brain-tissue-from-dementia-patients" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the recent discovery of significant quantities of nano– and microplastics in human brains&lt;/a&gt;, remain poorly understood, Bearer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have been flying blind,” she said. “The various vascular pathologies have not been comprehensively defined, so we haven’t known what we’re treating. And we didn’t know that nano– and microplastics were in the picture, because we couldn’t see them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bearer identified 10 different disease processes that contribute to vascular-based brain injury, typically by causing oxygen or nutrient deficiency, leakage of blood serum, and inflammation or decreased waste elimination. These cause tiny strokes that harm neurons. She lists new and existing experimental techniques, including special stains and novel microscopy, to detect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the paper, Bearer used a specialized microscope to meticulously study tissue from a repository of brains donated by the families of New Mexicans who had died with dementia, employing stains that highlighted the damaged blood vessels. Surprisingly, many patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease also had disease in the small blood vessels of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We suspect that in New Mexico maybe a half of our Alzheimer’s people also have vascular disease,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Toward Better Diagnosis and Treatment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bearer contends a methodical approach to identifying different forms of vascular dementia will help neurologists and neuropathologists more accurately score the severity of the disease in both living and deceased patients and advance the search for potential treatments — and even cures. To make that happen, the &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_8b74678badcaea2726bdd807c7d5f988" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/span&gt; (NIH) has raised the possibility of forming a consensus group of leading neuropathologists to work out a new classification and scoring system, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a fresh area of concern is the unknown health consequences of nano– and microplastics in the brain, Bearer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nanoplastics in the brain represent a new player on the field of brain pathology,” she said. “All our current thinking about Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias needs to be revised in light of this discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I’m finding is that there’s a lot more plastics in demented people than in normal subjects,” she said. “It seems to correlate with the degree and type of dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quantity of plastics also was associated with higher levels of inflammation, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bearer’s work builds on years of collaboration with Gary Rosenberg, MD, professor of Neurology and director of the UNM Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), which &lt;a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/hsc-newsroom-post-alzheimers-research-grant" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;won a five-year $21.7 million NIH grant&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 that supported Bearer’s research. Rosenberg, a longtime chair of the UNM Department of Neurology and also director of the UNM Center for Memory &amp;amp; Aging, has published extensively on the association of vascular disease with dementia symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we started thinking about putting this ADRC together, I thought one of the things I should look at is the vasculature, because nobody’s done it systematically and comprehensively, and we have a world’s expert here at UNM,” Bearer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Describing the pathological changes in this comprehensive way is really new. What I’m hoping will come out of this paper is working with other neuropathology ADRC cores across the country to develop consensus guidelines for classifying vascular changes and the impact of nano– and microplastics on the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This easy, high-protein snack tastes just like a Reese’s peanut butter cup. You can conveniently make it in the yogurt container for quick cleanup. Alternatively, if you don’t have a single-serve container, scoop 1/2 cup yogurt from a larger container into a small bowl. Any nut or seed butter would work well in this four-ingredient recipe.

                One emerging hypothesis explaining food allergies is that food particles first get into the body through a disrupted skin barrier, and the immune system in turn tags food proteins as an invader—something to be fought.

   &lt;p&gt;Food allergies have risen in the United States over the last few decades. Research suggests that 40 years ago the prevalence of food allergies was &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1323893016301137" target="_blank"&gt;less than 1%&lt;/a&gt;. But today that number is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220126.htm" target="_blank"&gt;closer to 6%&lt;/a&gt;. But this trend is not present in all countries — and what people are allergic to varies globally. Today, we dive into the complex world of food allergies with &lt;a href="https://www.luriechildrens.org/en/doctors/waheeda-samady-3250/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Waheeda Samady&lt;/a&gt;.

Paying attention to subtle changes and acting promptly is the best defence against colon cancer,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Subtle' warning signs of bowel cancer are 'often overlooked', Dr Jack Ogden (pictured), a GP at The Lagom Clinic in Bristol, told the Daily Mail &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dame Deborah James, nicknamed the 'bowel babe' raised more than £11.3mn for Cancer Research and is credited for increasing awareness of the disease, which killed her in 2022 aged 40&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first, commonly overlooked sign is iron deficiency anemia, which can present as 'unexplained fatigue, pale skin or shortness of breath', Dr Ogden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anemia is a condition when the body doesn't have enough red blood cells to pump oxygen around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also cause symptoms like chest pain, heart palpitations, headaches and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because tumours can bleed, causing iron loss and cause inflammation that produces a protein which interferes with iron absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Equally, constipation, diarrhoea, or suddenly noticing narrower stools with no clear cause, is another key easy-to-dismiss subtle bowel cancer sign, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pencil-thin stools can be an indicator that a tumour is obstructing the colon causing it to squeeze stool into a thinner shape, Dr Ogden added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, losing weight without changing diet or exercising more is the third pain free sign, that may indicate the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Worryingly, he said it doesn't have to be sudden—it can also be subtle or gradual.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Often this weight loss can be caused by increased metabolic demand, loss of appetite and tumours preventing the absorption of nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bloating and abdominal discomfort, equally, is the fourth 'subtle' sign of the cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This may present itself as 'persistent cramping' or feel full quickly after eating, Dr Ogden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fifth sign, he warned, was blood in the stool—which isn't always necessarily as obvious as it may seem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The blood can be dark or hidden and only detectable via stool tests, Dr Ogden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If stools are dark red or black it can be a sign bleeding is taking place higher up in the bowel due to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, bright red blood is most commonly caused by haemorrhoids, also known as piles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS, anyone experiencing these symptoms for three weeks or more is advised to speak to their GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;James Van Der Beek, who lives in Texas , revealed in November that he had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer in August 2023, aged just 46&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bowel cancer symptoms can also be caused by other conditions like irritable bowel syndrome, but it's important to get checked so the disease can be spotted as early as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the vast majority of bowel cancer diagnoses affect those aged over 50, rates in older age-groups has either declined or held stable while diagnoses in younger adults have risen by 50 per cent over the last 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cancer Research UK estimates that over half (54 per cent) of bowel cancer cases in the UK are preventable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have suggested obesity, antibiotic over-use, mobile phone radiation and even invisible particles of plastic in drinking water are potential triggers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent global review found rates of colorectal cancer—also known as bowel cancer —in under-50s are climbing in 27 out of 50 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;England has one of the steepest increases, with cases in younger adults rising by an average of 3.6 per cent a year, while in the US, the rate is going up by around two per cent annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When we sleep, the body releases its '&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone"&gt;growth hormone&lt;/a&gt;', building up and repairing muscles and bones – but the details of how and why have been something of a mystery, until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a close analysis of brain circuitry in mice, researchers led by a team from the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) have found special mechanisms and feedback loops that regulate growth hormone release &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-night-of-poor-sleep-can-change-how-your-brain-sees-food"&gt;while we sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could help us better treat conditions that come with sleep problems, including type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="174439" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/delayed-rem-sleep-may-be-an-early-signal-of-alzheimers-study-finds"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;. Understanding sleep is the key to understanding a whole host of aspects of our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/better-sleep-could-help-your-brain-flush-out-dementia-linked-toxins"&gt;Better Sleep Could Help Your Brain Flush Out Dementia-Linked Toxins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People know that growth hormone release is tightly related to sleep, but only through drawing blood and checking growth hormone levels during sleep," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2025/09/08/sleep-strengthens-muscle-and-bone-by-boosting-growth-hormone-levels-uc-berkeley-researchers-discover-how/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Xinlu Ding, from UC Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're actually directly recording neural activity in mice to see what's going on. We are providing a basic circuit to work on in the future to develop different treatments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174442" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174442" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSleep.jpg" alt="Mouse experiments diagram" class="wp-image-174442 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSleep.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSleep-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseSleep-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174442" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers analyzed the release of growth hormone in mice during sleep/wake cycles. (Ding et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That directly recorded neural activity, logged during multiple sleep-wake cycles in mice, revealed that growth hormone was released in different ways during &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep"&gt;REM (rapid eye movement) sleep&lt;/a&gt; and non-REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While growth hormone was increased in both phases, the neurons promoting and inhibiting its production shifted in terms of their influence. There was also a feedback loop involving neurons in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_coeruleus"&gt;locus coeruleus&lt;/a&gt;, a part of the brain linked to wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that sleep and growth hormone form a tightly balanced system," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2025/09/08/sleep-strengthens-muscle-and-bone-by-boosting-growth-hormone-levels-uc-berkeley-researchers-discover-how/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Daniel Silverman. "Too little sleep reduces growth hormone release, and too much growth hormone can in turn push the brain toward wakefulness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sleep drives growth hormone release, and growth hormone feeds back to regulate wakefulness, and this balance is essential for growth, repair, and metabolic health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides its main job – promoting growth – growth hormone manages how glucose and fat are processed in the body. Without the right amount of the hormone, through a lack of sleep, the risk of obesity, diabetes, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-heart-is-vulnerable-these-4-things-will-help-you-protect-it"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; can increase. That adds to the number of ways that the new discoveries could be linked to good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the locus coeruleus also plays a part in managing how alert the brain is while we're awake. It's possible that the mechanisms revealed here are affecting cognition &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/where-does-brain-fog-come-from-new-evidence-could-solve-the-mystery"&gt;during the day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot more research is needed to determine all this for sure, and while there's good reason to believe that human brains and mice brains operate in the same way in these areas, it still needs to be proven. Ultimately though, new treatments for poor sleep could follow, which is something so many of us &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-4-simple-exercises-could-help-break-your-insomnia"&gt;struggle with&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding the neural circuit for growth hormone release could eventually point toward new hormonal therapies to improve sleep quality or restore normal growth hormone balance," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2025/09/08/sleep-strengthens-muscle-and-bone-by-boosting-growth-hormone-levels-uc-berkeley-researchers-discover-how/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Silverman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are some experimental gene therapies where you target a specific cell type.

                    &lt;h1 itemprop="headline"&gt;Bat Found In Local Residence Tests Positive For Rabies&lt;/h1&gt;
                    
                        &lt;h6&gt;By Craig Manning

                                Sept. 23, 2025&lt;/h6&gt;
                    
                    &lt;span itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Grand Traverse County Health Department (GTCHD) announced on Monday that a bat recently found inside a local residence had tested positive for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services had tested the bat for rabies “after possible human exposure.” Per a GTCHD press release, “all individuals identified as exposed” are now receiving “the necessary post-exposure medical care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spread through bites or scratches from infected animals, rabies is a virus that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the CDC describes&lt;/a&gt; as “deadly if people don’t receive medical care before symptoms start.” However, because the rabies virus needs to travel all the way to the brain before symptoms emerge, the virus has a lengthy incubation period during which it can be prevented. The CDC website notes that roughly 100,000 Americans are vaccinated against the virus each year, following potential or confirmed exposures. Comparatively, fewer than 10 deaths from the virus are reported each year in the United States, thanks to vaccination and prompt medical response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid rabies exposure, GTCHD recommends avoiding contact with wild animals, particularly those with higher likelihood of carrying the rabies virus, including bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes. Other recommendations include keeping pets vaccinated against the virus, sealing openings in the home that might allow bats to gain entry, and never handling bats or other wild animals with bare hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In situations where people do find bats in their home, they are urged not to release the animal back into the wild, but to “safely contain the bat without directly handling it in any way and contact GTCHD at 231-995-6051 to discuss testing and possible exposure.” Those who believe they have been bitten or scratched by an animal, or who have had any contact with a bat, should seek medical attention as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the GTCHD press release, this bat is the 33rd in Michigan to have tested positive for rabies this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="88" data-end="216"&gt;I’ve noticed a funny pattern among people (myself included): certain tiny, non-negotiable rituals reveal a lot about who we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="218" data-end="261"&gt;Case in point? The die-hard night showerer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="263" data-end="567"&gt;If you absolutely must rinse off before your head hits the pillow—no matter how busy, tired, or late it is—there’s a good chance the traits below will feel familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="263" data-end="567"&gt;Think of this as a mirror, not a verdict. Use it to understand yourself better, and maybe to smile at how delightfully consistent you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="569" data-end="583"&gt;Let’s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="585" data-end="611"&gt;1. You thrive on ritual&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="613" data-end="745"&gt;Do you get oddly calm the moment steam fills the bathroom and the day starts sliding off your shoulders? That’s the power of ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="747" data-end="1058"&gt;Night showerers often have a built-in “shutdown sequence.” It’s not just about getting clean; it’s the predictable cue that tells your brain, “We’re done here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="747" data-end="1058"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://jamesclear.com/quotes/you-do-not-rise-to-the-level-of-your-goals-you-fall-to-the-level-of-your-systems"&gt;James Clear&lt;/a&gt; puts it, “You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1060" data-end="1235"&gt;Your shower is a system—reliable, repeatable, and stabilizing. Even if your day was chaos, this one habit stays the same, and that steadiness quietly supports everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1237" data-end="1281"&gt;2. You genuinely care about sleep quality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1283" data-end="1716"&gt;If you swear that you sleep better after a warm rinse, you’re not imagining it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1283" data-end="1716"&gt;A warm shower or bath an hour or two before bedtime can &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/3495/"&gt;help your body cool itself afterward&lt;/a&gt;—a signal that it’s time to sleep—leading to faster sleep onset and potentially better sleep efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1718" data-end="1875"&gt;The nightly shower says you don’t treat sleep like an afterthought. You protect it. You set it up. You respect that tomorrow’s focus begins the night before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1877" data-end="1910"&gt;3. You’re highly sensory-aware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1912" data-end="2163"&gt;Clean skin. Fresh pajamas. Cool sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1912" data-end="2163"&gt;For many night showerers, the textures and temperatures matter. You likely notice small bodily cues—residue from sunscreen, sweat from a commute, a hint of smoke from that restaurant—and want a reset before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2165" data-end="2319"&gt;That sensitivity isn’t “picky;” it’s data. You use it to make your environment work for you. And when your senses feel settled, your mind can settle, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2321" data-end="2385"&gt;4. You’re big on boundaries (even if you don’t announce them)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2387" data-end="2706"&gt;I used to work as a financial analyst, and back then I brought the office home in my head—even after I stopped bringing home the laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2387" data-end="2706"&gt;Switching off was hard. When I started writing, I kept the habit of a firm evening shower. It’s my line in the sand: emails go silent, decisions can wait, and my time becomes my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2708" data-end="2889"&gt;If you’re a nightly shower person, you probably do something similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2708" data-end="2889"&gt;The shower is your door-closing moment—no drama, no speeches, just a quiet boundary that says, “Today is over.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2891" data-end="2923"&gt;5. You’re a planner by nature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2925" data-end="3160"&gt;Rituals make planning easier. Maybe you set out tomorrow’s clothes after drying off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2925" data-end="3160"&gt;Maybe you do your skincare, refill the water on your nightstand, and cue up an alarm. There’s a sequencing to your evening, and the shower anchors it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3162" data-end="3325"&gt;This doesn’t mean you’re rigid. It means you’re intentional. You know that small, consistent steps—wash, wind down, lights out—beat last-minute sprints every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3327" data-end="3364"&gt;6. You self-soothe in healthy ways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3366" data-end="3593"&gt;Stress relief doesn’t need to look heroic. It can look like turning the water a degree warmer and letting your shoulders drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3366" data-end="3593"&gt;The shower is a miniature sensory deprivation chamber: white noise, steady warmth, no notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3595" data-end="3817"&gt;I’ve had entire plot knots for articles untangle in those five minutes. The combo of solitude and sensory comfort is restorative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3595" data-end="3817"&gt;You’re not numbing out; you’re resetting your nervous system without burning hours or money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3819" data-end="3903"&gt;7. You hold yourself to personal standards (and they’re yours, not anyone else’s)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3905" data-end="4121"&gt;Some people feel fine climbing into bed with the day’s dust. Others—maybe you—just can’t. It’s not about judgment; it’s about alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3905" data-end="4121"&gt;Your actions match your internal standards, and that builds quiet self-respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4123" data-end="4403"&gt;Author &lt;a href="https://gretchenrubin.com/podcast/podcast-episode-little-happier-outer-order-contributes-to-inner-calm/"&gt;Gretchen Rubin&lt;/a&gt; says, “Outer order contributes to inner calm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4123" data-end="4403"&gt;A nightly shower is “outer order” at its simplest. It’s a tidy, tactile way to say, “I take care of me.” That message compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4405" data-end="4439"&gt;8. You carve out micro-solitude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4441" data-end="4674"&gt;If you’re a parent, caregiver, manager, or the go-to person in your group, uninterrupted minutes are rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4441" data-end="4674"&gt;The shower is often the only guaranteed alone time you get all day. No one is asking for snacks, numbers, or answers in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4676" data-end="4955"&gt;This micro-solitude is more than a break. It’s a brief return to yourself—thinking your own thoughts, processing your own feelings, catching up with your own mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4676" data-end="4955"&gt;People who always shower at night understand the value of those tiny pockets of privacy and guard them accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4957" data-end="5013"&gt;9. You’re consistent because it’s part of who you are&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5015" data-end="5224"&gt;Here’s what I see with clients and readers who are steadfast night showerers: the habit isn’t powered by willpower anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5015" data-end="5224"&gt;It’s identity. You’re “the kind of person who wraps the day with a rinse,” full stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5226" data-end="5494"&gt;Identity-based habits are durable. When life gets messy, you still do the thing—not because someone told you to, not because an app reminded you, but because it’s who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5226" data-end="5494"&gt;That consistency leaks into other areas: you follow through, you keep promises, you show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5501" data-end="5549"&gt;A few everyday payoffs you probably recognize&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="5551" data-end="5973"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5551" data-end="5679"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5553" data-end="5679"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5553" data-end="5573"&gt;Better mornings.&lt;/strong&gt; There’s less rushing because you’ve already handled hygiene and prep. You start cleaner, lighter, calmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5680" data-end="5840"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5682" data-end="5840"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5682" data-end="5708"&gt;Fewer friction points.&lt;/strong&gt; No debating whether to shower before coffee, breakfast, or that early meeting. One less decision means more brain for what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5841" data-end="5973"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5843" data-end="5973"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5843" data-end="5866"&gt;Improved self-talk.&lt;/strong&gt; It sounds small, but doing what you said you’d do—every single night—nudges you toward “I can rely on me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5975" data-end="6000"&gt;Common myths to ignore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="6002" data-end="6493"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6002" data-end="6162"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6004" data-end="6162"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6004" data-end="6035"&gt;“Night showers waste time.”&lt;/strong&gt; Actually, they often save time by bundling wind-down, stress relief, and hygiene into one ritual—freeing up morning bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6163" data-end="6320"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6165" data-end="6320"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6165" data-end="6197"&gt;“It’s just a hygiene thing.”&lt;/strong&gt; Hygiene is part of it, sure, but the deeper value is psychological: boundary-setting, sensory regulation, and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6321" data-end="6493"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6323" data-end="6493"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6323" data-end="6368"&gt;“Real discipline means morning routines.”&lt;/strong&gt; Real discipline means routines that work. For you. If your evening structure is what keeps the wheels on, that’s discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6495" data-end="6544"&gt;How to make your night shower work even harder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6546" data-end="6609"&gt;If you’re already committed, a few tiny tweaks can level it up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="6611" data-end="7212"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6611" data-end="6741"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6613" data-end="6741"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6613" data-end="6647"&gt;Keep it short and intentional.&lt;/strong&gt; Aim for the minimum time that makes you feel reset. You’re after restoration, not rumination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6742" data-end="6942"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6744" data-end="6942"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6744" data-end="6788"&gt;Pair it with a single “tomorrow” action.&lt;/strong&gt; After toweling off, place your running shoes by the door, load the coffee maker, or put your badge in your bag. The habit stacking makes mornings easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6943" data-end="7092"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6945" data-end="7092"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6945" data-end="6981"&gt;Let scent do some heavy lifting.&lt;/strong&gt; A consistent, mild scent (think eucalyptus or unscented if you’re sensitive) can become a sleep cue over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="7093" data-end="7212"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7095" data-end="7212"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="7095" data-end="7131"&gt;Choose a final “lights-out” cue.&lt;/strong&gt; After the shower: dim lamps, one page of a book, then bed. The sequence matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7214" data-end="7238"&gt;A quick personal note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7240" data-end="7592"&gt;Trail running is my happy place. It also means dirt under my fingernails and the occasional splash of creek water on my calves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7240" data-end="7592"&gt;On those evenings, the shower isn’t optional—it’s a reunion with myself. As the mud swirls down the drain, so does the mental clutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7240" data-end="7592"&gt;I step out feeling like I’ve returned to my baseline. If you know that feeling, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7594" data-end="7610"&gt;Final thought&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7612" data-end="7822"&gt;If you always shower before bed, you’re not just “particular.” You’re building a life scaffolded by small, meaningful actions that help you think clearly, sleep deeply, and show up as the person you want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7824" data-end="7906"&gt;And that’s the bigger story: not hygiene, but identity. Not steam, but self-trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7908" data-end="7919"&gt;Sleep well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medications used many years earlier can still influence the human gut microbiome, according to a large-scale study conducted by the University of Tartu Institute of Genomics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined stool samples and prescription records from more than 2,500 participants in the Estonian Biobank’s Microbiome cohort and discovered that most medications tested were associated with shifts in gut microbes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these changes persisted for years after patients had stopped taking the drugs. The influence was not confined to antibiotics; antidepressants, beta-blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and benzodiazepines also left lasting microbial “fingerprints.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Importance of medication history in microbiome research&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most microbiome studies only consider current medications, but our results show that past drug use can be just as important as it is a surprisingly strong factor in explaining individual microbiome differences,” said Dr. Oliver Aasmets, lead author. This highlights that it is critical to account for drug usage history when studying links between the microbiome and disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_494685" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-494685" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Researcher-Handling-Lab-Samples-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-494685" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Researcher-Handling-Lab-Samples-777x518.jpg" alt="Researcher Handling Lab Samples" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Researcher-Handling-Lab-Samples-777x518.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Researcher-Handling-Lab-Samples-400x267.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Researcher-Handling-Lab-Samples-768x512.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Researcher-Handling-Lab-Samples-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Researcher-Handling-Lab-Samples-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Researcher-Handling-Lab-Samples-150x100.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Researcher-Handling-Lab-Samples-450x300.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Researcher-Handling-Lab-Samples-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-494685" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Credit: Karl-Erik Piirimees&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, benzodiazepines, which are commonly prescribed to treat anxiety, were found to influence the gut microbiome to a degree similar to broad-spectrum antibiotics. The study also revealed that medications within the same drug class, such as diazepam and alprazolam, can vary in the extent to which they disturb microbial communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Confirmed long-term microbial shifts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow-up samples from a subset of participants confirmed that starting or stopping certain drugs caused predictable microbial shifts, suggesting causal effects. Despite the small sample size of the second time-point analysis, the authors were able to verify long-term effects of proton pump inhibitors, selective &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_80cb7583dd5c79ce1410aa9892b052bf" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;serotonin&lt;/span&gt; reuptake inhibitors, and antibiotics, such as penicillins in combination and macrolides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a comprehensive systematic evaluation of long-term medication effects on the microbiome using real-world medical health records,” said Professor Elin Org, corresponding author. “We hope this encourages researchers and clinicians to factor in medication history when interpreting microbiome data.”&lt;/p&gt;

For those in the aspirin group, there was a 7.7 percent chance of cancer coming back within the three years covered by the study. For &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo"&gt;the placebo group&lt;/a&gt;, the chances were 14.1 to 16.8 percent, depending on the type of mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aspirin is a drug that is readily available globally and extremely inexpensive compared to many modern cancer drugs, which is very positive," &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/common-inexpensive-drug-halves-recurrence-in-colorectal-cancer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Karolinska Institute surgeon Anna Martling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175096" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175096" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/CancerRisk.jpg" alt="Cancer risk graph" class="wp-image-175096 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/CancerRisk.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/CancerRisk-548x415.jpg 548w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/CancerRisk-600x454.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175096" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Aspirin was linked to a lower risk of recurring cancer.

At the same time, research has also highlighted associations between aspirin and an elevated risk of other health problems, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-shows-the-dangers-outweigh-the-benefits-when-it-comes-to-a-daily-aspirin"&gt;including internal bleeding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that cancers are already screened for critical mutations, which in this study accounted for a little over 1 in 3 &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/what-is-colorectal-cancer.html"&gt;colorectal cancers&lt;/a&gt; – a substantial number of cases that could potentially be targeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aspirin is being tested here in a completely new context as a precision medicine treatment," &lt;a href="https://news.ki.se/common-inexpensive-drug-halves-recurrence-in-colorectal-cancer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Martling. "This is a clear example of how we can use genetic information to personalize treatment and at the same time save both resources and suffering."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2504650"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast, music-driven breathwork was shown to induce psychedelic-like states, shifting brain blood flow and reducing negative emotions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Participants described feelings of unity, bliss, and euphoria, suggesting breathwork may offer a safe, natural alternative to psychedelics in mental health treatment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Breathwork While Listening to Music&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breathing exercises performed to music may bring about feelings of deep bliss, while also altering blood flow in areas of the brain involved in processing emotions. This finding comes from a study published recently in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt; by Amy Amla Kartar of the Colasanti Lab in the Department of Clinical Neuroscience at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, U.K., and her colleagues. The research showed that these changes can take place even when the body shows signs of a stress response, and they are linked with a reduction in reported negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, breathwork has become increasingly popular as a way to ease psychological distress. Certain approaches that involve faster or deeper breathing, often paired with music, can create altered states of consciousness (ASCs) similar to those brought on by psychedelic drugs. One form, known as high ventilation breathwork (HVB), may provide a drug-free option for achieving these effects, with fewer legal and ethical barriers to widespread use in therapy. Despite its growing appeal, the biological processes and personal experiences behind HVB-induced ASCs have not been studied in depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Exploring Altered States of Consciousness&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, Kartar and her team investigated how HVB produces ASCs in people with experience practicing the technique. They collected self-reported data from 15 online participants, 8 in-lab participants, and 19 who underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Each person completed a 20- to 30-minute session of continuous, rhythmic breathing set to music. Within half an hour after the session, participants filled out questionnaires describing their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the intensity of ASCs evoked by HVB was proportional to cardiovascular sympathetic activation, as indicated by a decrease in heart rate variability, indicating a potential stress response. In addition, HVB-evoked ASCs were associated with a profound decrease in blood flow to the left operculum and posterior insula – brain regions implicated in representing the internal state of the body, including breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, despite HVB causing large and global reductions in blood flow to the brain, there was a progressive increase in blood flow during the session to the right amygdala and anterior hippocampus, which are brain regions involved in the processing of emotional memories. These blood flow changes correlated with psychedelic experiences, demonstrating that these alterations may underlie the positive effects of this breathwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Oceanic Boundlessness and Psychedelic Parallels&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During all experimental sessions, participants reported a reduction in fear and negative emotions, with no adverse reactions. Across participants and experimental settings, HVB reliably enhanced ASCs dominated by Oceanic Boundlessness (OBN), which is a term coined by Freud in 1920 that describes a set of related feelings including spiritual experience, insightfulness, blissful state, positively experienced depersonalization, and the experience of unity. OBN is considered as a defining aspect of ASCs evoked by psychedelic substances, such as &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_7a35a078a0055cdc610debfd9ae5eb2e" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;psilocybin&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, their study was novel and exploratory and requires replication by future research including larger sample sizes and a control group to separate the effects of music on the brain. Despite these limitations, the findings provide a better understanding of HVB and direct research to investigate its therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mapping the Brain During Breathwork&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors add: “Our research is the first to use neuroimaging to map the neurophysiological changes that occur during breathwork. Our key findings include that breathwork can reliably evoke profound psychedelic states. We believe that these states are linked to changes in the function of specific brain regions involved in self-awareness, and fear and emotional memory processing. We found that more profound changes in blood flow in specific brain areas were linked to deeper sensations of unity, bliss, and emotional release, collectively known as “oceanic boundlessness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amy Kartar, lead author, adds: “Conducting this research was a fantastic experience. It was thrilling to explore such a novel area – while many people anecdotally recognize the health benefits of breathwork, this style of fast-paced breathing has received very little scientific attention. We are very grateful to our participants for making this work possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A Natural Path to Transformation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Alessandro Colasanti, P.I., adds: “Breathwork is a powerful yet natural tool for neuromodulation, working through the regulation of metabolism across the body and brain. It holds tremendous promise as a transformative therapeutic intervention for conditions that are often both distressing and disabling.”&lt;/p&gt;

But perhaps it doesn't have to be this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Preventing Alzheimer's disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 report from the influential Lancet Commission suggests that up to one-third of AD cases &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13195-020-00646-x"&gt;could be prevented simply by avoiding certain risk factors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-alzheimers-day-heres-how-far-weve-come-in-search-of-a-cure"&gt;World Alzheimer's Day: Here's How Far We've Come in Search of a Cure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01296-0"&gt;14 modifiable risk factors&lt;/a&gt; encompass: traumatic brain injury, hypertension,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="175109" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="175109" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, obesity, high cholesterol levels, low physical activity levels, too much alcohol consumption, too little education, vision loss, hearing loss, social isolation, and air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this comprehensive list is rooted soundly in science, it's not easy for members of the general public to monitor and manage 14 separate health targets – especially when prevention efforts need to start decades before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a problem that needs addressing. Tackling this problem requires a prevention model that is simple and memorable – something the public can easily embrace, understand, and follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are successful examples that can serve as a template. Stroke prevention associations, for instance, have successfully adopted the &lt;a href="https://www.heartandstroke.ca/stroke/signs-of-stroke"&gt;FAST (Face, Arm, Speech, Time) mnemonic&lt;/a&gt; to teach stroke warning signs. AD prevention needs a FAST equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHIELD (Sleep, Head Injury prevention, Exercise, Learning, and Diet) may fill that role. SHIELD brings together the most significant, overlapping dementia risk factors into five core pillars, offering a clear and effective strategy for prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is a foundational element of SHIELD. Maintaining healthy sleep habits is a key protective factor against dementia. &lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/dr-martha-clare-morris/diet-for-the-mind/9780316441155/"&gt;Adequate sleep&lt;/a&gt; supports &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-023-02229-9"&gt;brain function, memory, mood, and learning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insufficient (less than five hours per night) or poor-quality sleep (frequent awakenings), especially in midlife, increases the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Chronic poor sleep leads to a build-up in the brain of amyloid-beta protein, which is implicated in the development of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/IJG.0000000000001169"&gt;Poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; also increases the likelihood of obesity, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.122.20513"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, and depression, all risk factors for AD. If you're currently sleeping four to five hours per night, consider changing this habit to avoid increasing your risk for developing dementia in later life. Sleep is a vital tool for brain protection and AD prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Head injury&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head injury prevention is, rather surprisingly, often overlooked in conversations about dementia. There are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-200662"&gt;strong links between traumatic brain injuries&lt;/a&gt;, including concussions, and higher AD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such head injuries can occur in a wide variety of settings, not just professional sports. Intimate partner violence, for example, is unfortunately common in our society and is a frequent, but neglected, cause of head trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head injury prevention should start early and continue throughout life, as damage can accumulate over time. Broader safety measures (such as improved helmet designs, stronger concussion protocols in youth and adult sports, and efforts to prevent head injuries in all settings) can play a significant role in protecting long-term brain health and avoiding AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A woman with grey hair using exercise equipment." src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=503&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=503&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690644/original/file-20250912-56-23emct.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=503&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Regular movement, even in small amounts, enables better brain aging. (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-person-working-out-in-a-gym-dHHcDjMcN_I"&gt;Unsplash/Centre for Ageing Better&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is perhaps the most powerful lifestyle habit for reducing the risk of AD. Exercise directly addresses multiple major risk factors, including obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and depression. It also supports the growth of brain cells, memory and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, physical inactivity remains common, especially in high-income countries, where it &lt;a href="https://barlowbooks.com/our-books/save-your-mind/"&gt;may contribute to as many as one in five AD cases&lt;/a&gt;. Exercise is not just "heart medicine," but "brain medicine" too. Regular movement, even in small amounts, enables better brain aging and can help avoid AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Learning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning, both in and out of school, remains one of the strongest protective factors against dementia. Lower educational levels, such as not finishing secondary school, are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(11)70072-2"&gt;linked to a significantly increased risk for dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning contributes to the brain's "cognitive reserve," which is the brain's ability to function well despite damage or disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with AD &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/0003-4819-139-5_Part_2-200309021-00014"&gt;maintained better mental function&lt;/a&gt; if they had continued learning throughout life. Public health messaging should promote life-long learning in all forms – from reading and language learning to engaging hobbies that keep the brain active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's never too early (or too late) to learn another language or to challenge your brain. Boosting your cognitive reserve boosts your brain against AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet also plays a major role in brain health and dementia prevention. No single food prevents dementia. Rather, a combination of nutrient-rich foods supports overall brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/dr-martha-clare-morris/diet-for-the-mind/9780316441155/"&gt;A healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; can lower dementia risk by emphasizing whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and fish, while restricting processed foods, red meat, and sweets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adhering to dietary patterns like the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu5114566"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; has shown promising results in protecting against cognitive decline. The Mediterranean diet is a brain/heart-healthy eating style inspired by the traditional diets of people in countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It emphasizes plant-based foods with olive oil as the primary fat source, while limiting red meat, processed foods, and added sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175110" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175110" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/med_diet_shield_642.jpg" alt="foods in the mediterranean diet" class="wp-image-175110 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/med_diet_shield_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/med_diet_shield_642-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175110" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The Mediterranean diet has been linked with a decrease in Alzheimer's disease.

A healthy diet shouldn't feel restrictive or like a punishment for trying to improve brain health. Instead, it can be framed as a positive investment in long-term independence, clarity, and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By simplifying the science, the SHIELD framework offers a realistic and research-backed approach to brain health. Until a cure is discovered, prevention is the strongest tool. Concepts like SHIELD provide a starting point for achievable prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease should not be seen as inevitable. The statistic that there will be more than 130 million people with AD by 2050 must not be accepted as predestined. With the right decisions and actions, we can work towards AD prevention by protecting the minds and memories of millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Twiss, a fourth-year undergraduate student in Life Sciences at Queen's University, co-authored this story.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265053/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, the team is planning to test the vaccine in women with recurrent yeast infections, also known as recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC). It's thought to affect one in 10 women in their lifetime and cause at least three or more yeast infections every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, treatment relies on just one class of drug, which increases the risk that the infection will develop resistance and be harder to treat. These drugs also cannot be used during pregnancy and do not prevent future infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Karen Norris, lead study author and professor of immunology and translational biomedicine in the UGA College of Veterinary Medicine, said: 'RVVC is not life-threatening, but it is miserable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is a huge need.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Norris noted that the findings of these clinical trials could inform future research relating to more vulnerable populations, such as transplant recipients and cancer patients, who are at risk of life-threatening fungi that cause pneumonia, sepsis and infections in the central nervous system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Norris said: 'I’ve had a physician say to me, "I have patients that I get through stem cell transplants for their cancer treatment, and then they get [the fungus] aspergillosis. I often don’t have adequate treatment for that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's where I believe this vaccine will do the most good: in people who are at high risk for highly dangerous, life-threatening infections.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team's research, published in June in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-025-01171-4.epdf?sharing_token=eSFdZiSvMMMpOoBogqwI7NRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PTjK0U_xzcb8G2-906pF8em6Zq3uUl41a9tMp_PWoQEzy4bK30EZIh5Ne-NgXScB49oHaqGwOPHN9yZL4Uva_XvYG_sII9mtaf8eMv0Iv_vJcHiW1e0quRQNONCkKbZBI%3D"&gt;NPJ Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, tested the NXT-2 vaccine on female mice that had been infected with vulvovaginal candidiasis, or a vaginal yeast infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Candida albicans, which causes yeast infections, is pictured above (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vaccine works by triggering the production of antibodies that work against NXT-2, a protein that helps export RNA and proteins. The antibodies bind to the surface of fungal pathogens and destroy fungal cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One group of mice were given the real vaccine while the other group received a placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found 28 days after a single dose of the shot, vaccinated mice had 50 percent less fungi present in their vaginal fluid than mice who had the placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vaccinated mice also had 35 percent less inflammation in their vaginal tissue compared to the unvaccinated group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team's previous research found the vaccine also reduced levels of Pneumocystis and Aspergillus fungi. Pneumocystis leads to Pneumocystis pneumonia, which generally affects those with weakened immune systems and leads to shortness of breath, fever, fatigue, chest pain and dry cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aspergillus causes the infection Aspergillosis, which can invade the lungs and sinuses and cause internal bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'These studies provide supportive evidence of broad efficacy of NXT-2 and support the rationale for its further development as a single, pan-fungal vaccine for local and systemic fungal infections.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I often don’t have adequate treatment for that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's where I believe this vaccine will do the most good: in people who are at high risk for highly dangerous, life-threatening infections.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team's research, published in June in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-025-01171-4.epdf?sharing_token=eSFdZiSvMMMpOoBogqwI7NRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PTjK0U_xzcb8G2-906pF8em6Zq3uUl41a9tMp_PWoQEzy4bK30EZIh5Ne-NgXScB49oHaqGwOPHN9yZL4Uva_XvYG_sII9mtaf8eMv0Iv_vJcHiW1e0quRQNONCkKbZBI%3D"&gt;NPJ Vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, tested the NXT-2 vaccine on female mice that had been infected with vulvovaginal candidiasis, or a vaginal yeast infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Candida albicans, which causes yeast infections, is pictured above (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vaccine works by triggering the production of antibodies that work against NXT-2, a protein that helps export RNA and proteins. The antibodies bind to the surface of fungal pathogens and destroy fungal cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One group of mice were given the real vaccine while the other group received a placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found 28 days after a single dose of the shot, vaccinated mice had 50 percent less fungi present in their vaginal fluid than mice who had the placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vaccinated mice also had 35 percent less inflammation in their vaginal tissue compared to the unvaccinated group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team's previous research found the vaccine also reduced levels of Pneumocystis and Aspergillus fungi. Pneumocystis leads to Pneumocystis pneumonia, which generally affects those with weakened immune systems and leads to shortness of breath, fever, fatigue, chest pain and dry cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aspergillus causes the infection Aspergillosis, which can invade the lungs and sinuses and cause internal bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'These studies provide supportive evidence of broad efficacy of NXT-2 and support the rationale for its further development as a single, pan-fungal vaccine for local and systemic fungal infections.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They found the DNA of the bacteria Viridians streptococcal, which lives in the mouth and digestive tract, in more than 40 percent of plaque samples from both groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15110035/pancreatic-cancer-oral-bacteria-gum-disease.html"&gt;Naturally found in the mouths of most Americans&lt;/a&gt;, Viridians streptococcal bacteria is usually harmless in healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the participants, the bacteria was largely present as a biofilm, or community of organisms, embedded into the arterial walls, where it lays dormant and evades detection from the immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in people who are immunocompromised or have chronic conditions, the organisms may escape the biofilm and lead to conditions like endocarditis, an infection of the inner lining of the heart that causes inflammation, damage to heart tissue and blockages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When infected tissue breaks off from a heart valve, it travels through the bloodstream and can lodge itself into the coronary artery, blocking blood flow and eventually leading to a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the results, experts are urging Americans to maintain proper oral hygiene, including brushing and flossing teeth twice a day and staying current on dental check ups to reduce the amount of Viridians streptococcal in the mouth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers in Finland found a common bacteria found in the mouth could be linked to America's biggest killer, heart disease (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Pekka J Karhunen, study author and professor in the Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology at Tampere University in Finland, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/heart-attacks-may-be-linked-to-bacterial-infections-study-finds#How-would-oral-bacteria-cause-a-heart-attack"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;: 'We aim to show that there is a biofilm consisting of many bacteria in the atherosclerotic plaques and we also study the possibility that calcification of the biofilm — which occurs in the surface of the teeth — might also be involved in the calcification of coronary arteries.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as nearly one in three Americans, 83million, have some form of cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, heart attack and stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health authorities expect by 2050, more than 60 percent of Americans will have some form of heart disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cardiovascular disease accounts for one in three - 1million - deaths in the US, making it the leading cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published last month in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.125.041521#sec-1"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;, looked at coronary plaque samples from 121 people who suffered a sudden cardiac death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average participant age was 63, and nearly three in four were men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in this group also had an average body mass index (BMI) of 30, indicating obesity, one of the leading causes of heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also looked at an additional 96 people who had undergone an endarterectomy, a surgery to remove plaque from the inner lining of an artery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average participant age in this group was 69, and 72 percent were men. Their average BMI was 27, indicating they were overweight but not obese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Southern states are more at risk of high death rates from heart disease, the latest data from the CDC shows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found 66 percent of plaque samples from the deceased group contained bacteria and 58 percent from the surgery group had it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the most common bacteria in both groups was oral viridans group streptococci (Viridians streptococcal). It was found in 42 percent of deceased patients and 43 percent of those who had surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In normal, unclogged arteries, there was less bacteria.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Karhunen said: 'Oral viridans group Streptococci are known to act as early colonizers in the buildup of the dental biofilm known as dental plaque. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This signals that the streptococci may not be there alone - it is possible that there is a biofilm composed of many bacteria.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He noted that while in the biofilm, bacteria 'are safe inside the jelly-like cover and they do not cause any harm to the individual.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he said the 'situation changes dramatically' when the biofilm is activated through an infection or other cause, resulting in the bacteria spreading to the plaque and causing inflammation and blood clots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Chloe Burke went into cardiac arrest at 21 years old while cheering at the University of Houston due to an undiagnosed congenital heart defect&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Matias Escobar, pictured here in the middle, nearly died while competing in the New York City Triathlon in 2023 at age 38&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria may then lead to endocarditis, an infection in the inner lining of the heart and its valves, which strikes between 10,000 and 30,000 Americans every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition causes irregular growths made of germs and cell pieces to form clumps in the heart called vegetations, which can break loose and travel to the brain, lungs, kidneys or arteries, triggering heart failure, stroke, heart attack and blood clots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers cautioned that the findings are not definitive.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they noted they are studying 'the possibility of developing a vaccine against the formation of a biofilm and bacterial-induced thrombosis.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Elizabeth Klodas, chief medical officer and founder  of Step One Foods, &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a67948713/heart-attack-linked-to-bacterial-infection-study/"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;Prevention the study findings are a reminder that 'our various bodily systems are interconnected.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Getting regular dental check-ups and brushing our teeth and flossing is not only good for our mouths, but also for our hearts.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 01:49:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>告诉《华盛顿邮报》：特朗普和小RFK的自闭症计划对您有何影响？ -《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/22/submissions-autism/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SXHQNQPC5ZAWDFJ2HMFS2GU6QI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Trump administration has made finding answers on autism a top priority, with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAMPA, Idaho — &lt;span&gt;Officials have identified an invasive species of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="/article/news/nation-world/west-nile-virus-cases-running-higher-than-normal-health-warnings/507-4a4e49c2-26df-4375-aae6-508e755f266f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;mosquito&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; in Nampa. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A single Aedes aegypti, also known as the yellow fever or Egyptian mosquito, was recovered by the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/2cmad/posts/pfbid02CwbCQrsLr8eugGf5SAgoWZXhy4eu7TYGaaXjHx8rAGJAyDqjrpiqxEga638qE4jdl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Canyon County Mosquito Abatement District&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; on Aug. 11.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district first visually identified the species, then sent it in for DNA testing in order to confirm. A positive result confirmed the sample as Aedes aegypti on Sept. 17, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canyon County Mosquito Abatement District Director Jim Lunders said this was the first known detection of the species in Idaho. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mosquitoes are native to Africa and can transmit over 50 different diseases, including Zika and dengue. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No additional mosquitos of this kind were found in the surrounding areas, according to the Canyon County Mosquito Abatement District, although officials will continue to monitor through 2026. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The possibility of Ae. aegypti establishing reminds us of the importance of the public taking an active role in minimizing potential habitats around their home," Lunders said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These mosquitoes bite at all times of day and breed in standing water. In order to protect against mosquitoes, people should monitor spaces like flower pots, birdbaths, unused pools and hot tubs, clogged gutters and old tires. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canyon County residents who are experiencing mosquito problems can report them &lt;a href="https://www.2cmad.org/request/"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; or by calling 208-461-8633.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p class="caption"&gt;The La Plata County Public Health department is on the hunt for plague after confirmed reports of mass prairie dog deaths were reported in August. (Jerry McBride/Durango Herald file)&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="expand" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#articleImageModalD0A48675-8120-45F3-8C8F-1B0BCEB49361"&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-arrows-alt"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;La Plata County Public Health is investigating a large prairie dog die-off that has raised suspicions of plague in several undisclosed locations across the county.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;After receiving reports of unusual die-offs in prairie dog colonies in August, staff from the department’s communicable disease branch conducted on-site investigations, according to a news release.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;The investigations included interviewing property owners and neighbors about recent changes in rodent activity and conducting field surveys to collect samples – including carcasses or fleas – said Public Health Director Theresa Anselmo.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;While testing has not confirmed plague, reduced or absent activity has been observed in several colonies, Anselmo said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="content-part__text"&gt;            &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Plague is &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17782-plague" id="link-1fa012292092640a5cc29afa4d32f4b1" target="_blank"&gt;a bacterial disease&lt;/a&gt; caused by Yersinia pestis. It is most often spread by the bites of infected fleas or through direct contact with infected animals such as prairie dogs, squirrels or rats.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;There are three main types of plague: bubonic, which causes the swelling of the lymph nodes; septicemic, which occurs when plague bacteria enter the blood stream; and pneumonic, which affects the respiratory system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p class="factbox-dropdown-button-container"&gt;
        &lt;i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-down factbox-dropdown-button"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;            &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;In August, the department issued CodeRED alerts to residents in areas where prairie dog die-offs were reported. Staff also notified local health care providers and veterinarians to watch for plague symptoms in patients and pets.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“It’s not too concerning, but it is endemic in our area,” Anselmo said. “So it’s just something that we have to be concerned of and be aware – that is around all the time – and not something that necessarily people think about.”&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;The most effective tool against plague is public education, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Plague, caused by bacteria transmitted through the bite of infected fleas or contact with infected animals, is known to occur in prairie dogs, rock squirrels, wood rats and other rodents in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Plague can be treated in humans and pets if detected early. Symptoms include sudden onset of high fever and swollen lymph nodes. People who experience those symptoms are advised to seek medical care immediately. Pet owners should consult a veterinarian if their animal develops a high fever, abscess or swollen lymph nodes, as infected pets can transmit plague to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;To reduce risk of exposure, health officials recommend using insect repellent and protective clothing outdoors, keeping pets away from wildlife and on flea prevention, avoiding sleeping with pets, and not handling dead animals or animal waste.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p class="article__body"&gt;They also caution against killing or eradicating prairie dogs, as it can cause fleas carrying plague bacteria to seek new hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li class="font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Researchers unveiled Delphi-2M in Nature, an AI that forecasts risk for 1,000+ diseases up to 20 years out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;The model outperformed single-disease tools, predicting co-morbidities and generating synthetic health trajectories from medical records.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Trained on UK Biobank and validated on 1.9M Danish health records, Delphi-2M shows promise but faces bias, privacy, and deployment hurdles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Researchers have built an AI system that predicts your risk of developing more than 1,000 diseases up to 20 years before symptoms appear, according to a study published in Nature this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;The model, called &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09529-3.pdf" target="_blank" class="sc-adb616fe-0 bJsyml"&gt;Delphi-2M&lt;/a&gt;, achieved 76% accuracy for near-term health predictions and maintained 70% accuracy even when forecasting a decade into the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;It outperformed existing single-disease risk calculators while simultaneously assessing risks across the entire spectrum of human illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;"The progression of human disease across age is characterized by periods of health, episodes of acute illness and also chronic debilitation, often manifesting as clusters of co-morbidity," the researchers wrote. “Few algorithms are capable of predicting the full spectrum of human disease, which recognizes more than 1,000 diagnoses at the top level of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) coding system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;The system learned these patterns from 402,799 UK Biobank participants, then proved its mettle on 1.9 million Danish health records without any additional training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Before you start rubbing your hands with the idea of your own medical predictor, can you try Delphi-2M yourself?

Add a pancreatic cancer diagnosis to that history, and the model calculates mortality risk jumping nearly ten thousandfold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;The transformer architecture behind Delphi-2M represents each person's health journey as a timeline of diagnostic codes, lifestyle factors like smoking and BMI, and demographic data. "No event" padding tokens fill the gaps between medical visits, teaching the model that the simple passage of time changes baseline risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;This is also similar to how normal LLMs can understand text even if they miss some words or even sentences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;When tested against established clinical tools, Delphi-2M matched or exceeded their performance. For cardiovascular disease prediction, it achieved an AUC of 0.70 compared to 0.69 for AutoPrognosis and 0.71 for QRisk3. For dementia, it hit 0.81 versus 0.81 for UKBDRS. The key difference: those tools predict single conditions. Delphi-2M evaluates everything at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Beyond individual predictions, the system generates entire synthetic health trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Starting from age 60 data, it can simulate thousands of possible health futures, producing population-level disease burden estimates accurate to within statistical margins. One synthetic dataset trained a secondary Delphi model that achieved 74% accuracy—just three percentage points below the original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;The model revealed how diseases influence each other over time. Cancers increased mortality risk with a "half-life" of several years, while septicemia's effect dropped sharply, returning to near-baseline within months. Mental health conditions showed persistent clustering effects, with one diagnosis strongly predicting others in that category years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-b2a202e4-2 bmropA gg-dark:text-white scene:font-itc-avant-garde-gothic-pro scene:font-light"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;The system does have boundaries. Its 20-year predictions drop to around 60-70% accuracy in general, but things will depend on which type of disease and conditions it tries to analyze and forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;“For 97% of diagnoses, the AUC was greater than 0.5, indicating that the vast majority followed patterns with at least partial predictability,” the study says, adding later on that “Delphi-2M’s average AUC values decrease from an average of 0.76 to 0.70 after 10 years,” and that “iIn the first year of sampling, there are on average 17% disease tokens that are correctly predicted, and this drops to less than 14% 20 years later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;In other words, this model is quite good at predicting things under relevant scenarios, but a lot can change in 20 years, so it’s not Nostradamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Rare diseases and highly environmental conditions prove harder to forecast. The UK Biobank's demographic skew—mostly white, educated, relatively healthy volunteers—introduces bias that the researchers acknowledge needs addressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Danish validation revealed another limitation: Delphi-2M learned some UK-specific data collection quirks.

Key modifications included continuous age encoding instead of discrete position markers and an exponential waiting time model to predict when events would occur, not just what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Each health trajectory in the training data contained an average of 18 disease tokens spanning birth to age 80. Sex, BMI categories, smoking status, and alcohol consumption added context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;The model learned to weigh these factors automatically, discovering that obesity increased diabetes risk while smoking elevated cancer probabilities—relationships that medicine has long established but that emerged without explicit programming. It’s truly an LLM for health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;For clinical deployment, several hurdles remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;The model needs validation across more diverse populations—for example, the lifestyles and habits of people from Nigeria, China, and America can be very different, making the model less accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Also, privacy concerns around using detailed health histories require careful handling. Integration with existing healthcare systems poses technical and regulatory challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;But the potential applications span from identifying screening candidates who don't meet age-based criteria to modeling population health interventions. Insurance companies, pharmaceutical firms, and public health agencies may have obvious interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Delphi-2M joins a growing family of transformer-based medical models.
