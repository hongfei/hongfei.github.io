              &lt;p&gt;A man who lived with severe, treatment-resistant depression for over 30 years is now in remission, thanks to a new brain stimulation method that targets selective areas of his brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The man reported &lt;a href="https://osf.io/n3u8k/files/osfstorage"&gt;experiencing joy&lt;/a&gt; for the first time in decades after the treatment. “He was crying and saying, ‘I’m not sad, I’m just happy. I don’t know what to do with these emotions’,” the study’s first author, Ziad Nahas, a psychiatrist and professor at the University of Minnesota, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nahas and a team of researchers across several universities developed a personalized method to implant electrodes and precisely send weak electrical signals into brain areas believed to be involved in depression. By fine-tuning this stimulation using the patient’s feedback, the treatment has relieved the participant’s symptoms for up to two years. Their findings are detailed in a new preprint on &lt;a href="https://osf.io/6dpnx"&gt;&lt;i&gt;PsyArXiv&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has not yet been peer-reviewed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;When depression resists treatment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study’s single participant initially contacted the researchers while they were recruiting for a new clinical trial. At the time, he had been living with treatment-resistant depression for three decades, having first been hospitalized at age 13. Since then, he had undergone multiple hospitalizations and tried dozens of treatments alongside intensive psychotherapy. He had also attempted suicide three times.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Treatment-resistant depression is a common form of major depressive disorder that does not improve significantly after at least two standard treatment attempts, such as medications or therapy. In such cases, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)—which stimulates the brain using weak electrical currents—is often considered a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/electroconvulsive-therapy-can-erase-unwanted-memories-1488586221"&gt;next step&lt;/a&gt;. While ECT has been used for decades and can be effective for some patients, it fails for others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this patient’s case, brain stimulation had previously failed to alleviate any symptoms. He had undergone two courses of electroconvulsive stimulation therapy. The first was moderately effective, but the second and third brought no relief.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem is that most ECT studies stimulate specific brain areas based on a standard brain atlas, Damien Fair, a neuroscientist and professor at the University of Minnesota and a study co-author, explained to Gizmodo. That means that researchers don’t often know exactly which area they’re targeting, since everyone’s brain is different. “It’s a one-size-fits-all approach,” said Fair.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A tailored approach&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To address this, the team developed a personalized stimulation method tailored to the participant’s brain. First, they used functional MRI (fMRI) to map the borders of his brain networks previously linked to depression. This revealed that the patient’s salience network, which processes external stimuli, was about four times larger than in people without depression, potentially contributing to his symptoms, Fair said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers surgically implanted four clusters of electrodes into the brain, over the borders of these brain networks. A few days later, they began sending electrical signals into each of the four networks individually.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;When they stimulated the default mode network (DMN), a group of regions linked to internal thought processes, the patient began to experience happiness. Nahas immediately called Fair. “[Nahas] said, ‘You won’t believe it. We stimulated the default network, and [the participant] is breaking down in tears of joy,’” Fair recalled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;“In psychiatry, we don’t have cures, but this is probably the closest we can get.”&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stimulating the action-mode network, which is involved in planning, and the salience network both led the man to report a sense of calm. Targeting the frontoparietal network, which is involved in decision-making, resulted in improved focus.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Over the next six months, the patient received electrical stimulation in the various brain networks each day for 1 minute, every 5 minutes. The researchers continued to adjust the stimulation settings each month using a statistical method that incorporated the patient’s daily feedback.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By seven weeks post-surgery, the participant no longer experienced suicidal thoughts. By six months, his symptoms had significantly improved. By nine months, he had entered full remission. That remission has lasted for two years.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The uniqueness of PACE is combining very precise, individualized targeting of multiple networks and tuning the parameters so the patient can receive the most benefit,” Nahas said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team has since implanted a second participant and plans to implant a third. Ultimately, they aim to conduct a double-blind clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nahas recently received an email from the original participant, who had embarked on a road trip with his family. He was enjoying his trip, he said. “In psychiatry, we don’t have cures,” Nahas said, “but this is probably the closest we can get.”&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="326" data-end="477"&gt;Longevity without vitality isn’t much of a win. Living to 90 only matters if you can still walk, laugh, and create memories with the people you love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="479" data-end="696"&gt;What’s interesting is that many people who thrive into their 90s don’t start off as perfect models of health. Instead, they make key changes later in life—often after 60—that set them up for a vibrant final chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="698" data-end="759"&gt;Here are eight habits that tend to show up again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="766" data-end="807"&gt;1. They keep moving every single day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="809" data-end="982"&gt;We all know exercise matters, but here’s the twist: the 90+ crowd rarely turns into gym rats. Instead, they focus on movement they enjoy—walking, gardening, yoga, tai chi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="984" data-end="1258"&gt;Dan Buettner, who studied the &lt;a href="https://danbuettner.com/evidence-of-longevity/?.com"&gt;world’s Blue Zones&lt;/a&gt;, found that the longest-lived people don’t “work out” in the modern sense. They simply move naturally throughout the day. As he put it, “Longevity happens to people who have the right lifestyle, not the right genetic code.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1260" data-end="1494"&gt;I’ve noticed this on my own travels. In small towns in Italy, I watched men and women in their 70s and 80s walk to the market every day. It wasn’t exercise—it was life. And that consistency, multiplied over decades, builds vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1496" data-end="1671"&gt;The key here is sustainability. It’s not about pushing yourself to the brink in a spin class. It’s about weaving movement into your life so that it never feels like a chore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1678" data-end="1709"&gt;2. They eat with intention&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1711" data-end="1880"&gt;This doesn’t mean they follow the latest fad diet. Instead, they make conscious choices about food. Smaller portions, more plant-based meals, fewer processed products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1882" data-end="2127"&gt;One friend of mine switched to mostly plant-based eating at 65 after his doctor warned him about cholesterol. Now in his 80s, he bikes with his grandkids. He swears it’s not just what he cut out, but what he added in—beans, leafy greens, nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2129" data-end="2454"&gt;Science backs him up. Research shows that people who adopt &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/08/190807092326.htm?.com"&gt;plant-forward diets&lt;/a&gt; later in life still reap the benefits, including better heart health and lower inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2456" data-end="2650"&gt;And let’s be real: at 60, food often becomes less about indulgence and more about function. People who thrive past 90 learn to see food as fuel for tomorrow rather than just comfort for today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2657" data-end="2697"&gt;3. They maintain a learning mindset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2699" data-end="2780"&gt;What keeps you sharp into your 90s isn’t just crossword puzzles—it’s curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2782" data-end="2985"&gt;I’ve mentioned this before, but when I interviewed a retired teacher in her late 80s, she said the secret to her energy was “never stopping school.” She still takes online courses and joins book clubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2987" data-end="3221"&gt;The brain, like a muscle, responds to use. Psychologist Carol Dweck’s research on &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/04/gs-04thinkpositive/?.com"&gt;growth mindset&lt;/a&gt; applies here: people who believe they can keep learning actually do. And that belief translates into vitality well past retirement age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3223" data-end="3530"&gt;I’ve seen this in small but powerful ways. A man I know in his late 80s started learning Spanish at 70 because he wanted to travel. He never became fluent, but the process itself kept his mind sharp. He still jokes, “I know just enough Spanish to order a beer anywhere in Mexico—and that’s enough for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3537" data-end="3581"&gt;4. They build strong social connections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3583" data-end="3777"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/the-power-and-prevalence-of-loneliness-2017011310977?.com"&gt;Loneliness is as damaging to longevity&lt;/a&gt; as smoking a pack a day. That’s not my opinion—that’s data from the Harvard Study of Adult Development, one of the longest-running studies on human life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3779" data-end="3930"&gt;Those who live longest often invest heavily in relationships. They stay connected to old friends, make new ones, and engage with younger generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3932" data-end="4120"&gt;When I visited Okinawa, Japan—a region famous for its elders—I noticed how many people over 80 still meet daily for tea or small community projects. They laugh. They gossip. They belong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4122" data-end="4189"&gt;That sense of belonging, more than any supplement, sustains them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4191" data-end="4418"&gt;And here’s a small but important detail: they don’t just wait for others to reach out. They initiate. They call, they invite, they check in. It’s this proactive approach that turns acquaintances into lifelong support systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4425" data-end="4473"&gt;5. They cultivate flexibility, not rigidity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4475" data-end="4614"&gt;This one surprised me at first. We think of older people as “set in their ways.” But the vibrant 90-somethings I’ve met are the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4616" data-end="4716"&gt;They adapt. They pick up new hobbies, try new foods, and embrace technology instead of fearing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4718" data-end="4902"&gt;A neighbor of mine started photography at 68. Now he’s 92 and still takes better photos than I do. He says, “The moment you stop trying new things is the moment you start shrinking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4904" data-end="5121"&gt;Psychologists would call this &lt;a href="https://ai.hubermanlab.com/s/9oeGu5FI?.com"&gt;cognitive flexibility&lt;/a&gt;—the ability to adapt thinking and behavior to new situations. It’s one of the strongest predictors of both mental sharpness and emotional resilience in later life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5123" data-end="5331"&gt;And it doesn’t always look grand. Sometimes it’s as simple as learning how to FaceTime the grandkids or experimenting with a plant-based recipe. Each small act of openness compounds into long-term vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5338" data-end="5370"&gt;6. They protect their sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5372" data-end="5547"&gt;Sleep often gets ignored in longevity conversations, but it’s a core pillar. Studies link &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/sleep-well-and-reduce-your-risk-of-dementia-and-death-2021050322508?.com"&gt;poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; with higher risk of dementia, cardiovascular problems, and faster aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5549" data-end="5737"&gt;Interestingly, many people I’ve spoken with didn’t get serious about sleep until later in life. After years of late nights and stressful jobs, they finally realized rest wasn’t optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5739" data-end="5927"&gt;One 91-year-old I know swears by her evening ritual: herbal tea, dim lights, no screens after 8. “I wasted decades on too little sleep,” she told me. “Now I treat bedtime like medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5929" data-end="6179"&gt;And she’s not alone. Sleep scientists note that older adults who create &lt;a href="https://internal.mesa-nhlbi.org/participants/discoveries/better-sleep-longer-life-benefits-regular-and-sufficient-sleep-pattern?.com"&gt;consistent bedtime routines&lt;/a&gt; not only live longer but live sharper. Sleep is when the brain clears toxins, when the body repairs itself. Miss it, and vitality slowly slips away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6186" data-end="6229"&gt;7. They find purpose beyond themselves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6231" data-end="6388"&gt;Viktor Frankl wrote, “Those who have a ‘why’ to live, can bear almost any ‘how.’” Purpose is not just a poetic idea—it’s linked to longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6390" data-end="6579"&gt;And here’s the thing: purpose doesn’t have to mean starting a foundation or writing a book. For many, it’s about caring for family, volunteering, mentoring, or even just tending a garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6581" data-end="6765"&gt;After 60, people who thrive into their 90s often reframe their identity. They’re no longer “retired,” they’re contributors in a new way. That sense of purpose anchors their vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6767" data-end="7010"&gt;I once met a man in Greece who was well into his 80s and still ran a small community choir. He said he could have quit years earlier, but “the music keeps me alive.” That struck me. Purpose doesn’t need to be grand—it just needs to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7017" data-end="7057"&gt;8. They manage stress intentionally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7059" data-end="7130"&gt;Nobody escapes stress. But those who stay vibrant learn to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7132" data-end="7326"&gt;Some lean on meditation, others on prayer, others on simply spending more time in nature. I’ve seen people shift from high-stress jobs to slower living and flourish in ways they didn’t expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7328" data-end="7574"&gt;As noted by Dr. Elissa Epel, a stress researcher at UCSF, “How we respond to stress is more important than the stress itself.” People who develop calming practices—even late in life—protect their bodies from the wear and tear of chronic stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7576" data-end="7853"&gt;And crucially, they don’t just &lt;em data-start="7607" data-end="7614"&gt;avoid&lt;/em&gt; stress—they build resilience. I met a woman who started practicing tai chi at 70. She told me, “It’s not about eliminating stress. It’s about giving my body and mind a rhythm to return to.” That rhythm has carried her well into her 90s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7860" data-end="7880"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7882" data-end="8013"&gt;The habits that fuel a long, vibrant life don’t require perfection. They require small, consistent shifts that compound after 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8015" data-end="8102"&gt;Movement. Food. Curiosity. Connection. Flexibility. Rest. Purpose. Stress management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8104" data-end="8150"&gt;Not glamorous, not trendy, but deeply human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8152" data-end="8202"&gt;And the best part? It’s never too late to begin.&lt;/p&gt;

Symptoms typically appear within two weeks of exposure and include fever, nausea, weakness and swollen lymph nodes, the release noted. If detected early, plague can be effectively treated with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;CDPH said that it routinely monitors rodent populations across California for plague activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The department said that surveillance in El Dorado county from 2021 through 2024 identified a total of 41 rodents that showed evidence of exposure to the plague bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;So far in 2025, four rodents have tested positive, county officials said, adding that they were all within the Tahoe Basin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This week’s case is not the region’s first brush with plague. The last confirmed human case in El Dorado county was in 2020, the statement added, and was also believed to be linked to the South Lake Tahoe area. Before that, the release says that two cases were reported in 2015&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/07/california-child-diagnosed-plague-yosemite" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; after exposure in Yosemite national park&lt;/a&gt;.

This year, notorious anti-vaxxer &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/rfk-jr-confirmed-hhs-secretary-what-this-means.html"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; is at the helm of the Health and Human Services Department and is already making changes to public-health guidance that suit his agenda. For example, in May, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped recommending&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/cdc-recommendations-children-2025-covid-vaccine.html"&gt; the COVID-19 vaccine for children&lt;/a&gt; who are 6 months and older. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the country’s leading pediatrician group, opposes the decision, &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/leading-pediatrician-group-recommends-covid-vaccine-infants-toddlers/story?id=124756899"&gt;saying on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that the COVID-19 vaccine &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be part of the annual immunization schedule for children between 6 and 23 months of age. To add to the confusion, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNjP-GiPPkm/"&gt;there are rumors&lt;/a&gt; circulating on social media that, as soon as Friday, the FDA could announce it is restricting access to the COVID vaccine to adults older than 65 and people with high-risk underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmnb13001h3b74cimtn2qh@published" data-word-count="99"&gt;With the COVID-vaccination landscape shaping up to be a hot mess, what does all of this mean for people who want to protect themselves — and their children — against getting infected with the virus in the coming months? Will RFK Jr. also bring his anti-vaccine views to bear on the government’s recommendations for the flu shot and RSV vaccine? And what else can we do to lower the risk of becoming sick in this environment? I called up Dr. Shira Doron, chief infection-control officer at Tufts Medicine, to chat about what to expect this cold and flu season.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmnqvx001q3b74hu99i9g2@published" data-word-count="127"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-modeling-and-forecasting/rt-estimates/index.html"&gt;CDC’s forecasting models&lt;/a&gt; show that COVID-19 infections are currently growing in 34 states. Anecdotally, it sure &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/coronavirus/covid-2025-summer-surge-rcna218754"&gt;feels like we are&lt;/a&gt; in a surge — I got the virus after traveling recently, while several co-workers and friends from across the country also came down with it this month. Doron says that an uptick in cases at this time of year is nothing out of the ordinary, however. While COVID-19 doesn’t exactly follow a seasonal pattern, experts have learned over the past few years to expect a summer wave. “In the fall, it typically goes down, and then it comes back up more in the winter,” Doron says. “The virus usually peaks just around January 1.” In other words: The current summer wave shouldn’t be cause for alarm.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmo39p00203b74r1dnbldd@published" data-word-count="70"&gt;Doron says whether people will have universal access to the COVID-19 vaccine this fall remains to be seen. FDA commissioner Martin Makary &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/20/fda-vaccine-framework-new-covid-shot-recommendations-vinay-prasad-marty-makary/"&gt;said in May&lt;/a&gt; that the agency would propose limiting new vaccines or so-called updated booster shots to people who are 65 and older, or those who are between the ages of 12 and 64 and have at least &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/who-is-eligible-for-a-covid-shot-what-to-know-about-the-fdas-latest-changes"&gt;one underlying health condition&lt;/a&gt; that puts them at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s unclear how exactly that translates into insurance coverage and access.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmolab002j3b74qmdsn6wb@published" data-word-count="50"&gt;In May, &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-rfk-jr-cdc-covid-vaccine-policy-changes-children-pregnancy.html"&gt;the CDC announced&lt;/a&gt; it would no longer recommend the vaccine for healthy children and pregnant women. Still, the agency said kids who between 6 months and 17 years of age “may receive” the shot “informed by the clinical judgment of a health-care provider and personal preference and circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmop90002p3b74orjjjk1h@published" data-word-count="46"&gt;The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other leading health organizations&lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/06/open-letter-urging-covid-19-vaccination-coverage-in-pregnancy"&gt; have also said&lt;/a&gt; pregnant people should continue to get vaccinated, because it’ll protect them and their infants after birth. These groups are urging insurers to continue covering vaccines for patients who are pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmouzu002u3b74h64fuqca@published" data-word-count="102"&gt;While Doron says that you certainly could do that, it may not protect you as effectively in the long run, because the formulation of the upcoming vaccine may be different than the current one to account for the most common COVID-19 strain circulating at the moment. But some protection is still better than none. Doron says that if you haven’t gotten vaccinated against COVID each year, it wouldn’t hurt to change that now. “You stand to gain more from getting it,” she adds. “The more risk factors you have, the more likely you are to be somebody who would experience severe disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmp9ec00393b748kx6dzq0@published" data-word-count="155"&gt;The Trump administration has not updated its CDC recommendations for the flu vaccine so far, Doron says. “Health authorities have been recommending annual influenza vaccination for everyone over the age of 6 months,” she says. “We don’t expect any change in that.” The one thing that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; different this year is that RFK Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/thimerosal-mercury-removed-from-us-flu-vaccines-acip.html"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; that the CDC would stop recommending influenza-vaccine formulations that contain the preservative thimerosal; the HHS secretary has long claimed that thimerosal has been linked to the “epidemic of childhood neurological disorders,” despite there being &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2023/08/scicheck-what-rfk-jr-gets-wrong-about-autism/"&gt;no scientific evidence&lt;/a&gt; to support his position. “That’s probably not a big change for most people,” says Doron, largely because this preservative is rare. Only about 4 percent of all flu vaccines administered last fall and winter in the U.S. contained thimerosal, &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/what-to-know-about-thimerosal-vaccine-preservative-from-bygone-flu-shot-debate"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. So in practice, people should be able to get the flu vaccine easily from their health provider this fall.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmpl7c003f3b74jq488vv9@published" data-word-count="89"&gt;Respiratory syncytial virus, better known as RSV, typically begins spreading in the fall as well. Currently, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/index.html"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; the RSV vaccine for pregnant people, adults over 75, and people over 50 with certain high-risk conditions. (As of now, the vaccine is a onetime dose, not an annual shot.) Infants under 8 months can also receive monoclonal antibody shots to help prevent infection. These guidelines are unlikely to change, according to Doron. “We don’t expect any sort of issues with access, reduced eligibility, or reduced insurance coverage,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmpwe4003p3b74sjn3th0g@published" data-word-count="112"&gt;When it comes to RSV, Doron recommends that those who are eligible get vaccinated in the late summer or early fall. That way, people will be protected by antibodies before cases begin spreading in earnest. For the flu, Doron says the general recommendation is for people to get their annual shot in late October to ensure they are protected through the winter and spring. Alternatively, patients can check out the website for their state’s health department to see how flu cases are trending locally. “You can be watching in September and October,” she suggests. “If you’re starting to see that curve go up, then bump that timeline up and get it sooner.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmqon8003u3b74i6yiqkhi@published" data-word-count="124"&gt;The COVID-19 vaccine can be harder to time because the virus doesn’t follow a very predictable seasonal pattern. “If you get your vaccine in October, it might cover you for that winter wave,” Doron says, “but it’s certainly not going to still be helping you very much by next summer.” She adds that this is due to how short-lived the vaccine’s efficacy is when it comes to preventing infection, even though it’s effective at preventing serious disease for much longer. Doron suggests either getting your COVID and flu vaccines simultaneously in the fall or waiting to get the COVID shot until two to four weeks before a big event you don’t want to miss — whether that’s a vacation, a wedding, or the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmelmqyax00433b74xhwabl89@published" data-word-count="69"&gt;While there’s no silver bullet to prevent infections, Doron says that maintaining healthy habits — a nutritious diet, good sleep, managing stress, working out, and treating underlying medical conditions — are key to strengthening your immune system. She recommends washing your hands frequently and avoiding touching your face. Doron added that wearing a high-quality, well-fitting mask can help decrease the risk of acquiring a respiratory virus in certain settings.&lt;/p&gt;

Lexington Road, Warwick Township, at any time Aug. 8 and 9 may have come into contact with the visitor who has contagious measles, according to the state Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Locations, dates and times of other exposures include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;• Sapp Bros. Travel Center, 15196 Clearfield Shawville Highway, Clearfield, Aug. 5 between 1 and  3 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;• Farmhouse Restaurant at the Barn Resort, 75 Cunningham Road, Gettysburg, Aug. 7 between 5 and 8:30 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span&gt;• Hickory Falls Entertainment Center, 110 Hickory Lane, Hanover, Aug. 7, between 7 and 10 p.m. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;• Garber Mennonite Fellowship, 6082 Old Hanover Road, Spring Grove, Aug. 10, between 8:30 a.m. and two hours after the conclusion of services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Symptoms begin with fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis), followed by a rash that starts on the head and spreads downward, according to the state Department of Health. Without proper protection or supportive care, measles can be deadly. Symptoms can start seven to 21 days after a person was exposed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;People who believe they were exposed to measles and are experiencing symptoms should contact their health care provider or call the state Department of Health toll-free hotline at 877-PA-HEALTH. All residents are encouraged to monitor for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As the nation experiences the highest level of measles cases in decades, Lancaster County had recorded one measles case earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The presence of the virus here is of particular concern as some childhood vaccination rates have decreased below the level at which immunity would keep the spread of the disease under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;div id="tncms-block-1010628" class="tncms-block invert-btn-primary"&gt;&lt;section id="block-1010628" class="block emphasis-h3   "&gt;&lt;div class=" card-bg-color"&gt;&lt;div class="card-panel panel"&gt;

The answer isn't as straightforward or as much of a consensus as it used to be: In an unusual move, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/the-american-academy-of-pediatrics-releases-its-own-evidence-based-immunization-schedule/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommending;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;recommending&lt;/a&gt; a different approach to childhood vaccination than the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both groups agree that families should make individual decisions in consultation with their doctors about whether kids should be vaccinated. But the AAP has a stricter stance for the youngest eligible children in the U.S., recommending that all of them get COVID-19 shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://time.com/7288915/cdc-covid-19-vaccines-pregnant-women-children/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stopped recommending;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stopped recommending&lt;/a&gt; COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children older than six months following &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:guidance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; from the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in May. The CDC does, however, recommend the shot for children who are moderately or severely immunocompromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A day after the AAP released its recommendations, Kennedy fired back at the organization on &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1957914911415153107?s=46&amp;amp;t=9AHxthXdGRIl37bvHR6MCg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:social media;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;, accusing them of allowing pharmaceutical-company donors to guide their recommendations. AAP maintains that its recommendations are based on science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to know about the clashing advice regarding COVID-19 vaccines for kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the AAP recommend in terms of COVID-19 shots for children?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether most children should get a COVID-19 vaccine should be based on their particular risk, the AAP says—taking into account their underlying conditions, such as asthma, obesity, or diabetes, as well as whether they live in a household with people at high risk for developing severe disease. That risk is higher for the youngest eligible age group—ages 6 months to 23 months—which is why the AAP recommends that all kids in this age group get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the youngest kids, the hospitalization rate is similar to that for adults 50 to 64 years old,” says Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases. “It’s not nothing. And that’s for something that can be prevented by a vaccine, which has been better studied than any medical product in our history. We have a very strong level of confidence in the safety of the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HHS did not respond to TIME's request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why are the recommendations different?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, the CDC sets the schedule for which vaccines people should get and at which ages. The CDC makes its decision based on advice from its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is made up of independent experts who volunteer to review data, discuss their findings, and make recommendations to help guide the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kennedy—a longtime vaccine-skeptic who now oversees the CDC as head of HHS—&lt;a href="https://time.com/7292553/rfk-jr-removes-cdc-vaccine-committee-experts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fired;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; all members of ACIP in &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restore-public-trust-vaccines-acip.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:June;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;June&lt;/a&gt;, accusing them of following industry interests. Kennedy replaced them days later with people he had selected, “many of them with strong anti-vaccine views,” says O’Leary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://time.com/7278169/baby-screenings-newborn-changing-trump-administration/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:How Having a Baby Is Changing Under Trump;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Having a Baby Is Changing Under Trump&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After ACIP was replaced, AAP—which typically works closely with the advisory committee and other liaison groups in setting vaccination schedules—decided not to attend ACIP’s first meeting under the new administration in the spring. “We saw from that meeting that ACIP has gone off the rails, essentially, in terms of the way they are operating and the messaging from the new members, which is very much around sowing distrust about vaccines and not making evidence-based vaccine recommendations,” says O’Leary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks later, the AAP and other liaison groups were asked to discontinue their participation in ACIP work groups, O’Leary says. “We received an email un-inviting us,” he says. The reason provided, he says, was that the organizations represented “special interest groups,” which O’Leary says is a “poor interpretation of the rules. All of the organizations at the table have expertise, and there are a lot of reasons to have representation from professional societies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Which advice will doctors and pharmacists follow?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Leary says pediatricians are anticipating having to have more conversations with families about the conflicting vaccine advice, and that the AAP is providing guidance to help inform those discussions on its website and via emails to its members. “Politics has entered the exam room in a way that it never has before,” he says. “These discussions will be contextual, depending on how well the pediatrician knows the family, what relationship they have, and how frank they can be with them in the discussion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, he says, the message from pediatricians should be this: “We are committed to the health of children, and our recommendations are based on the best available science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7287451/fda-new-covid-19-vaccine-guidance/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What the New COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance Means For You;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What the New COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance Means For You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmacists must take a slightly different approach, since they are only allowed to vaccinate according to the CDC’s recommendations, while doctors can vaccinate outside of strictly approved conditions or populations in so-called “off-label” use. Since current CDC recommendations say that families should make their own decisions about whether their children receive the shot, pharmacists will vaccinate kids if parents want them to have the shots, but won’t specifically recommend that people get them. “Our guidance is to always follow what the CDC or HHS recommends,” says Rick Gates, chief pharmacy officer at Walgreens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If families come in with questions about whether their child should get the COVID-19 shot, pharmacists will probably refer them back to their pediatrician or family physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Will insurance cover COVID-19 vaccines for kids if the CDC doesn’t recommend them?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s still not clear how insurers will respond to the differing recommendations. “This is a real concern,” says Dr. David Higgins, an infectious-disease expert at AAP. Traditionally, a recommendation from ACIP means that a shot will be covered, since any vaccines recommended by the committee have to be reimbursed by insurers under the Affordable Care Act. It’s not clear how insurers will interpret the individual choice of families when it comes to vaccinating children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AAP is &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32835?autologincheck=redirected" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:urging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;urging&lt;/a&gt; insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 vaccine for infants six to 23 months, despite the fact that ACIP does not recommend the vaccine for all kids in this age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The AAP is already engaging with private insurers and policymakers to ensure our evidence-based recommendations are covered,” Higgins says, “and we will continue to advocate to make vaccines accessible to every child in every community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact us&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;a href="mailto:letters@time.com?subject=(READER%20FEEDBACK)%20The%20Clashing%20Advice%20Over%20COVID-19%20Shots%20for%20Kids&amp;amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F7311005%2Fcovid-19-vaccine-kids-advice-aap-cdc%2F" data-ylk="slk:letters@time.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;letters@time.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 15:17:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9KRVVtUzljUHFrVzNBVmFWbU1CenEtdkF3MVZVUkIzSUdZbDBKcXoxNzcxQjBOcW92TE5LUE5BU1NYYTBVSnVFbTg3UmpnT1lVUjhzVEtuckprXzZhdC16cUMxMm4ySG9oY1FsOVJrRkx3Zw</guid></item><item><title>令人毛骨悚然的照片显示带有肉泡的“变异”鹿从脸上长出来- PetaPixel</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxPaDJEdU1kc29ZVUFuSFZkWnNRczNpamNRaEhSNkhFOUhxV0N2UTN2dWs1RHpSbVFsQS1CZ3VCOEJZUTFHdzdHOEZOZmU3Q2dGcjJLNlFoTnphY1J2TUViZl9Ob2ZUQ2ZBbTFjckZVNktLemJwYWs3a0FJX1Fzb3kzbExIa1RPdG8wc2Z1NVJYZUFEbkxTVEhreEQwMHljblpTWllHMmlmdm9GblA4RWJn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-full__text default-css"&gt;

Experts have warned that an outbreak is likely this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;These insects multiply in warm weather, which is why more deer are affected during the summer months. Americans should expect to see more cases in areas where deer live.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The condition is caused by a virus that spreads between deer, and experts have warned of a possible outbreak this summer. The insects that carry the disease reproduce in warm weather, which is why more deer develop warts during summer. As a result, Americans can expect to see more cases wherever deer live.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Papillomas are most frequently seen during the late summer and into the fall, probably due to increased biting insect activity during this time of year,” &lt;a href="https://wdfw.wa.gov/species-habitats/diseases/abcesses#:~:text=Papilloma%20viruses%20may%20be%20transferred,during%20this%20time%20of%20year." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener"&gt;the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife says.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fox13seattle.com/news/lumps-growths-washington-deer" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;FOX13&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; while there aren’t any known cases of people contracting plague from deer, there are other situations where a human got it from other animals like prairie dogs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The chances of that happening are pretty rare, but not zero,” Dr. Elis Fisk, Washington State University Anatomic Pathology Resident, tells &lt;em&gt;FOX13&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure id="attachment_809743" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-809743" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2025/08/bunny-eeerie-grotesque-growth-800x420.jpg" alt="Two wild rabbits are shown: the left one in dry grass with a mass of black spiky objects on its face, and the right one in snow with a dark mass hanging from its mouth.

					&lt;p&gt;A person has tested positive for &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/plague" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; after possibly being bitten by an infected flea while camping in South Lake Tahoe, according to public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://d21y75miwcfqoq.cloudfront.net/70c8fc80" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Dorado County’s public health division announced the positive plague case on Tuesday and stated that the individual is currently under the care of a medical professional while recovering at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Plague is naturally present in many parts of &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/california" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, including higher elevation areas of El Dorado County,” Kyle Fliflet, El Dorado County’s acting director of public health, said in &lt;a href="https://www.eldoradocounty.ca.gov/County-Government/Countywide-Press-Releases/Resident-Tests-Positive-for-Plague" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a news release&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s important that individuals take precautions for themselves and their pets when outdoors, especially while walking, hiking and or camping in areas where wild rodents are present.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other information about the person or their condition was released but health officials said they are investigating the situation.&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;div class="c-ad c-ad--bigbox l-article__ad"&gt;							&lt;p class="c-ad__label"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;	&lt;p&gt;Plague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, and plague bacteria are most often transmitted by the bites of fleas that have acquired them from infected squirrels, chipmunks and other wild rodents, according to El Dorado County’s public health division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They say dogs and cats may also bring plague-infected fleas into people’s homes and warn that people can get the disease when they are bitten by infected fleas. Plague can be prevented by avoiding contact with wild rodents and keeping pets away from rodent burrows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="l-article__part" data-shortcode="tp_video"&gt;			    	&lt;div class="c-video c-videoPlay " data-iframe-receiver data-autoplay="" data-displayinline-featured="false" data-displayinline-type="video" data-displayinline-player-id="miniplayer_7184442_68a748c8ccf25" data-displayinline-video-id="7184442" data-displayinline-ratio="16:9" data-displayinline="https://globalnews.ca/video/embed/7184442/#autoplay&amp;amp;stickyiframe=miniplayer_7184442_68a748c8ccf25" data-displayinline-sticky="true"&gt;

				&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say symptoms of plague usually show up within two weeks of exposure to an infected animal or flea and include fever, nausea, weakness and swollen lymph nodes. Plague can be effectively treated with antibiotics if detected early.&lt;/p&gt;					&lt;div class="c-inlineSignup" data-newsletter-inline&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;	&lt;p&gt;There are two other forms: septicemic plague, which spreads through the whole body, and pneumonic plague, which infects the lungs. Pneumonic plague is the most deadly and easiest to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plague is rare in humans, with an average of about seven cases reported annually in the U.S., most of them in the western states, according to federal health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the current case, the most recently reported case of human plague in El Dorado County was in 2020, and the person was likely exposed in the South Lake Tahoe area. Two people were also reported to have plague in 2015 after being exposed to infected rodents or fleas in Yosemite National Park. Both individuals were treated and recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, a resident of northern Arizona died from pneumonic plague. The death in Coconino County was the first recorded death from pneumonic plague since 2007, local officials said. Further details, including the identity of the victim, were not released.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Conducting a clinical trial would be a big next step and could help us understand if omega-3s and omega-6s obtained from diet could help lower risk of EDS.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aged cheeses include &lt;span&gt;cheddar, feta, parmesan and brie.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Salami, sausage, bacon, pepperoni and mortadella, meanwhile, are all classed as cured and processed meat. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yeast-extract spreads include Marmite and Vegemite, while overripe bananas and avocadoes are common examples of d&lt;/span&gt;ried and overripe fruits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14831637/Nap-daytime-sleeping-early-death-dementia.html"&gt;research published in June&lt;/a&gt; found that daytime napping may be linked to an early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;US scientists, who tracked more than 86,000 healthy middle-aged adults, discovered those who regularly napped—particularly in the early afternoon—were more likely to die prematurely than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say daytime sleepiness may be a warning sign of disrupted or poor-quality night-time rest and could point to underlying health problems such as sleep disorders, dementia, or heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They are currently used to treat a number of conditions including heart failure, high blood pressure and sometimes anxiety &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Michelle Halls, senior author of the study and an expert in drug discovery biology at Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, said the findings were exciting as they confirmed the potential link between beta blockers and tumour progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our colleagues previously found that beta blockers are associated with a significant reduction in mortality in people with triple negative breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now we have a much better grasp on why this could be the case,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Terrance Lam, a pharmaceutical PhD candidate at the institute and co-author, added: 'Our collective research strongly suggests that HOXC12 is a potential new indicator for when triple negative breast cancer patients could respond to beta blocker targeted interventions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Triple negative breast cancer is an aggressive cancer which can be especially challenging to treat and identifying new treatment pathways are important.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers are now calling for further studies to 'urgently' determine whether the gene can be used at diagnosis to identify patients who will benefit from beta blocker therapy—and stop their cancer spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beta blockers, commonly prescribed to lower blood pressure, work mainly by slowing the heart and blocking the action of stress hormones such as adrenaline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the study, published in Science Signaling, there is a strong correlation between activation of the beta-2 adrenoceptor and accelerated cancer spread.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found that patients with high levels of HOXC12 expression in women with this form of cancer were associated with poorer overall survival outcomes .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One in seven women in the UK are diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime—around 56,000 a year—making it the most common cancer in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 85 per cent of women diagnosed with breast cancer survive for more than five years following their diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, triple negative breast cancer—which accounts for around 15 per cent of all breast cancers in the UK and US—is far more challenging to treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, it grows and spreads faster than other breast cancer types and has fewer treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One reason for this is because it doesn't interact with hormones such as oestrogen in the same way as other breast cancers—for which there are targeted therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average around 77 per cent of women with triple negative breast cancer will survive their cancer for five years or more after they are diagnosed, but depending on the stage this can fall as low as 12 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is compared to around 90 per cent of women with other forms of breast cancer who will survive for at least five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A low-FODMAP diet involves cutting down on sugars, refined starchy carbohydrates and dairy products which can promote fermentation in the gut and opting for low-FODMAP alternatives &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Removing high FODMAP foods can give your gut lining a chance to repair itself and restore a healthy balance of beneficial bacteria, easing symptoms of IBS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The best low-FODMAP alternatives include non-fermentable vegetables such as aubergines and potatoes, low-fructose fruits like grapes, kiwis and oranges and protein-rich eggs, tofu and seafood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2025.1615671/full"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;researchers at the Haukeland University Hospital, Norway, investigated the impact of a low FODMAP diet on levels of GLP-1—a hormone released in the gut after eating that has been linked with IBS—in patients with the painful condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers studied 30 adult patients with mixed type IBS—when sufferers tend to experience alternating bouts of constipation and diarrhoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health floatRHS" data-version="2" id="mol-97962260-7e8e-11f0-ab9a-e36032aef9e7" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15021193/diet-cure-IBS-indigestion-fodmap-gut-glp.html"&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When done right, snacking can be healthy and help curb your appetite in between meals, but what you snack on matters. Filling up in junk obviously isn’t great for your overall well-being or weight management goals, but even when you think you’re eating healthy snacks, sometimes that isn’t enough to boost your nutrition and energy. &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.faynutrition.com/dietitians/violeta-morris?utm_source=gmb&amp;amp;utm_medium=organic" target="_blank"&gt;Violeta Morris&lt;/a&gt; is an MS, RDN from Columbus, OH, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="http://conciergedietitianvioleta/" target="_blank"&gt;The Concierge Dietitian&lt;/a&gt; and knows a thing or two about proper snacking but realized she wasn’t getting the full health benefits with her daily snack of fruit.

&lt;p&gt;Hunger is not only uncomfortable, but a distraction from daily tasks, which is where snacking comes in. “Snacking is important because it helps maintain steady energy levels throughout the day without relying solely on large meals,” says Morris.  “It can prevent major swings in blood sugar and keep hunger from building too much between meals, which reduces the likelihood of overeating later in the day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snacking is supposed to help eliminate cravings and tide you over until your next meal, but it can often go in the wrong direction. “Snacking often goes wrong when it is unplanned, too frequent, or made up of foods that are high in refined carbohydrates or saturated fats,” says Morris. “These types of snacks can add unnecessary calories and cause blood sugar to spike quickly, leading to a crash that results in increased hunger, cravings, and changes in mood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fruit is touted as a healthy go-to snack, but there are things to be mindful of. “I used to snack too often on fruit alone, such as a banana or a bowl of watermelon,” says Morris. “While fruit is nutrient-rich, I noticed—through wearing a continuous glucose monitor—that my blood sugar would spike soon after eating it by itself.” She explains, “Although I do not have diabetes, I realized that glucose levels affect how everyone feels. As a dietitian, I support eating fruit for its antioxidants and nutrients, but I recommend consuming it after a meal or pairing it with protein or healthy fat to minimize spikes.

&lt;p&gt;Being strategic about how and when she ate fruit gave Morris the upperhand with snacking. “I didn’t eliminate fruit entirely, instead, I paired it with a handful of Brazil nuts or almonds before eating the fruit,” she explains. “This gave me the vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants from the fruit while also adding protein and healthy fats from the nuts.” She adds, “This combination made the snack more balanced and helped prevent blood sugar spikes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By being intentional with snacks—aiming for at least 10 grams of protein along with fiber and healthy fats—I stayed full longer and avoided rapid glucose spikes,”Morris says. “Limiting these spikes reduces the number of times insulin is released throughout the day, which can help the body reduce belly fat and overall weight over time.”&lt;/p&gt;

It is the first West Nile Virus-related death in Kent County in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes carrying West Nile Virus have been captured in mosquito traps across Kent County, including in an area just 3,000 feet from where the person lived. The health department did not disclose where in the county the individual lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our deepest condolences go out to the family and loved ones of this individual," said Brendan Earl, Supervising Sanitarian at the Kent County Health Department. "This tragic outcome is a reminder that mosquitoes in our area are active and capable of spreading serious illness. Prevention remains our best protection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Nile Virus is the top disease carried by mosquitoes, per the health department. Most people develop no symptoms; roughly one out of five people will experience flu-like symptoms; and one out of 150 become severely ill with impacts to the central nervous system, sometimes resulting in death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no vaccine for West Nile Virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend using insect repellent with at least 10 percent DEET, wearing long sleeves and pants, staying indoors at dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active, and draining any bodies of standing water near your home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Follow FOX 17:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.facebook.com/fox17online/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a class="Link" href="https://twitter.com/FOX17"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.instagram.com/fox17online/?hl=en"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/wxmi"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;More Americans are receiving computed tomography (CT) scans than ever before, and while this technology &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/blog/ct-scan-saves-lives"&gt;can save lives&lt;/a&gt;, some scientists are concerned that low doses of ionizing radiation could increase  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="171752" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, at an individual level, the theoretical risk of developing cancer from a CT scan is &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/medical-x-ray-imaging/what-are-radiation-risks-ct"&gt;thought to be very low&lt;/a&gt;, if it exists at all. Patients should not hesitate to undergo these tests if they are considered medically necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the number of CT examinations performed annually in the US has increased by more than 30 percent since 2007, and researchers suggest that unwarranted tests are exposing the population to unnecessary radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-a-viral-cause-of-one-of-the-worlds-most-common-cancers"&gt;Scientists Discover a Viral Cause of One of The World's Most Common Cancers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in April, a team in the US and the UK predicted that low levels of ionizing radiation from CT scans could theoretically account for 5 percent of all new cancer diagnoses in the US. CT scans conducted in 2023 could be responsible for an estimated 103,000 future cases of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's based on some assumptions and historical data from high radiation events, but if right, it would put CT scans on par with other significant &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/radioactive-waste-exposed-children-in-missouri-to-cancer-risks-study-finds"&gt;risk factors for cancer&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heres-why-every-sip-of-alcohol-increases-your-risk-of-cancer"&gt;alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;, at least at a population level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CT is frequently lifesaving, yet its potential harms are often overlooked, and even very small cancer risks will lead to a significant number of future cancers given the tremendous volume of CT use in the United States," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0505"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; the international team of analysts, led by epidemiologist Rebecca Smith-Bindman from the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of now, these are just theoretical risks, but that doesn't mean they aren't worth considering. While scientists know that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2203/dose-response.07-013.Brooks"&gt;high doses of radiation cause cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6447446/"&gt;conclusive evidence&lt;/a&gt; to link low-level radiation to cancer is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential association is &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/prehospital-and-disaster-medicine/article/risk-of-cancer-from-ct-scans-and-other-sources-of-lowdose-radiation-a-critical-appraisal-of-methodologic-quality/23464B0D825CD456741B77476F9997F7"&gt;mostly based&lt;/a&gt; on long-term studies of atomic bomb survivors and those exposed to nuclear power plant meltdowns. For instance, in a group of &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/radiation-risk-from-medical-imaging"&gt;25,000 Hiroshima survivors&lt;/a&gt;, who received a dose of ionizing radiation on par with three or more CT scans, there was a slight but significant increase in cancer risk across a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether those results extend to CT scans remains &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2672242/"&gt;hotly debated&lt;/a&gt;, and the theoretical risks must be weighed against the benefits of this technology, which can now alert patients and doctors to a whole variety of hidden diseases and injuries with very low doses of radiation (about the same amount &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org.au/iheard/can-radiation-from-medical-tests-cause-cancer"&gt;you absorb from your environment&lt;/a&gt; over three years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171762" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171762" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280-642x444.jpg" alt="A patient undergoing a CT scan, with a technician present" class="size-medium wp-image-171762" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280-642x444.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280-600x415.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280-768x532.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/bethesda-naval-medical-center-80380_1280.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171762" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The theoretical risks of CT scans must be weighed against the benefits.

Using statistics from 2016 to 2022, researchers predicted 93 million CT examinations were carried out in 2023, on roughly 62 million patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the associated radiation risks, the team estimates that CT scans in 2023 may be tied to 103,000 future cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To empirically quantify lifetime risk would require decades-long follow-up studies of very large populations," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0505"&gt;acknowledge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, their results suggest that some people may be more susceptible to cancer from low-dose ionizing radiation than others.  Adults receive the vast majority of CT scans, but estimated radiation-induced cancer risks were higher in children and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_158133" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158133" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CancerRiskCT-642x368.png" alt="Cancer Risk CT " class="size-medium wp-image-158133" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CancerRiskCT-642x368.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CancerRiskCT-724x415.png 724w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CancerRiskCT-768x440.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CancerRiskCT-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CancerRiskCT-600x344.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CancerRiskCT.png 1584w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-158133" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The projected number of future cancers (left axis; dark blue and orange circles) against a conservative estimate of cancer incidence (right axis; light blue circles and triangles). &lt;span&gt;(Smith-Bindman et al., &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;JAMA Intern.

She argues it is important to avoid unnecessary CT scans if radiation-free procedures can do the same job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiographer Naomi Gibson, President of the Australian Society of Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy, agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the findings highlight the need for vigilance around long-term radiation exposure, this should not discourage the use of CT imaging when clinically justified," Gibson &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/ct-scans-could-be-responsible-for-5-percent-of-new-cancer-diagnoses-every-year"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In appropriately selected cases, the diagnostic and therapeutic value of CT scans significantly outweighs the potential radiation-associated risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0505"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was first published in April 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Reddit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pictures of the deer with strange clusters of blisters on their flesh have been uploaded to social media from across the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bubbles have been sprouting all over the animals' bodies - pulling them out of shape from their legs to their faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past two months, wildlife watchers have documented unsettling cases in New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials were quick to identify the condition as deer cutaneous fibroma - better known as "deer warts".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition is caused by a virus that spreads between the deer - and experts have warned of an outbreak this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is often spread by disease-carrying insects, like mosquitos and tics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They pass on the virus by transferring the blood of infected animals into healthy ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease-carrying insects breed in warm weather, which is why there are more wart-ridden deer in summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife said: "Papillomas are most frequently seen during the late summer and into the fall, probably due to increased biting insect activity during this time of year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deer are not the only mutated animals that have been startling Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="bc-video-6376889967112" class="brightcove"&gt;&lt;p class="brightcove__holder lazyload"&gt;&lt;video data-account="5067014667001" data-player="JZ81AsHszB"

the lesions or saliva on those that are infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus affecting the deer is from the same broad family as one that can infect humans - known as papillomaviruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can suffer from similar growths on their skin if infected by the human version of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there isn't any danger of a person

from a COVID-19 infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The six-month-long study was conducted by experts across the country, but doctors from National Jewish Health in Colorado led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers collected a total of 10,493 nasal swabs from 1,156 people in the United States, both children and adults. Nasal swabs were collected every two weeks and then tested for 21 respiratory pathogens, including for COVID-19 via a PCR test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that people who had a rhinovirus infection in the past 30 days (rhinovirus is the virus &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rhinoviruses/about/index.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="that most often causes" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a5cc6fe4b0a58e15425ec2" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/rhinoviruses/about/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;that most often causes&lt;/a&gt; the common cold) were 48% less likely to develop a COVID-19 infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children had more frequent rhinovirus infections than adults, and, thus, more genes that protected them against a COVID-19 infection. This may be one reason &lt;a href="https://read.houstonmethodist.org/why-are-children-less-susceptible-to-covid-19" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="children get sick with COVID-19 less often" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a5cc6fe4b0a58e15425ec2" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://read.houstonmethodist.org/why-are-children-less-susceptible-to-covid-19" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;children get sick with COVID-19 less often&lt;/a&gt; than adults and, generally, have more mild illness, researchers wrote in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For adults and children who did get sick with COVID-19 after having a cold, the amount of virus on the nasal swab was less than those who had COVID-19 but didn’t recently have a cold. A smaller viral load often means less severe symptoms, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons a cold may offer some COVID-19 protection, experts told HuffPost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Some common colds are caused by coronavirus — not the novel strain that we’ve all dealt with during the pandemic, but other types of coronaviruses,” said &lt;a href="https://familydoctor.org/media_ambassadors/alexa-mieses-malchuk/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Alexa Mieses Malchuk" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a5cc6fe4b0a58e15425ec2" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://familydoctor.org/media_ambassadors/alexa-mieses-malchuk/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Alexa Mieses Malchuk&lt;/a&gt;, a family physician in Pennsylvania who is not affiliated with the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It certainly stands to reason that the immune system might recognize other coronaviruses as familiar, and therefore make it easier for the immune system to fight them,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the coronaviruses that cause colds are, once again, not the same one that causes COVID-19, it would make sense that coronavirus infection would create some protection against COVID-19, Mieses Malchuk added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s another idea, which is that when you’ve had a lot of inflammation, just immune activity in a given tissue, it actually changes the way that tissue responds to subsequent challenges,” or subsequent infections, in this case, said &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/stuart-campbell-ray/2709653" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Stuart Ray" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a5cc6fe4b0a58e15425ec2" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/stuart-campbell-ray/2709653" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Dr. Stuart Ray&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Maryland who is also not affiliated with the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And so the notion that if you’ve had frequent infections in your respiratory tree, that you might then be more resistant to infections, at least over the short term, like in the study, is plausible,” Ray said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Just like how a sports team performs better when it gets in a lot of practice, “if your immune system just fought something, even if it wasn’t a different type of coronavirus, it might be better positioned to respond to a new infection like COVID-19,” said Mieses Malchuk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, the rhinovirus infections activated antiviral genes in the body that can go on to fight off other infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study does have limitations. First, researchers tested nasal swabs, which can paint a partial picture of infection, but not a full one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We always have to remember when we look at things like the levels of the COVID virus in a nasal swab ... that’s not the level of the virus in the lung or in the person’s body,” said Ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, we’re using the nasal swab as a surrogate, a placeholder, a peek at what might be happening in the body, but it’s not a true picture of that, so we have to be a little cautious about interpreting it,” Ray added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, since nasal swabs were collected every two weeks, participants may have gotten sick and then recovered from viruses like COVID-19 and rhinovirus in that time frame. Meaning, there may have been infections and subsequent virus protections that weren’t accounted for by researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This does not mean that you’re totally protected from COVID-19 if you’ve had a recent cold.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, t&lt;span&gt;his is not reason enough to expose yourself to someone with a cold. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just because you didn’t get SARS-CoV-2 doesn’t mean you’re healthier,” said Ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having repeated infections and becoming more resistant to other viruses isn’t necessarily a good thing, Ray added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could develop asthma as a result of these infections, he noted, along with other complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know in the long term whether this kind of immunity might be a good thing because you’re protected or whether it might have a downside as well,” Ray said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The other thing to note is, while this is exciting and interesting, the immune system and immune function is very complex, so I would hesitate to make any strong generalizations,” added Mieses Malchuk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about your immune system and your virus exposure, you should talk to your doctor, Mieses Malchuk noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, there are things you can do that actually can protect you from getting COVID.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We learned a lot of things during the last few years, and we’re still learning, but there are recommendations for the use of vaccines that we should follow, and vaccines are still a safer way to gain immunity to a virus than infection with that virus,” said Ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Updated COVID shots for 2025-2026 are expected to be available soon.

The study refutes foundational knowledge in the field of neuroscience that losing a limb results in a drastic reorganization of this region, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pretty much every neuroscientist has learnt through their textbook that the brain has the capacity for reorganization, and this is demonstrated through studies on amputees,” says study senior author Tamar Makin, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge, UK. But “textbooks can be wrong”, she adds. “We shouldn’t take anything for granted, especially when it comes to brain research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery could lead to the development of better prosthetic devices, or improved treatments for pain in ‘phantom limbs’ — when people continue to sense the amputated limb. It could also help scientists working to restore sensation in people who have had amputations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mapping cortical plasticity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study first author Hunter Schone, a neuroscientist at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, says that previous reports from some people with amputations had led him and his colleagues to doubt the idea that the brain’s map of the body is reorganized after amputation. These maps are responsible for processing sensory information, such as touch or temperature, at specific body regions. “They would say: ‘I can still feel the limb, I can still move individual fingers of a hand I haven’t had for decades,’” Schone says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this contradiction, the researchers followed three people who were due to undergo amputation of one of their arms. The team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the cortical representations of the body before the surgery, and then after the amputation for up to five years. It is the first study to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before their amputations, participants performed various movements, such as tapping their fingers, pursing their lips and flexing their toes while inside an fMRI scanner that measured the activity in different parts of the brain. This allowed the researchers to create a cortical ‘map’ showing which regions sensed the hand. To test the idea that neighbouring neurons redistribute in the cortex after amputation, they also made maps of the adjacent cortical area — in this case, the part that processes sensations from the lips. The participants repeated this exercise several times after their amputation, tapping “with their phantom fingers”, says Schone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01312-6" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02686-5/d41586-025-02686-5_25418070.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Famous ‘homunculus’ brain map redrawn to include complex movements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed that the brain’s representation of the body was consistent after the arm was amputated. Even five years after surgery, the cortical map of the missing hand was still activated in the same way as before amputation. There was also no evidence that the cortical representation of the lips had shifted into the hand region following amputation — which is what previous studies suggested would happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Makin says their study is “the most decisive direct evidence” that the brain’s in-built body map remains stable after the loss of a limb. “It just goes against the foundational knowledge of the field,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Aging can bring changes to people's bodies, minds and relationships — changes that many are often not prepared for.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Erlene Rosowsky, a clinical psychologist who &lt;a href="https://erlenepsyd.com/" target="_blank"&gt;specializes in aging&lt;/a&gt;, says many people don't see these changes coming because society is obsessed with youth. The emphasis is on all things "anti-aging," she says — not the realities of getting older.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There is a lot of ageism in society, which bolsters the illusion of control and avoiding it," Rosowsky says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But once people begin to experience some of the realities of aging, they may find that younger folks don't really get it.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, my mom, then in her early 80s, was given a slate of knee exercises to do to keep her mobile. "I've realized I'll have to do these exercises for the rest of my life!" she announced. "I didn't know being old would be so much &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Aging was work? I'd never thought about it that way. Then I realized that if, like her, I'd never much enjoyed exercise to begin with, and someone told me I had to start a daily regimen when I was already stiff and in pain, I'd dread it too. But she applied herself and is still doing the exercises today.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rosowsky, who&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;herself is 82, says it's not just that changes to health, cognitive abilities and mobility crop up as people age. One's sense of self often changes as people leave a longtime career and relationships alter as friends move away or die. But, she says, people can adjust. Rosowsky says her body "doesn't look the way I remember it because I'm an older person," but she doesn't get hung up on it. She used to love cross-country skiing but no longer takes to the trails. She retired from teaching at a university but still researches and writes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-83513" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Arielou Marcy is 86 and has weathered some major changes recently. She lives in Lynchburg, Va., and lost her husband of 62 years a couple of years ago. Living without him has been a huge adjustment. However, Marcy lives with one of her daughters, two dogs and four cats, and she says she also has good neighbors and friends. These humans and animals keep her motivated.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The most aggravating change she deals with on a daily basis is &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15837-scoliosis" target="_blank"&gt;scoliosis&lt;/a&gt; — curvature of the spine. Instead of standing upright, "I go east to west," says Marcy. The condition alters her gait, and sometimes it just hurts. "It's driving me nuts," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, she doesn't want scoliosis to define her life. She takes a few over-the-counter painkillers a day, goes to physical therapy twice a week and continues to attend the yoga classes she has been going to for years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She also stays focused on the things she has, not those she lacks. "Be ever grateful for the things you can do," she says. "Don't keep thinking, 'Oh, I used to be able to do that.'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says living with one of her children helps keep her positive. "I have purpose," she says, in being there for her daughter when she gets home from work and helping to keep the house and pets cared for. The two of them are close.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But adult child-older parent relationships can be riddled with exasperation on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It can be hard for adult children to understand what their parents are going through as they age, because they haven't gone through it themselves. Parents may feel that lack of empathy keenly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;How adult children can help parents adjust to change&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rosowsky says there are several ways adult children can help aging parents adjust to life's vicissitudes. This may involve an attitude tweak on the child's part.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;First, slow down and listen, Rosowsky says. Listening is the most important thing an adult child can do for an older parent, but middle-aged offspring are busy and rushed. For anyone on a short visit, she says, why not ask your parent how you can best spend your time with them? And if a parent is struggling with a change to their health, for instance, she suggests saying something like, "I'm seeing this might be hard for you. Is that what you're feeling?" She says there is often a gap between what the adult child thinks a parent needs and what that parent feels they need.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Another thing children may try to oversee is a parent's diet. Many people end up having to alter their diets as they get older. But there's a difference between helping a parent stay on track with a new regime and bludgeoning them with reminders. Rosowsky says by all means make sure Mom or Dad has the information they need about whatever they're supposed to consume and avoid. But if they keep returning to a bag of Cheetos, curb your exasperation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As long as a parent is competent to make decisions, they're competent to make lousy decisions or decisions you wouldn't make," she says. She adds that the mission of the child is to keep their parent safe and healthy. The older adult, though, "doesn't want to be wrapped up." Rather, they want to maintain their sense of autonomy and advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Finally, Rosowsky says, ask your parent to tell stories. In some of her past work in nursing homes, she saw a lot of physically frail people receiving intimate care from staff — the kind of care that felt humiliating to the recipient. It was a big, unwelcome change to their daily existence.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But when the staff member asked the older adult to tell them a story about their life, it altered the dynamic. "The communication went much better," she says, as the older person wasn't a helpless resident being tended to. By telling a story, she says — by giving something — the older adult became an equal part of the exchange.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But sometimes knowing what "should" be done collides with the reality of what one actually gets around to doing. Arielou Marcy is resisting the pressure she feels to make changes to her longtime home — to purge the house of clutter because doing so will, she's told, make things easier for her children after she's gone.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Why should I get rid of all the things I love that I've had throughout my life?" she asks, pointing out an old rocking horse that used to belong to her husband as a child, a teacup from her grandmother and artwork made by her daughters, who are now in their 50s.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Much of the time she's happy to adjust, she says. But sometimes, she's not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;A recent study led by Dr. Tim Cannon, an oncologist at Inova Schar Cancer in Fairfax, revealed a potential link between extreme endurance exercise and increased risk of advanced colon cancer in younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was presented at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting in Chicago, Inova said in a news release this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Several years ago, Dr. Cannon noticed a disturbing trend: multiple ultramarathoners under age 40 were presenting at Inova with advanced-stage colorectal cancer," the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He launched a prospective clinical study to investigate whether long-distance running could be associated with an elevated risk of developing colon cancer. Recruitment material was made with the assistance of the wives of two of the runners who died from colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The participant athletes were otherwise healthy and had no known genetic predisposition or inflammatory conditions,” Cannon said in the release. “Given that many runners describe bleeding after running, and runner’s colitis is understood to be related to colonic ischemia and recurrent inflammation, it made us wonder whether the intense physical stress of endurance training could be contributing to a higher likelihood of mutagenesis causing precancerous polyps.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="opscoad-nvm_instory_ad" data-unit="/22545743209/insidenova/headlines/instory" data-targeting='{"pos":"nvm_instory"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study enrolled 100 participants between the ages of 35 and 50 who had completed at least five marathons or two ultramarathons and had never undergone a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with hereditary cancer syndromes or inflammatory bowel disease were excluded to isolate the potential impact of endurance exercise alone, Inova said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant underwent a screening colonoscopy as part of the study. Prior to the procedure, each also completed a questionnaire covering dietary habits, bowel history, and long-distance running patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All polyps discovered during colonoscopy were reviewed by a panel of gastroenterologists, pathologists and oncologists to determine if they met the criteria for advanced adenomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="opscoad-nvm_instory_ad" data-unit="/22545743209/insidenova/headlines/instory" data-targeting='{"pos":"nvm_instory"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were striking, the release said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;15% of participants had advanced adenomas (pre-cancerous lesions), compared to the expected 1–2% in average-risk individuals in this age range.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;41% of participants had at least one adenoma.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average age of participants was 42.5 years old – two and a half years below the recommended age for a first screening colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first prospective study we know of to explore whether exercise-induced intestinal stress, specifically bowel ischemia from long-distance running, might increase cancer risk,” Cannon said. “While the results don’t prove causation, they strongly suggest that intense endurance exercise could be a meaningful risk factor for colorectal cancer and warrants further study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="opscoad-nvm_instory_ad" data-unit="/22545743209/insidenova/headlines/instory" data-targeting='{"pos":"nvm_instory"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted from October 2022 through December 2024 and received Institutional Review Board approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The team now hopes these findings will spark discussion about earlier screening for high-risk athletes and lead to life-saving detection strategies," Inova said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Beyond these advantages, regular running plays a vital role in lowering the risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and notably, colon cancer. By promoting healthy digestion, reducing inflammation, improving gut motility, supporting immune function, and aiding in weight control, running helps protect the colon from harmful changes that can lead to cancer. Incorporating consistent running or jogging into your lifestyle is a powerful, natural way to improve overall health and significantly reduce the risk of developing colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Marathon running may influence colon cancer development&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.inovanewsroom.org/press-release/2025/08/groundbreaking-inova-study-finds-potential-link-between-long-distance-running-and-colon-cancer/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Inova Schar Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found a possible link between long-distance running and a higher risk of advanced colon cancer in younger adults. The study looked at 100 runners aged 35 to 50 who had completed multiple marathons or ultramarathons. Results showed that 15% had advanced adenomas ( a type of colon polyp that has a higher risk of turning into colon cancer if left untreated), which is much higher than the usual 1-2% seen in the general population. This suggests that intense long-distance running might increase the risk of colorectal cancer, emphasising the need for more research and earlier cancer screening for endurance athletes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Running as a protective factor against colon cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous large-scale studies have confirmed that regular physical activity, including running, significantly reduces the risk of colon cancer. Exercise improves digestive health by enhancing gut motility, which helps prevent the buildup of carcinogens in the colon. Furthermore, running boosts the immune system and reduces chronic inflammation, both important factors in cancer prevention. Marathon training may also regulate hormone levels, reduce insulin resistance, and promote beneficial gut bacteria, contributing further to long-term colon health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;How marathon running lowers colon cancer risk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved digestion: Running stimulates bowel movements, reducing the time harmful substances stay in contact with the colon lining.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced inflammation: Chronic inflammation is a key driver of cancer development. Running lowers inflammatory markers in the body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weight management: Maintaining a healthy weight through regular running decreases obesity-related cancer risks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hormonal balance: Physical activity helps regulate hormones such as insulin and insulin-like growth factors, which, when imbalanced, can promote tumour growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;keyword id="25627620" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="exercise-and-colon-cancer" source="keywords"&gt;Exercise and colon cancer&lt;/keyword&gt; survivors: Enhancing recovery and longevity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is equally beneficial for those who have been diagnosed with colon cancer.

A recent small study suggested an increased risk in extreme endurance runners, but broader research strongly supports exercise as protective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q2: Should I stop running if I’m worried about colon cancer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. Exercise remains vital for overall health. Discuss your concerns and screening options with a healthcare professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q3: What are colon polyps?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon polyps are growths on the lining of the colon that can sometimes develop into cancer if left untreated. Regular screening can detect and remove them early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q4: How often should I get screened for colon cancer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screening recommendations vary by age, family history, and risk factors. Generally, adults over 50 should begin regular screening, but earlier testing may be advised for high-risk groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BOISE, Idaho — Idaho Health officials confirmed a third case of measles in an Idaho resident Wednesday, raising concerns about community transmission of the highly contagious virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest case of confirmed infection was in an unvaccinated child in Bonner County, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and Panhandle Health District. Officials said there is no known connection between this case and the &lt;a href="/article/news/health/idaho-panhandle-health-district-first-measles-1991/293-6ad73a7a-88bf-4c30-8f4e-4bf16494cf63" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;first reported case in Kootenai County&lt;/a&gt;.  Also, the second case was reported in &lt;a href="/article/news/local/bonneville-county-first-measles-case-since-1991/277-caf92ef1-eb2f-429c-8922-297193e0d0cf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Bonneville County last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Without any link between these two confirmed cases in north Idaho or travel outside of their communities, it's reasonable to suspect that there is more measles circulating," said Dr. Christine Hahn, state epidemiologist and Division of Public Health medical director, in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three confirmed cases involve an unvaccinated child.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hahn warned that cases could multiply quickly, as seen in other states nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles spreads through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing. The virus can survive in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area. Patients remain contagious from four days before until four days after the characteristic rash appears.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/article/news/local/an-international-traveler-with-measles-visited-multiple-idaho-locations-during-infectious-period-outbreak/277-78f9f25d-bece-4303-9218-0ddc22204e8e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Symptoms include &lt;/a&gt;fever, runny nose, cough and rash. The disease is highly contagious and can spread rapidly in communities with low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Panhandle Health District states that while many recover without complications, "measles can lead to serious complications, especially in very young children and people with weakened immune systems."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Among measles cases, typically 13% will need hospitalization, and among young children that percent jumps to 21%," Dr. Hahn said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are urging the public to check their vaccination records through their primary health provider.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals who have received the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, have had a confirmed case of measles or were born before 1957 are considered immune to the measles virus. Idaho health officials said the MMR vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles after two doses.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If symptoms develop, people who may have been exposed should monitor for symptoms for 21 days and contact their healthcare provider. Those experiencing measles symptoms should call ahead before visiting medical facilities to allow staff to prepare isolation procedures.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

And yet, deficiencies are not uncommon: 35% of adults in the United States are deficient in vitamin D, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15050-vitamin-d-vitamin-d-deficiency" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, while even more are likely getting some but still less than they should. Despite everything that vitamin D does and the benefits it provides, it can be hard to tell if you're actually deficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most symptoms are vague and can be easily overlooked,” said &lt;a href="https://heathermangieri.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Heather Mangieri, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Heather Mangieri, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a sports and wellness dietitian in Pittsburgh. “As a sports dietitian, I get concerned about a vitamin D deficiency when I see an athlete complaining of fatigue, bone pain, muscle aches, or presenting with multiple bone fractures or injuries.” Other common symptoms of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15050-vitamin-d-vitamin-d-deficiency" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D deficiency;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D deficiency&lt;/a&gt; including muscle weakness and mood changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://heathermangieri.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Heather Mangieri, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Heather Mangieri, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a sports and wellness dietitian in Pittsburgh; &lt;a href="https://www.knsdietitians.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Melissa Prest, D.C.N., R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Melissa Prest, D.C.N., R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist with Kidney Nutrition Specialists in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only do you need adequate amounts of vitamin D to avoid these symptoms, but getting enough can also help you reap all the health benefits this powerful vitamin has to offer. Here, dietitians shared how vitamin D works in the body, plus the benefits it delivers and how to make sure you're getting enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does vitamin D work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is both a nutrient and acts as a hormone,” explained &lt;a href="https://www.knsdietitians.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Melissa Prest, D.C.N., R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Melissa Prest, D.C.N., R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist with Kidney Nutrition Specialists in Seattle. Its main function is to help the body absorb and regulate calcium and &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002424.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:phosphorous;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;phosphorous&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring they’re available to strengthen bones and teeth, she added. It also aids in the absorption of magnesium, which supports muscle and nerve function as well as energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D boosts the immune system, too, by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines, a molecule that signals inflammation, explained Mangieri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of vitamin D—vitamin D2 and vitamin D3. Vitamin D2 naturally occurs in some plants, whereas vitamin D3 is found in some animals and produced by human skin via sunlight exposure, per the &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/vitamin-d/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. Mangieri explained that D3 is considered the more potent form of the vitamin because it “has been shown to raise levels higher and for a longer period of time than D2.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health benefits of vitamin D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ongoing research continues to uncover how crucial vitamin D is to overall health. “It’s involved in many metabolic pathways and scientists continue to investigate its role in heart disease, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a21764231/type-2-diabetes-definition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/mental-health/a37271432/depression-myths/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:depression;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, and multiple sclerosis, among others,” added Mangieri. With that being said, here are some of the ways proper vitamin D levels can improve your overall well-being:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong bones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vitamin D deficiency, especially in older people, increases the risk of fractures and fosters overall weak and soft bones, Prest explained. “This condition is called osteomalacia and can cause bone deformities, pain, seizures from low blood calcium levels, muscle spasms, and dental abnormalities,” she added. A review published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8396272/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:International Journal of Molecular Sciences;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;International Journal of Molecular Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; found that vitamin D deficiency can induce osteomalacia plus increase your risk of developing osteoporosis, or brittle bone disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved immunity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to its ability to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6164284/#:~:text=It%20is%20widely%20thought%20that,of%20many%20immune%2Drelated%20diseases." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:regulate the production of inflammatory cytokines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;regulate the production of inflammatory cytokines&lt;/a&gt;, vitamin D has been found to help the immune system overcome bacterial and viral infections like pneumonia and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034120305311" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:even COVID-19;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;even COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, according to research in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7281985/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, data has linked vitamin D deficiency to defective functioning of the immune system, an increased risk of infections, and a predisposition to developing autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better heart health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with heart disease and cardiovascular disease-related mortality. Researchers writing in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.clinicalnutritionjournal.com/article/S0261-5614(20)30700-7/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clinical Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;explain that vitamin D helps to regulate blood pressure, plus acts on several mechanisms that keep heart disease risk low. So far, studies have not found an explicit benefit of taking high doses of vitamin D to prevent cardiovascular events like heart attacks, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2022/vitamin-d-heart-health-where-benefits-begin-and-end" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&lt;/a&gt;, but experts say it's still important to make sure you're getting the recommended daily dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boosted mood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low vitamin D has been &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6970300/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:scientifically linked to depression;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;scientifically linked to depression&lt;/a&gt;, and vitamin D supplements are sometimes used to treat it. A 2022 review published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9376678/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Frontiers in Public Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Frontiers in Public Health&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that use of vitamin D reduced the incidence of depression and improved the results of depression treatment, especially for women and people who were previously deficient in the vitamin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong muscles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research is ongoing, but one recent study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002604952500109X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Metabolism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Metabolism&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that people who took vitamin D had increased muscle mass and muscle strength compared to a control group. The researchers suspect that vitamin D helps regulate protein synthesis and block the pathways that prompt sarcopenia, or age-related muscle loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get enough vitamin D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three ways to get vitamin D: From food, from the sun, and from supplements. “Fatty fish like salmon, tuna, mackerel, and trout, as well as fish liver oils, are among the best natural sources of vitamin D,” said Mangieri. “Cheese, egg yolks, beef liver, and mushrooms also have small amounts.” Other foods like milk, yogurt, cereal, and orange juice are often fortified with vitamin D, meaning the nutrient is added in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is difficult to get enough vitamin D from foods alone,” Prest admitted. “We need to consume vitamin D and get some exposure to the sun to make sure we have an adequate supply available for our body to use.” With that being said, soaking up the sun isn’t always easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cloud coverage, season, distance from the equator, pollution, skin pigmentation, age, and wearing sunblock can all impact how much vitamin D your body is able to produce,” explained Mangieri. Plus, there’s the danger of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/g20688920/types-of-skin-cancer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:skin cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;skin cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mangieri added that the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health (NIH);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health (NIH)&lt;/a&gt; recommends a daily vitamin D intake for children and adults of 600 to 800 international units (IU). “While I fully encourage a food-first approach,” she said, “when it comes to Vitamin D, a dietary supplement is often needed.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can get both vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 in supplement form. Vitamin D2 supplements are made by exposing the ergosterol in yeast to UV radiation, explained Prest, and vitamin D3 supplements come from the exposure of 7-dehydrocholesterol—obtained from lanolin in the wool of sheep—to UV radiation. “There is also an animal-free version of vitamin D3 made from lichen,” she added, which comes from algae.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For people following a vegan diet or avoiding certain animal products, they can contact the dietary supplement manufacturer to ask about the product’s ingredients, and how it was sourced and processed,” said Prest. It’s also important to note that vitamins and supplements aren’t FDA-regulated. If you need one, Prest recommended looking for a standalone vitamin D supplement versus a multi-vitamin to ensure you get enough of the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Look for brands with the USP verification mark on the label or that have been third-party tested through programs like &lt;a href="https://eatreallivewell.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=861943c2f1d2a67ad6ecc4583&amp;amp;id=0c85598e47&amp;amp;e=53e1cbc321" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:N;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://eatreallivewell.us12.list-manage.com/track/click" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SF Certified for Sport;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;SF Certified for Sport&lt;/a&gt; or Informed Choice,” Mangieri added. “By choosing supplements with these labels, you know that what is on the label is actually present in the product in the amounts stated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, Mangieri suggested having a conversation with your doctor or a registered dietitian before starting the supplement. A professional, she said, can help determine how much you should take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet. They are not medicines and are not intended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or cure diseases. Be cautious about taking dietary supplements if you are pregnant or nursing. Also, be careful about giving supplements to a child, unless recommended by their healthcare provider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 02:47:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE9QY0xQc3l6cU9XTzNfNGZ6S3NRSy1PdE1NUDItR3pDdEc0MkE0TDN5YlVLN25zZEx2cDdmY0FZdDJIbkVlYzJKc2FveVZzb216ZXBZSGxqSWtoWU91bkQ0Y00wU19lTXg5VjRBSnJ3</guid></item><item><title>南太浩湖居民鼠疫检测呈阳性，可能来自跳蚤叮咬：卫生官员- ABC7洛杉矶</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPd01KSjhVcVlJenBqNlMyZnFtbGpTcTVZU25iSE9HNXBoekhMNndQOU8yM042VlVEREpMRXg3SlBlZEhZNGljWFhnb2NPTzI0U0ExNnRUZnJILWswaXM1azZXbUJUaWlZeURUS1VCVi1UMVFxcGxWWUFxX201WjM3cHhvNGs0UlJjNGNBRklBV3Q1RUhDeEdEbWZYdkFZQ1J6RlFhYzlKT2o4Z9IBrwFBVV95cUxNcUlqNFI2V2ozWnlrVjB2ZTVuVmF1RU5GVWROTHZoUVlfbTl5SVZteWJMUHNPWUFfMUNBYUJhWWdzRmxrSnpsRVZ0TkJhVHJCY3JZcExrQlVvT0oxQnp2ZXR2RmpVUXBkM1VRaGVVTHRwWGtlNjJONl9ydjlZVTJLQU42bEw0LUQ2Z3BKNk5QVU1HMkdRaTVsT1htb0dhLXZiWG8xNUc5Wm5IdVdfYUhJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="theme-e FITT_Article_main__body oBTii mrzah " data-testid="prism-GridColumn"&gt;&lt;div class="dHdHP jLREf zXXje aGO eCClZ nTLv jLsYA gmuro TOSFd VmeZt sCkVm hkQai wGrlE MUuGM fciaN qQjt DhNVo Tgcqk IGLAf tWjkv "&gt;&lt;p class="kCTVx qtHut lqtkC HkWF HfYhe kGyAC " data-testid="prism-headline"&gt;&lt;h1 class="vMjAx eeTZd tntuS eHrJ "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;South Lake Tahoe resident tests positive for plague, likely from flea bite: health officials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="QHblV nkdHX mHUQ kvZxL hTosT whbOj " data-testid="prism-byline"&gt;&lt;div class="VZTD mLASH BQWr OcxMG oJce "&gt;&lt;div class="kKfXc ubAkB VZTD rEPuv "&gt;&lt;div class="VZTD mLASH gpiba "&gt;&lt;p class="jTKbV zIIsP ZdbeE xAPpq QtiLO JQYD "&gt;Wednesday, August 20, 2025 8:15PM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="LeadVideoWrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="ScrollSpy_container"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="VideoCaption nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU eEzcu lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;A South Lake Tahoe resident has tested positive for the plague, health officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="XQpSH " data-testid="prism-divider"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB  "&gt;SAN FRANCISCO -- &lt;/span&gt;A South Lake Tahoe resident has &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.kcra.com/article/south-lake-tahoe-resident-tests-positive-for-plague/65824589" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;tested positive for the plague&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Obviously, it's nowhere near as dangerous as it was centuries ago, but officials warn it still needs to be taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;UPDATE: &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7news.com/post/south-lake-tahoe-resident-tests-positive-bubonic-plague-infectious-disease-experts-explain-what-know/17599568/"&gt;What to know about plague after South Lake Tahoe resident tests positive for disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Health officials in El Dorado County believe the person got it from a flea bite while camping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Human plague cases are rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC says an average of seven people a year catch the plague across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It's treated with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Health officials say the person in El Dorado County is recovering at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="uvrxY zOGtW "&gt;Copyright © 2025 KGO-TV.

			&lt;p&gt;Protein is having its moment: From grocery store shelves to Instagram feeds, high-protein foods are everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food labels shout their protein content in bold, oversized fonts, while social media overflows with recipes promising to pack more protein into your favourite dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And according to the International Food Information Council's &lt;a href="https://ific.org/research/2024-food-health-survey/"&gt;Food and Health Survey&lt;/a&gt;, "high protein" topped the list of popular eating patterns in 2024. But does the hype match the science?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes and no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/high-protein-and-fiber-diet-linked-to-longer-better-sleep-study-finds"&gt;High-Protein And Fiber Diet Linked to Longer, Better Sleep, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is essential to good health and boosting protein intake can &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/nutrition-and-healthy-aging-the-role-of-protein-quality-in-combatting-muscle-loss-237112"&gt;support healthy aging and fitness goals&lt;/a&gt;, but the rush to pile on grams – often driven by marketing more than medical need – raises questions. How much do you really need? Can you overdo it? What's the best source of protein?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article breaks down the facts, debunks common myths and answers the most pressing questions about protein today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is dietary protein and why do we need it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is one of the three essential macronutrients your body needs in large amounts, alongside carbohydrates and fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While carbs and fats are primarily used for energy, protein plays a more structural and functional role. It helps build and repair tissues, supports immune health and produces enzymes, hormones and other vital molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteins are made of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22243-amino-acids"&gt;amino acids&lt;/a&gt;. Your body can make some amino acids, but nine must come from food. These are called essential amino acids. That's why protein is a daily dietary requirement, not just a delicious post-workout bonus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike fat and carbohydrates, which the body can store for later use, protein doesn't have a dedicated storage system. That means you need to replenish it regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In extreme situations – like prolonged fasting or severe illness – your body will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-017-0845-5"&gt;break down its own muscle&lt;/a&gt; to release amino acids for energy and repair. It's a last-resort mechanism that underscores just how essential protein is for survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170332" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170332" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/PlantBasedProteins.jpg" alt="Healthy Bowl of Salad with Plant-Based Protein" class="wp-image-170332 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/PlantBasedProteins.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/PlantBasedProteins-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/PlantBasedProteins-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170332" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Plant-based options include legumes, soy products, whole grains, nuts, seeds and even some vegetables. (Aflo Images/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much protein do people need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of protein an individual needs to consume each day may vary based on age, physical activity levels and the presence of health conditions. However, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for daily protein intake is the same for almost everyone: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/77.1.109"&gt;0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day (g/kg/d)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a woman weighing 65 kilograms should aim to consume approximately 52 grams of protein daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An important caveat is that the RDA is set to prevent protein deficiency, not to promote optimal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmy003"&gt;Older adults&lt;/a&gt; who have a reduced ability to utilize the nutrients they consume, &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/6/376"&gt;athletes&lt;/a&gt; whose bodies need more substrate for tissue growth and repair, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/an.115.011817"&gt;pregnant or breastfeeding individuals&lt;/a&gt; whose protein intake is shared with another being, often need more protein. Sometimes as much as 1.2 to 2 grams per kilogram of body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, an older person of the same body mass (65 kilograms) might need between 78 g and 130 g of protein daily, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2013.05.021"&gt;far exceeding the RDA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is there such a thing as too much protein?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While several expert groups agree that consuming more protein can be beneficial in certain situations – &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2014.04.007"&gt;particularly for older adults&lt;/a&gt; – there is probably little to no advantage in consuming protein amounts exceeding two grams per kilogram per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that if you are generally healthy, increasing your protein intake will not shorten your lifespan, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxy197"&gt;cause your kidneys to fail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m2412"&gt;give you cancer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.116.145110"&gt;lead to bone loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When should I consume my protein?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A prominent social media influencer recently claimed that post-menopausal women must consume protein within a very short window (~45 minutes) after exercise, or any benefits from exercise will quickly dissipate and they will lose all their muscle. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1550-2783-10-53"&gt;This is absolutely not the case&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of an "anabolic window" – a brief period after exercise when recovering muscles make the best use of protein – has long been debunked. Perhaps more accurately described as a &lt;a href="https://www.jospt.org/doi/10.2519/jospt.2018.0615"&gt;garage door rather than an anabolic window&lt;/a&gt;, there is a generous period of at least 24 hours to consume protein after exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means your muscles remain sensitive to the muscle-building effects of protein for a long time after exercise. So, focusing your efforts on consuming enough protein each day is much more important than stressing about guzzling your protein shake in the changing room immediately following your workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as you're eating enough protein each day, feel free to consume it on a schedule that fits your daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if increasing the amount of protein that you eat at each meal helps you feel fuller and curb your appetite, you may be a little less likely to overeat or indulge in sweet treats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with the increasing off-label use of Type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="170326" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; medications such as GLP-1 agonists, which significantly reduce appetite, putting protein on your plate first might – and it's a considerable might – help slow muscle loss that accompanies this drastic weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this is rather speculative, and resistance exercise will probably be your best option for slowing muscle loss while on these medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are all proteins created equal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is found in a wide variety of foods, from animal sources such as meat, fish, eggs and dairy to plant-based options like legumes, soy products, whole grains, nuts, seeds and even some vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is also widely available as a nutritional supplement, with whey, casein and collagen being among some of the most popular options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal-based proteins are often touted by many online as superior, especially when it comes to supporting muscle growth, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2025.07.005"&gt;but the reality of protein quality is more nuanced.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal proteins often contain more of the essential amino acids and are more bioavailable, meaning they are easier for the body to absorb and use. However, a well-planned plant-based diet can also supply all the essential amino acids the body needs – it just takes a bit more variety and intention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that wasn't enough, and you find yourself trying to wrap your head around food labelling, you're not the only one. When it comes to high-protein products seen all over the grocery store, meat, dairy, shakes and bars are no longer the only options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_133499" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-133499" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/EatiingProteinBar.jpg" alt="A women in a blue top eating a protein bar" class="size-full wp-image-133499" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/EatiingProteinBar.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/EatiingProteinBar-552x415.jpg 552w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/EatiingProteinBar-600x451.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-133499" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Protein bars and sports drinks are meant to be complements to a healthy diet. (aldomurillo/Canva Pro)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, consumers are bombarded with high-protein popcorn, chips and even candy. Most of these, like diets promoted by influencers, are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/business/health-halo-food-marketing-labels.html"&gt;unnecessary "health halo" gimmicks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My advice would be to follow a varied, whole-food, protein-forward diet – &lt;a href="https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/"&gt;much like the dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. And whatever your preferred protein source – animal- or plant-based – fill about a quarter of your plate or bowl at breakfast, lunch and dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach will greatly support your overall health, especially when combined with a diverse diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains, along with &lt;a href="https://csepguidelines.ca/"&gt;regular physical activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that protein is an essential nutrient, and consuming enough of it daily is crucial for maintaining good health. But meeting your body's protein needs doesn't need to be complicated.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259984/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

There also was a case in Bonneville County earlier this month. “Without any link between these two confirmed cases in North Idaho or travel outside of their communities, it’s reasonable to suspect that there is more measles circulating,” Dr. Christine Hahn, the state epidemiologist, said in a &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://healthandwelfare.idaho.gov/news/measles-circulating-among-idaho-communities-health-officials-urge-consultation-healthcare"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles was &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.idahostatesman.com/living/health-fitness/article311584836.html"&gt;first found&lt;/a&gt; in the city of Coeur d’Alene’s wastewater in late July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 6, public health officials &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.idahostatesman.com/living/health-fitness/article311628436.html"&gt;in Eastern Idaho&lt;/a&gt; reported that a person traveling internationally had tested positive in Bonneville County. Then, on Aug. 12, the health district serving North Idaho &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.idahostatesman.com/living/health-fitness/article311677969.html"&gt;confirmed a case&lt;/a&gt; in Kootenai County — the first known case of measles in the state’s panhandle since 1991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three cases have been in unvaccinated children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we’ve seen with other states around the nation, cases can begin to multiply quickly,” Hahn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas, Kansas and New Mexico are among the states that &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/track-measles-outbreak-cases-us-map-rcna198932"&gt;have seen outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;highly contagious disease&lt;/a&gt; that spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It can survive in the air for two hours after an infected person has left the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a characteristic rash typically appear seven to 14 days after exposure, according to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. Measles can lead to serious complications, especially in young children and people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 13% of adults and 21% of children with measles are hospitalized for the disease, according to Hahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and Welfare and the &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://panhandlehealthdistrict.org/news-release/08-12-2025-first-confirmed-measles-case-in-panhandle-since-1991/"&gt;Panhandle Health Distric&lt;/a&gt;t encouraged residents to verify their family’s vaccination records. Children are recommended to get two doses, once when they turn 1 and once before they start kindergarten, at about age 4 or 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boosters aren’t needed, but if you can’t remember whether you were previously vaccinated, it causes no harm to get the two doses again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="11" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The measles vaccine is highly effective, and for most people, two childhood doses of vaccine is all they will ever need to protect themselves against measles for their lifetime,” the news release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 80% of kindergarteners in Idaho in the 2023-24 school year were vaccinated, leaving about 20% unprotected, according to the annual &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html"&gt;National Immunization Survey&lt;/a&gt;.

Then came the pandemic. The once obscure molecule was celebrated as our salvation, as it served as the basis for vaccines to fight Covid-19. The once-unknown scientists who had advanced mRNA technology &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2023/press-release/" rel&gt;won the Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in 2023 for saving millions of lives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For mRNA, vaccines were just supposed to be the beginning. The technology was supposed to be the holy grail, the thing that would turn our bodies into factories for making the medicines that could cure us of—well, anything, from rare diseases to cancer. “Out of the horror of Covid will come remarkable advances,” said Jeremy Farrar, the then-director of Wellcome, a charitable trust dedicated to healthcare, in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fast-forward to today, with mRNA now facing an implacable foe: Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In 2021 RFK Jr. claimed that the Covid shot was “the deadliest vaccine ever made.” Two weeks ago he announced that the federal government was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/05/nation/rfk-vaccine-funding/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link" rel&gt;canceling nearly $500 million&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in government-funded mRNA research projects. Entrepreneurs who have founded companies to develop mRNA-based therapeutics say the government’s antipathy is causing investors to pull out. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.modernatx.com/en-US" rel&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the 15-year-old biotech company that was founded to exploit mRNA—its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.modernatx.com/en-US/about-us/our-story" rel&gt;very name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a play on the molecule—has lost 95 percent of market value, and it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/07/31/business/moderna-layoffs-cost-cutting-vaccines/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link" rel&gt;plans to lay off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; 10 percent of its workforce. Even before Kennedy’s latest salvo, the government had canceled a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/bird-flu-vaccine-funding-cut-virus-h5n1-biosecurity-next-pandemic/" rel&gt;$766 million contract&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; between Moderna and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to develop several flu vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For mRNA &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/18/opinion/mrna-vaccines.html" rel&gt;true believers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;—and there are still plenty of them—these attacks on a molecule with such lifesaving potential is akin to Galileo’s trial in the seventeenth century for the heretical claim that the earth revolves around the sun, shutting down science and preventing progress.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except that the truth, as is so often the case, is more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Free Press</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Aug 2025 23:18:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQYnhHcTdJY3pVOHZ4SXZuanNmLW85bG1FdGhXOWhLdktTcXFEcUpDTXVxYzJWMkY4dlQwNTBZbnpTLUF0NldneXFyUVNIMVU4WHphRUpTWUQ2SlpFQ19zOGNueHZacWJxU0R0dFNINFc4UXZEa2hVTkx2TnZSMDlsTg</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，食用这些食物可以将胃肠道癌风险降低36 ％ - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE5lNWNzSll1SFZkMDZwMEJVdnlyM2ZsWlF0VHNCeERhbDhBMGhtYnp2TjAtYlhnQnlWU05aWGg3cEVjYkk2aE1GSC1nTlAzc2V3VGpQS2lzYVBMZEdxNDFyOTRhUXlpNDM0VjRubkt1cEQtU1VHOEFEbmVMOA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-generic" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests white-fleshed produce may reduce GI cancer risk by 36%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red and purple vegetables may lower risk by up to 32%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gastrointestinal cancers are on the rise globally and in the U.S.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gastrointestinal cancers include any &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/acidogenic-foods-gi-cancer-study-11739673" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cancer of the GI tract&lt;/a&gt;—stomach, liver, esophageal, pancreatic and colorectal. They represent more than 25% of all cancers, with 5 million new cases of gastrointestinal cancers and 3 million associated deaths in 2018.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; What’s more, the rate of gastrointestinal cancers in people under 50 is rising at an alarming rate, according to a July 2025 report.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As with many other diseases, lifestyle plays a large role in cancer risk. The American Cancer Society focuses especially on diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol intake as areas that have the most influence over cancer risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there is a lot of evidence regarding the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/275617/why-you-should-eat-the-rainbow-when-it-comes-to-fruits-and-vegetables/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;role fruits and vegetables can play&lt;/a&gt; in reducing cancer risk, researchers from Korea wanted to see if certain colors of produce made a bigger difference than others. They published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Nutrition Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break them down.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers enrolled more than 11,000 participants who were attending health check-ups at the National Cancer Center (NCC) in Korea between October 2007 and December 2021. Participants were followed for an average of eight years, during which time 214 gastrointestinal cancers were diagnosed; researchers gathered diagnosis data from the Korea Central Cancer Registry and NCC electronic medical records.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers collected data via two baseline questionnaires. One gathered demographic information, including age, sex, smoking status, alcohol consumption, educational level, household income, occupation, marital status, physical activity and family history of cancer. The other one was a food frequency questionnaire that asked about consumption of 106 culturally-relavant foods, including frequency and amounts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8071224/how-to-choose-the-healthiest-canned-fruits-vegetables/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;classified fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; according to their colors. But instead of going by the exterior color, they went by the color of the flesh. So where some might consider apples as falling into red fruits, pears into green or yellow and bananas as yellow, those examples were categorized as being white for this study, since their flesh is white. This is partly because people in Korea tend to remove the peel of fruits like apples and pears, so researchers felt this was more applicable to real life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After running statistical analyses, including adjusting for demographics, researchers found the following major findings:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers also point out several limitations to this study. First, because it was specifically done with a Korean population, it is unknown if these results extend to other populations. Also, a follow-up of eight years is relatively short for cancer development, so a longer follow-up may offer more accurate results. Lastly, all gastrointestinal cancers were lumped together, so researchers can’t say if certain colors are more effective for certain types of gastrointestinal cancers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While we can’t perfectly convert the 188 g/day of white fruits and veggies into cups, we can get close by offering examples. For instance, 188 grams would be about 1 ¾ cups chopped cauliflower, a large golden delicious apple or two small bananas.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As for the red and purple fruits and veggies, 34 grams would be about two medium slices of tomato or a couple of large strawberries.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These amounts can all contribute to the USDAs recommendation of 2 cups of fruit and 3 cups of vegetables per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;There is good news from Virginia when it comes to the deadly infection sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is truly a groundbreaking discovery,” said Jianjie Ma, a professor in the department of surgery at the University of Virginia. “Sepsis is a very challenging disease to treat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ma is part of the team at U.Va., along with the University of Michigan, that has &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uvahealth.com/2025/08/15/new-monoclonal-antibody-targets-deadly-sepsis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;developed a monoclonal antibody to stop sepsis&lt;/a&gt;. The deadly infection impacts up to 50 million people worldwide every year, killing about 11 million people, according to researchers. It’s the leading cause of death in U.S. hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a really urgent matter in the hospital, because when patients are admitted to the hospital, they have to be treated right away,” he said. “Any delay, one hour delay will cost 5% to 10% chance of people dying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.Va. has received $800,000 from the research company Virginia Catalyst to launch a clinical trial of the antibody at U.Va. Health and Virginia Commonwealth University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our technology will, can stop the dying process by targeting the very innate immune defense of our body,” Ma said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the antibody has the potential to treat a range of inflammatory conditions, including autoimmune disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are ready, and we have a lot of goals ahead of us,” Ma said. “It’s a really urgent matter in the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said applications could include deadly acute respiratory distress syndrome, which came to public attention during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as ischemia-reperfusion injury, which is tissue damage caused when blood flow is cut off and restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have now made the antibody drug product available to start the clinical trial as soon as we can,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;With September almost here, tick and bug season is still prevalent. A new tick has made its way into the state of Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The longhorned tick originated from East Asia. The insect first integrated into countries like New Zealand and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the tick has been reported in 21 states, including Tennessee. The first sighting was reported in Michigan at the end of June. Researchers believe that the longhorned tick arrived in the US most likely on the backs of cattle and other livestock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say these diseases carry a bacterial infection that can cause severe symptoms. Dr. Jermaine Hogstrom with CHI Memorial Hospital says a bite might cause "a very high fever." He says blood work would possibly "show a very low count of blood plates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This disease has become so prevalent that it ranges from New York to Arkansas. The CDC reports that there has been more emergency room visits over tick bites this July than over the past 8 years combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing early signs and symptoms is crucial. Dr. Hogstrom says normally, tick bites might cause discomfort. He adds that the bite "may develop redness around the sight." If a rash develops around the bite or on your body within 3 to 4 weeks of the bite, Dr. Hogstrom says that is more concerning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommends others take extra precautions when outdoors. He says to use tick repellent spray and "try to wear long-sleeve pants and long-sleeve shirts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do remove the tick at home, Dr. Hogstrom recommends using needle nose tweezers and put the tick in a plastic bag, so it can be properly identified later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hogstrom says to seek medical attention as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rolling out a yoga mat and flowing with your breath could be one of the best exercises for improving sleep in the long run.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A meta-analysis of 30 randomized controlled trials has revealed that regular, high-intensity yoga is more strongly associated with improved sleep than walking, resistance training, combination exercise, aerobic exercise, or traditional Chinese exercises, like qi gong and tai chi.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The trials included in the analysis came from more than a dozen countries and involved over 2,500 participants with sleep disturbances across all age groups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-4-simple-exercises-could-help-break-your-insomnia"&gt;&lt;b&gt;These 4 Simple Exercises Could Help Break Your Insomnia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When researchers at the Harbin Sport University in China crunched the numbers, they found that high-intensity yoga for less than 30 minutes, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;twice a week, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;was the best exercise antidote for poor sleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking was the next best form of physical activity, followed by resistance exercise. &lt;span&gt; Positive results were seen in as few as 8 to 10 weeks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The findings are somewhat inconsistent with a 2023 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.43595"&gt;&lt;span&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which found that aerobic exercise or mid-intensity exercise three times a week is the most effective way to improve sleep quality in individuals with sleep disturbances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; One of the studies included in that trial, however, did find that yoga had more significant effects on sleep outcomes than other exercise types.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What's more, yoga can be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/well/move/does-yoga-qualify-as-an-aerobic-workout.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;difficult to categorize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; as either aerobic or anaerobic, and its intensity can vary depending on the technique used. Perhaps these differences in practice can explain why the outcomes differ from trial to trial.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most recent meta-analysis cannot explain why yoga may be particularly beneficial for sleep, but several possibilities exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not only can yoga raise the heart rate and push the muscles, it can also regulate breathing. Research &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-5225-2788-6.ch005"&gt;&lt;span&gt;indicates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that breath control can activate the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasympathetic_nervous_system"&gt;parasympathetic nervous system&lt;/a&gt;, which is involved in 'rest and digestion'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/hm.hm_78_19"&gt;&lt;span&gt;studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; even suggest yoga regulates brainwave activity patterns, which could &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.33745/ijzi.2023.v09ispl2.006"&gt;&lt;span&gt;promote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; deeper sleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But while &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-better-sleep-this-one-piece-of-advice-seems-to-work-for-almost-everybody"&gt;&lt;span&gt;robust&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/bad-night-of-sleep-this-20-minute-fix-can-do-wonders"&gt;&lt;span&gt;evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggests that exercise in general is beneficial for sleep, studies that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-4-simple-exercises-could-help-break-your-insomnia"&gt;&lt;span&gt;compare specific exercises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and their long-term effects are lacking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Caution should be exercised when interpreting findings from studies on sleep disturbances, given the limited number of studies included and the unique characteristics of the sleep disturbances population," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s41105-025-00596-7"&gt;warn&lt;/a&gt; researchers at Harbin Sport University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our bodies and brains are all different, and there's no one-size-fits-all solution to insomnia or other sleep disturbances. Sweating on a yoga mat is just one available option of many.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s41105-025-00596-7"&gt;Sleep and Biological Rhythms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Meanwhile, local outbreaks tend to happen about three months after summer temperatures peak and roughly one month after peak rainfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published today in &lt;i&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, paints a clearer picture of the relationship between the mosquito-borne disease and climatic conditions in the Americas, a region that saw a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00626-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00626-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;record-breaking&lt;/a&gt; 13 million cases in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dengue is caused by four closely related viruses and spread by the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03660-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03660-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; species mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt;. There is no &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03453-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03453-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;specific treatment&lt;/a&gt;, and the disease can lead to fever, bone pain and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research relied on roughly three decades of surveillance data from 14 countries. Cases in the region tended to rise and fall in sync, on average six months apart, even in places as far as 10,000 kilometres apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are “useful to anticipate when a region might expect to see an epidemic, which can help inform planning and preparedness”, says Talia Quandelacy, a co-author and an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the University of Colorado School of Public Health in Aurora. She notes that, although the link between &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02423-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02423-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;dengue and climate&lt;/a&gt; is well known, what stands out in the findings is how this association plays out across the entire continent, “especially given that it’s such a climatically diverse region”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Toasty mosquitoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
