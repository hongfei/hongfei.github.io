    &lt;p&gt;With its mild flavor and high water content, zucchini may not seem like a nutritional standout. But this summer fruit (yes, it’s a fruit) can help lower inflammation, support clearer vision and promote metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at all that zucchini has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; It contains powerful antioxidants. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For centuries, zucchini has been used in traditional medicine because of its anti-inflammatory, antiviral and antimicrobial properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, scientists link these benefits to the antioxidants in zucchini, including vitamin C, beta carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin, which help protect cells from free radical damage and enhance immune function. Half a medium zucchini contains about 15 milligrams of vitamin C, which is nearly 20% of the daily recommended amount for adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin are also carotenoids, pigments that give zucchini its bright green skin. Carotenoids can help regulate the production of inflammatory cytokines, said Taylor Wallace, a food scientist and adjunct clinical associate professor at George Washington University. Cytokines act as chemical messengers in the immune system, signaling cells to respond to infection or injury. At healthy levels, cytokines keep us from getting sick, but too many or too few can drive excess inflammation and lead to diseases like cancer, Wallace explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While dark, leafy greens and berries are richer in carotenoids and other antioxidants, zucchini’s advantage lies in its versatility. It can be prepared in all sorts of ways, and its mild taste makes it an easy filler or substitute ingredient (think “zoodles”) that packs a nutritional punch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zucchini may not be a particularly “glamorous vegetable,” but it’s inexpensive to buy and easy to grow yourself, added Christopher Gardner, the director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; It’s good for your vision. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lutein and zeaxanthin are essential for eye health. They build up in a part of the eye called the macula and help protect eye cells from damage. Over time, these nutrients can help keep vision sharp and stave off age-related macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of blindness in older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One cup of zucchini contains a little over 2 milligrams of lutein and zeaxanthin, which is about 17% of what experts recommend daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; It can help keep blood pressure in check. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the cells in your body to function properly, two minerals need to stay in balance: potassium and sodium. Unfortunately, “almost no one” gets enough potassium, Wallace said. And almost everyone gets too much sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium is key to managing blood pressure and offsetting the effects of too much sodium, said Maya Vadiveloo, a dietitian and associate professor of nutrition at the University of Rhode Island. Half a medium zucchini contains about 4% of the recommended daily amount, which is similar to what you’d find in half a banana. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Zucchini fills you up, but it isn’t calorie-dense. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to being 95% water, zucchini is low in sugar, calories and fat. Research suggests that energy density — the number of calories per unit of food weight — shapes how much we eat, how satiated we feel and our long-term health. The lower the calories-to-volume ratio, the better. Regularly eating water-rich, lower-energy-density foods can help you feel full and curb the risk of chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bulking up your plate with zucchini or other nonstarchy vegetables is a great way to reduce how much you’re eating without feeling like you’re depriving yourself,” Vadiveloo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; What’s the best way to eat zucchini? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any form — raw, grilled, puréed, roasted, sautéed, spiralized — is healthy, experts said, though there are a few things to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t peel zucchini’s verdant skin, because it’s packed with nutrients. Heat can degrade some important compounds, like vitamin C. And the lutein and zeaxanthin in zucchini are fat-soluble, so they’re best absorbed with a little olive oil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Meanwhile, vaccine exemptions reached a record high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These statistics became all the more disturbing last fall when, shortly after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/health/child-vaccinations-decline-cdc.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;286,000 children&lt;/a&gt; began their educations without proof of full immunity against measles, a man who has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/us/politics/trump-anti-vax.html#:~:text=A%20long%20and%20complicated%20history%20with%20vaccines&amp;amp;text=In%202007%2C%20she%20wrote%2C%20he,happened%20to%20take%20the%20vaccine.%E2%80%9D" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;bragged about never getting a flu shot&lt;/a&gt; was re-elected to the presidency.

In doing so, they risk endangering millions of people and kickstarting a doom loop of mistrust from which it could take decades to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As usual, the Trump administration’s stance on vaccines is motivated less by sincere populism and more by personal profit. Before Kennedy launched his own presidential campaign on a platform of “making America healthy again”, he earned &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/12/03/rfk-jr-maha-pay-vaccine-group-childrens-health-defense/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$20,000 every week&lt;/a&gt; helming a non-profit dedicated to fostering vaccine skepticism. Now in the cabinet, he has fired the entire &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/09/rfk-jr-to-fire-all-members-of-the-cdcs-vaccine-advisory-committee-00395235" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC vaccine advisory panel&lt;/a&gt; and replaced them with a ragtag crew, half of whom have &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/members-rfk-jr-s-new-vaccine-committee-have-published-little-vaccines" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;never published peer-reviewed research&lt;/a&gt; on vaccines. Just last week, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/05/nx-s1-5493550/rfk-jr-funding-mrna-vaccine-development" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cancelled $500m of federal funding&lt;/a&gt; for mRNA vaccines, which &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9537923/#:~:text=They%20determined%20the%20number%20of,COVID%E2%80%9019%20in%20a%20year." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;prevented 14m deaths&lt;/a&gt; during the Covid-19 pandemic. And he has made these rollbacks while &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-confirmation-robert-f-kennedy-merck/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;retaining a financial stake&lt;/a&gt; in ongoing litigation against a vaccine manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All the while, the US has seen more than &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;1,300 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; and three deaths this year. In response, Kennedy has alternately &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5354900/hhs-rfk-endorses-mmr-measles-vaccine-stoking-supporters-fury" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;endorsed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;undermined&lt;/a&gt; the most effective method of prevention – widespread immunization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The evisceration of funding has extended across the sciences, with Trump cutting support for research to a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/22/upshot/nsf-grants-trump-cuts.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;35-year nadir&lt;/a&gt;. At the National Institutes of Health, &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/5437295-nih-broke-law-by-withholding-funding-gao/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;1,800 grants&lt;/a&gt; have been terminated, a move that the Government Accountability Office &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/us/politics/trump-gao-nih-funding.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;deemed illegal&lt;/a&gt;. The administration also continues to freeze grants to universities over culture war phantasms like DEI, including &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-05/ucla-negotiate-nih-nsf-doe-grant-cuts" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$339m at UCLA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/trump-administration-freezes-2-2-billion-in-grants-to-harvard/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$2.2bn at Harvard&lt;/a&gt;. So it’s not surprising that &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/5218404-scientists-poll-leaving-us-poll/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;75% of US scientists&lt;/a&gt; polled by the journal Nature are considering leaving the country, which raises the prospect of a lost generation of American talent and lifesaving innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Internationally, Trump’s heartless and thoughtless budget cuts are causing devastation. The administration &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/usaid-programs-now-run-state-department-agency-ends/story?id=123373289" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;has dismantled USAID,&lt;/a&gt; one of the most successful preventers of contagious disease in history. In doing so, it defunded programs that &lt;a href="https://ge.usembassy.gov/usaid-and-vaccines-helping-save-9-3-million-children-in-the-last-10-years/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;vaccinated more than 800 million children&lt;/a&gt; against fatal illnesses like malaria. Researchers have found that &lt;a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/media/som/news/news-logos/BU-researcher-warns-of-367,000-deaths-from-halted-USAID-programs_.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;300,000 people have already died&lt;/a&gt; because of these cuts, which could lead to another &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/07/01/nx-s1-5452513/trump-usaid-foreign-aid-deaths" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;14m preventable deaths&lt;/a&gt; over the next five years – all to gut an agency that managed the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/usaid-cuts-lead-14-million-deaths-five-years-researchers-say-rcna216095" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;equivalent&lt;/a&gt; of 4% of &lt;a href="https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/fy24_ndaa_conference_executive_summary1.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the annual national defense budget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Back in the US, medical associations, local officials and individual doctors are &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/24/vaccines-access-rfk-cdc/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;collaborating to buy vaccines&lt;/a&gt; directly from manufacturers and lobbying insurance companies to continue covering the costs of those shots. Their efforts reflect a tried-and-true strategy to counter under-immunization. Before the current outbreak, Ronald Reagan-era cuts to public health caused &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/05/13/722944146/how-public-health-outreach-ended-a-1990s-measles-outbreak-and-whats-different-no" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a more widespread measles pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, with 27,000 cases in just 1990. But locally led outreach campaigns and grassroots vaccination programs turned back the crisis, as did an eventual restoration of federal funds under Bill Clinton’s administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Budget cuts can be reversed, but trust may be more difficult to recover. Long before RFK Jr’s ascendancy, disasters like the CDC’s infamous &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/about/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Untreated Syphilis Study at Tuskegee&lt;/a&gt; and the Food and Drug Administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.12.1.226" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;glacial response to the Aids crisis&lt;/a&gt; cast long shadows over public health institutions. Today, a plurality of Americans &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/poll-many-americans-say-they-will-lose-trust-in-public-health-recommendations-under-federal-leadership-changes/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;are already predicting&lt;/a&gt; they will lose faith in medical guidance under the current administration. That would undermine the very basis of public health, which depends on people choosing to follow guidelines grounded in research they did not personally conduct and whose results they are ill-trained to parse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Repairing that breach will require years of effortful relationship-building, but it might also require rallying Americans with the classic tactic of patriotism. For all of Trump’s bellicose rhetoric, he misses that our nation’s most extraordinary scientific and medical advances have drawn bipartisan enthusiasm in part because they reinforced a perceived American exceptionalism. At the height of the cold war, RFK Jr’s uncle &lt;a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/we-choose-go-moon-jfks-moon-shot" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;chose to go to the moon&lt;/a&gt;, and Richard Nixon &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/history/55-years-ago-president-nixon-establishes-space-task-group-to-chart-post-apollo-plans/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;brought that dream to fulfilment&lt;/a&gt;. After Franklin Delano Roosevelt founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, Americans helped fund it by &lt;a href="https://time.com/5062520/march-of-dimes-history/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;mailing in more than 2.5m dimes&lt;/a&gt;, hence its christening as the March of Dimes. That money supported Jonas Salk’s development of the polio vaccine. Within two years of its introduction, annual cases of polio had &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/history-of-vaccination/history-of-polio-vaccination" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fallen by 90%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even Trump, who &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/29/opinions/ways-trump-botched-covid-response-holtgrave" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;botched the initial response&lt;/a&gt; to Covid-19, managed to oversee &lt;a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/article/2309561/trump-administration-collaborates-with-moderna-to-produce-100-million-doses-of/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the historic Operation Warp Speed&lt;/a&gt;.

      &lt;p&gt;Eleanor Ceres found out she had lung cancer after the tumor spread from her chest and began protruding out her neck.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Born and raised in Cape Town, South Africa, Ceres has been smoking for over 30 years — and smoking causes &lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21834" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nearly three-quarters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of lung cancer deaths around the world.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Why wasn't she diagnosed earlier? Prior to the tumor's manifestation, her only symptom had been a sore arm, which the doctors chalked up to arthritis. By the time she was diagnosed in April 2024, the cancer had advanced to Stage 4 and was terminal. Doctors could only offer palliative care, easing her pain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I've got a child around 12 years old. I want to see her grow up and get married and have her own children," says Ceres, a single mother. "I cry a lot because I'm gonna die and everybody's gonna stay alive."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The story of Ceres holds clues to a puzzling issue involving lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's the deadliest cancer &lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21834" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in the world&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, killing 1.8 million people each year — more than any other cancer. But the official statistics suggest that isn't the case in sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, based on mortality rates, it seems that lung cancer is only a problem in South Africa — the &lt;a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPD@WEO/AFQ/DZA/ZAF/MAR/NGA/EGY?year=2019" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;richest country&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the region — and, in particular, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1877782117301637?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Western Cape&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — the province with the &lt;a href="https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/western-cape/state-of-sa-hospitals-western-cape-has-most-efficient-health-care-in-country-but-fears-grow-of-deterioration-5239603c-6698-400c-9d53-44f8ce144dca" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most efficient&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(02)11820-4/fulltext#:~:text=The%20Western%20Cape%20has%20had,proportion%20than%20any%20other%20province." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;well-resourced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; health care system.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But experts say these statistics hide the real story: how lung cancer is being grossly undercounted across sub-Saharan Africa. While smoking is slightly higher in &lt;a href="https://africa.businessinsider.com/local/lifestyle/top-10-african-countries-that-have-the-most-smokers/dl63tzv" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;South Africa&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; compared to its neighbors, that's only half the story, according to Dr. Coenie Koegelenberg, a pulmonologist at Tygerberg Hospital in Cape Town. "We have the most accurate stats because we actually diagnose lung cancer," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-77205" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Africa's hidden lung cancer epidemic, as Koegelenberg calls it, is part of a larger crisis in global health, as infectious diseases like tuberculosis and HIV have increasingly &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30925-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;come under control&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) become an existential threat.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.35458" target="_blank"&gt;Africa's cancer burden, for example, is expected to more than double by 2050&lt;/a&gt;, from 370,000 new cases a year to 940,000 cases. However, &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/272534/WHO-NMH-NVI-18.8-eng.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;only 1%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of global health funding is allocated to preventing and treating NCDs in low- and middle-income countries, despite accounting for two-third of annual deaths.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lung cancer offers a case study for how these countries can succeed or fail in addressing NCDs, given that this disease can usually be prevented through smoking cessation or even &lt;a href="https://press.rsna.org/timssnet/media/pressreleases/14_pr_target.cfm?ID=2380" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cured&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with regular screening and early treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Instead, systemic undercounting and resource constraints have allowed the disease to grow unchecked across sub-Saharan Africa. "If you don't report things and put your head in the sand, that doesn't mean it's not there," Koegelenberg says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why lung cancer goes undiagnosed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are almost no nerve endings in the lungs, so in the early stages, the most common symptom of lung cancer is no symptom at all, says Dr. Keertan Dheda, a pulmonologist at Groote Schuur Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And when symptoms do appear, they are often quite generic — chest pain, coughing up blood, and difficulty breathing. So, doctors in sub-Saharan Africa often misdiagnose lung cancer patients as having tuberculosis, given the &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/tuberculosis-tb" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;high burden&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the region, Dheda continues.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Patients would go through the whole treatment regimen for tuberculosis and not really be investigated for lung cancer," says Lorraine Govender, a nurse and the national manager of health promotion at The Cancer Association of South Africa. Those lost six to nine months of possible treatment can be deadly, since &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/lung-cancer/survival" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;55% of people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with lung cancer die within a year, according to Cancer Research UK "The lack of training for health care providers to identify lung cancer is a big problem," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis may play an even more direct role, given that patients with this disease are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8836400/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;twice as likely&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to get lung cancer than those without — likely due to this bacterial disease causing lung inflammation and DNA damage.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;HIV is also implicated in lung cancer since this virus weakens patients' immune systems, leaving them less able to fend off respiratory diseases or kill budding cancer cells, according to Koegelenberg. His own research shows that, among &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27384354/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lung cancer patients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, those with HIV tend to be younger and have more advanced cancer than those without HIV. "Lung cancer is but one spoke in the wheel of colliding epidemics," Koegelenberg says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Given these challenges, many lung cancer patients die misdiagnosed, and their real cause of death is rarely known, given poor infrastructure to certify deaths and their causes. "In Africa, where we don't have the screening and diagnosis available, we may see deaths from cancer but not know what cancer the patient actually died from," Govender says, "or maybe have deaths and not know it was cancer."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Autopsies could help answer these questions but are rarely performed for religious and cultural reasons, says Dr. Kelechi Okonta, a cardiothoracic surgeon at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital in Nigeria. The World Health Organization thus assessed that &lt;a href="https://www.afro.who.int/news/whats-cause-certifying-deaths-sub-saharan-africa" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;two-thirds of countries&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Africa don't have reliable data on births, deaths, and cause of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Okonta thinks sub-Saharan Africa is in a catch-22 on lung cancer, where systemic undercounting leads to limited data and limited data allows governments to ignore this disease and the need for better record-keeping. "There is no intentional activity by any government at any level. There is no lung cancer registry, there is no lung cancer group, there is no lung research grant, there is no lung cancer unit, even in the hospitals," says Okonta. "They think it's not a problem."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The other side of the problem is timely diagnosis. While the Western Cape and South Africa lead the region in spotting lung cancer, for most patients, it comes too late. Data from the largest hospital in the Western Cape showed that, in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9250306/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;94%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of patients with lung cancer had advanced, incurable disease at the time of diagnosis. There's always an ethical dilemma around asking someone with advanced lung cancer to stop smoking, says Dr. Ayanda Trevor Mnguni, head of the department of internal medicine at Khayelitsha District Hospital in South Africa and a pulmonologist. "Once you are actually so far gone, there's really no point."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-77206" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Dr. Ayanda Trevor Mnguni is the head of internal medicine at Khayelitsha District Hospital, where he treats lung cancer patients. He says that the diagnosis almost always comes so late in the progression of the cancer that only palliative care can be offered to relieve pain.

Especially &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4382920/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;at risk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are communities like Khayelitsha, a racially segregated township on the outskirts of Cape Town, as tobacco companies often flood poor areas with cheap cigarettes and aggressive marketing. It's a sprawling maze of makeshift homes — of cardboard, wood and corrugated metal — over &lt;a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/new-york/manhattan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;twice&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sikhulasonke.org.za/about-khayelitsha.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;as dense&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as Manhattan, with an estimated &lt;a href="https://borgenproject.org/life-inside-worlds-largest-slums/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2.4 million residents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;At Khayelitsha District Hospital, patients in blue gowns regularly step outside to have a smoke. Mbulelo Shicani, a lung cancer patient here, says that he buys a pack of cigarettes for 10 rand, or 50 cents, and that these prices have actually been &lt;a href="https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/tobaccocontrol/29/Suppl_4/s267.full.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;coming down&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Local shop owners also never turn away customers since they're too young, Shicani continues.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We obviously diagnose lung cancer a lot better compared to the rest of the country and the rest of the continent," Mnguni says, given that the Western Cape has the strongest health care system in South Africa and perhaps all of sub-Saharan Africa. "But that doesn't mean much if smoking rates continue to rise," he says, and the disease is almost always so advanced that the only option is palliative care.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; and lung cancer patients only receive palliative care upon diagnosis" — For those in Khayelitsha, they're almost always facing such advanced disease that "we don't even refer them to the oncologist," Mnguni says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why screening isn't an easy solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One way to find tumors and treat them early is with &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6790462/#" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lung cancer screening&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, especially given that &lt;a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/07/23/2024/africa-big-pharma-push-cancer-early-detection" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pharmaceutical companies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, such as AstraZeneca and Chinese firm BGI Genomics, see Africa as a key region for innovation and investment. So, in 2019, Koegelenberg and Dheda created the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6790462/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;first lung cancer screening guidelines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in sub-Saharan Africa, and Discovery, the largest private health-insurance provider in South Africa, started covering screening several months ago, Koegelenberg says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That, however, would only serve South Africa's private health care system, which caters to a small, wealthier minority with far greater resources. Dheda openly acknowledges that lung cancer screening isn't practical for the &lt;a href="https://www.thepresidency.gov.za/node/8149" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;84% of South Africans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the public system, or even most other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, "although we should be screening and we know we should be screening," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even if there were enough CT scanners to screen high-risk individuals, there wouldn't be capacity to biopsy nodules and treat all these cases, given budget shortfalls and rapidly growing waitlists. "It's unethical to do the scan if there's an abnormality, and you actually can't do anything about it," says Dr. Sameera Dalvie, an oncologist at Groote Schuur Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The only option, as Mnguni sees it, is public health awareness with comprehensive anti-smoking campaigns and regulations. He points out that Shicani and most people in Khayelitsha don't know that smoking can lead to lung cancer, so governments shouldn't take awareness for granted. "Once people end up with cancer, unfortunately, you're not going to do well," Mnguni says. "For most limited resource countries, the best bet is to prevent people from getting the disease."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This too is easier said than done, given &lt;a href="https://www.iol.co.za/ios/news/tobacco-dealers-cry-foul-over-anti-smoking-bill-6c93f37e-ef45-44e7-aa1d-226f68f54f6a" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pressure from tobacco companies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the need for greater social support to help people manage addiction. "Many people view smoking as a coping mechanism," says Salomé Meyer, one of the leaders of South Africa's Cancer Alliance. "What are you going to offer in the place of smoking when communities are living in stress?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change may be on the way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, Meyer is hopeful about the future. South African lawmakers are &lt;a href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/government/824494/new-smoking-laws-for-south-africa/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;considering a&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.medicalbrief.co.za/new-smoking-vaping-bill-proposes-20-year-sentences/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new smoking law&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that would ban all tobacco and e-cigarette advertising, as well as raise penalties to 15 years of jail time for businesses that sell tobacco to children or at cut-rate low prices. Furthermore, recent research from Vietnam suggests that lung cancer screening might be feasible with &lt;a href="https://www.jto.org/article/S1556-0864(23)01169-3/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chest x-rays and artificial intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a more realistic, scalable option for sub-Saharan Africa, Koegelenberg says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, change hinges on better data collection, from comprehensive cancer registries to a universal death registration system, Okonta says. And that might have to be proactively driven by the healthcare system instead of the government — in order to break the catch-22. "With adequate record keeping and follow-up of patients, we can solve this," Okonta adds. "Maybe the government will start paying attention to lung cancer."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We must stop hiding behind, 'Oh, it's not going to be affordable,'" Meyer says, since the cost of inaction is far too high. "We must just do it."&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Scientists may have identified a way to naturally regulate blood sugar levels and sugar cravings in a similar fashion to drugs like Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice and humans, the key to unlocking this natural process was found to be a gut microbe and its metabolites – the compounds it produces during digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By increasing the abundance of this one gut microbe in diabetic mice, researchers led by a team at Jiangnan University in China &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01902-8"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; they can "orchestrate the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-reveals-a-drug-free-way-to-mimic-the-effects-of-ozempic"&gt;Expert Reveals a Drug-Free Way to Mimic The Effects of Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormone that is naturally produced by the body and which helps regulate blood sugar levels and feelings of fullness. GLP-1's release is stimulated by certain foods and gut microbes, and its mechanism of action is mimicked by drugs like semaglutide (the ingredient behind Ozempic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="171046" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; typically have impaired GLP-1 function, leading to issues with blood sugar control, which is why &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-protein-discovery-could-rival-ozempic-with-fewer-side-effects"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and other GLP-1 agonists work as treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These drugs mimic natural processes in the body, and while they have proved very effective, some researchers want to figure out how to get the body to produce more GLP-1 on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A growing body of research has revealed that our cravings for dietary components originate from signals sent from the gut, a key organ in transmitting dietary preferences," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01902-8"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; the authors in their paper published in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, which genes, gut flora, and metabolites in the gut microenvironment are involved in the regulation of sugar preference is currently unclear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research suggests gut microbes like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phocaeicola_vulgatus"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bacteroides vulgatus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and their metabolites may help shape a person's sweet tooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments, if mice could not produce a gut protein, called Ffar4, the researchers found the gut colonies of &lt;em&gt;B. vulgatus&lt;/em&gt; shrank. This, in turn, decreased the release of a hormone called FGF21, which is tied to sugar cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149407" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149407" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-642x366.png" alt="New Study Hints at Natural Alternative to Ozempic Hiding in The Gut" class="wp-image-149407 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-642x366.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-729x415.png 729w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-768x437.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-1536x875.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-2048x1167.png 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-600x342.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149407" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Diagram of GLP-1 agonist pathway and FGF21 pathway.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which produces them, said it was reviewing its advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;NICE recommends that monitoring, using blood tests and scans, should be offered to the lowest risk cases in England and Wales, where nine in 10 will have no signs of cancer spreading within five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But research has suggested this could be extended to the next lowest risk group where eight in 10 men will have no signs of cancer spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Evidence gathered by Prostate Cancer UK suggests many hospitals have started offering monitoring to this wider group of patients, but a quarter have not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;According to the analysis of data in England, this appears to have resulted in over-treatments rates of between 2% and 24% across different hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The charity estimates this results in around 5,000 men a year getting treatment they do not always need instead of monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some of this could be down to patient choice – men are generally given the option of treatment even if they are at low-risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But the charity said if the NHS was more active in offering monitoring it could help strengthen the case for prostate cancer screening, which has gained traction since the diagnosis of Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;One argument against screening is that the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/tests-and-treatments/psa-test/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test&lt;/a&gt;, used to spot potential signs of the cancer, is unreliable and leads to unnecessary treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Amy Rylance of Prostate Cancer UK, said: "To reduce the harm caused by prostate cancer and build the foundations for a screening programme, we need to both save lives and prevent unnecessary treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She said NICE needed to update its guidance to reflect the emerging evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;One patient who opted for monitoring was Michael Lewis, 63, from the West Midlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2020 and, as it was judged low-risk, he opted for monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Four years later tests suggested the cancer was worsening so he had his prostate removed.

Kennedy Jr. cited to justify &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html" target="_blank"&gt;canceling some $500 million in federal grants&lt;/a&gt; for mRNA vaccine research looked impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data, according to the agency, were embodied in some 400 research papers listed in &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26047485/mrna-vaccine-harms-research-collection-v2.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;a compilation that ran to 181 pages&lt;/a&gt;. The document was headlined “COVID-19 mRNA ‘vaccine’ harms research collection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After reviewing the science and consulting top experts at NIH and FDA,” Kennedy said on &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1952851097019633766" target="_blank"&gt;a video posted on X&lt;/a&gt;, referring to the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration, “HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits” for respiratory viruses such as COVID-19 and flu. “We reviewed the science, listened to the experts, and acted,” he wrote in an accompanying post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class="quote"&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p class="quote-body" data-long-quote&gt;I can say unequivocally that this was the most dangerous public health decision I have ever seen made by a government body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p class="quote-attribution"&gt;— Michael Osterholm, University of Minnesota&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is that so? A close look at the so-called data reveals that the vast majority of the cited papers — all but about 40 — have little or nothing to do with the vaccines. They concern the consequences of COVID-19 &lt;i&gt;infection&lt;/i&gt;, not the shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the papers that do reference the vaccines are studies not of human subjects, but laboratory mice; in some of these studies the mice received the vaccines via injections directly into the brain or intravenously, which is not how people receive the vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt; &lt;ps-newsletter-module class="module newsletter-module" data-id="519" data-module-id="00000198-9abf-dd0c-a19d-9ebf59ca0012"&gt; &lt;div class="module-container"&gt; &lt;p class="module-icon"&gt; &lt;svg class="icon flying-envelope-icon"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-flying-envelope"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;Newsletter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="module-title"&gt;Get the latest from Michael Hiltzik&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p class="module-description"&gt;Commentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="module-disclaimer"&gt; You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/ps-newsletter-module&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s also important is the lack of evidence supporting the agency’s claims. The data packet fails to include well-researched studies attesting to the safety and efficacy of the mRNA vaccines, including some published very recently. Among those is an exhaustive study by Danish researchers of more than 1 million recipients of the latest mRNA COVID booster, published July 28. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That study investigated the incidence of 29 potential adverse side effects from the vaccine, including heart, liver and kidney failure; neurological conditions; diabetes; and arthritis. It found &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26047605/andersson-2025-ld-250146-175285596115093.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;“no statistically significant risk”&lt;/a&gt; of any of them from the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle that is often cited by anti-vaccine agitators as a dangerous side effect of the mRNA vaccines. That condition was most commonly seen among young men, particularly if they had received two shots within a short time span. But for the most part it was mild and short-term; once the booster was reformulated after 2022, the effect appeared to disappear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No deaths from the condition were known to have occurred, and myocarditis effects were more common and serious among unvaccinated people infected with COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor did the agency’s data packet include &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26047632/ioannidis-2025-oi-250049-175285453990814.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;an estimate of lives saved&lt;/a&gt; by the COVID vaccines, led by Stanford epidemiologist John P.A. Ioannidis and published July 25. That study calculated that from the beginning of the global vaccination campaign in 2020 through September 2024 as many as 4 million lives were saved by the vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ioannidis acknowledged that his estimate is “conservative.” Indeed, in 2022 the Commonwealth Fund estimated that in just the first two years the vaccines were available, the shots prevented more than 18 million hospitalizations and &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26047632/ioannidis-2025-oi-250049-175285453990814.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;more than 3 million COVID-related deaths in the U.S. alone&lt;/a&gt;. A 2022 study in The Lancet, a British medical journal, estimated &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00320-6/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;as many as 20 million COVID-related lives saved&lt;/a&gt; around the world in just the first year of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weigh those figures against Kennedy’s assertion that the mRNA vaccines pose “more risks than benefits,” and it becomes evident that decision-making has gone seriously awry at the Department of Health and Human Services under Kennedy’s leadership. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/941921e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/320x252!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f5c0b66/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/568x447!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c6fd17c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/768x604!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5268ca3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/1024x806!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dd60747/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/1200x944!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="COVID deaths" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/744a35e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/320x252!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6a1e1fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/568x447!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5fb4a78/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/768x604!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e036f55/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/1024x806!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aad5698/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/1200x944!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aad5698/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1454x1144+0+0/resize/1200x944!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2F79%2F58d2d1ea40eca6704baaba4b7181%2Fdeath-rates.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;Were the mRNA vaccines ineffective against COVID-19, as RFK Jr. claims? The CDC doesn’t think so: Its figures for 2020 showed much higher death rates among the unvaccinated (solid line) than the fully vaccinated (dashed and dotted lines).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Jake Scott, an infectious disease expert at Stanford Medical School who painstakingly examined the agency’s data citations, they point to “textbook confirmation bias”—the quest for information that confirms someone’s preexisting beliefs. In this case, that someone is Kennedy, whose &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-06-17/with-slate-of-anti-vaccine-moves-rfk-jr-steps-up-his-assault-on-public-health"&gt;record of anti-vaccine advocacy is indisputable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mismatch between the data packet cited by Kennedy and the established facts of the vaccines’ safety and efficacy explain why Kennedy’s cancellation of 22 contracts supporting mRNA vaccine research has been greeted by experts as a senseless and devastating blow against science and public health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have have been in this business for over 50 years on the front lines of public health,...and I can say unequivocally that this was &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/federal-mrna-funding-cut-is-most-dangerous-public-health-decision-ever-expert-says" target="_blank"&gt;the most dangerous public health decision I have ever seen&lt;/a&gt; made by a government body,” Michael Osterholm, an expert in infectious diseases at the University of Minnesota, told PBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the very least, if Kennedy is so convinced that the effects mRNA vaccines are not sufficiently well-understood, the solution is &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; research, not less. I asked Kennedy’s department to respond to criticism of his decision, but received no response.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A few words about the mRNA technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using messenger RNA as an intermediary in their actions, the vaccines instruct the body &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mrna-vaccine-tech-could-transform-medicine-and-cure-diseases-rfk-jr-just/" target="_blank"&gt;how to manufacture parts of a pathogen&lt;/a&gt; that its immune system can recognize and fight. For immunologists, the virtues of the new technology are manifest. Vaccines to combat new pathogens or new versions of existing pathogens can be engineered quickly, allowing them to be rolled out to stifle pandemics before they even emerge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential utility of mRNA vaccines is unprecedentedly broad. The possible targets under study today — including in some of the research contracts Kennedy cancelled — include flu, HIV, hepatitis C, malaria, tuberculosis, and cancer, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01393-8.epdf" target="_blank"&gt;Drew Weissman of the University of Pennsylvania and other scientists told Nature in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Weissman shared the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine with Katalin Karikó in 2023 for their work on mRNA vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., the development of the mRNA COVID vaccine was sponsored by $2.5 billion in grants and purchase guarantees from the federal government to Moderna, one of the two drugmakers that brought out the COVID vaccines, partially through Operation Warp Speed, an R&amp;amp;D effort under the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the agency that Kennedy has ordered to cancel the mRNA contracts. President Trump bragged about the achievement during his first term, but reversed course after the vaccines became the target of fearmongering from the right-wing and the anti-vaccine camp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kennedy’s video on X explaining his decision was replete with fundamental misconceptions about the vaccines, according to scientists and real-world data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As the pandemic showed us, mRNA vaccines don’t perform well against viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract,” he said. But that’s plainly contradicted by the record of lives saved and hospitalizations averted. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7104e2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, which falls under Kennedy’s jurisdiction, show that the average weekly COVID case rate in late 2020 was 347.8 per 100,000 population among the unvaccinated, but 25 per 100,000 among the fully vaccinated and boosted population. The weekly average death rate in the same period was 7.8 among the unvaccinated and 0.1 among the vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He claimed that the vaccines promote the mutation of COVID; “one mutation, and the vaccine becomes ineffective,” Kennedy said. Neither of those statements is supported by science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MRNA vaccines do not cause the virus to mutate — they do that all on their own,” writes Steven Novella, a neurologist and veteran misinformation debunker. “What causes new variants to arise more quickly is allowing a virus to spread uninhibited throughout a population — the more it replicates, the more opportunities there are for new mutations. Widespread vaccination therefore decreases new mutations and variants.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, no “one mutation” causes the vaccines to become ineffective; as vaccinologist Peter Hotez observes, in no known case has a single mutation rendered the vaccine ineffective. Boosters developed for COVID variants have remained relatively effective even as new variants become dominant. Anyway, the virtue of mRNA technology is that the vaccine can be rapidly retooled to meet the challenge of new variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That brings us to the data package Kennedy’s agency offered to defend his decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not the product of U.S. government scientists, although one of its developers, Steven Hatfill, is currently on the HHS staff. Its other chief compilers are identified as Martin Wucher, a dentist ; Byram Bridle, a faculty member at a Canadian veterinary college; and Erik Sass, a nonfiction author. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reached out to all three for comment but received no reply. The compilation originated as material for a book titled “TOXIC SHOT: Facing the Dangers of the COVID ‘Vaccines’,” an anthology of essays by prominent anti-vaxxers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compilation doesn’t  make the case for canceling the research. A paper listed as support for the myocarditis threat, for example, states, &lt;a class="link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26047793/icausality-ntramyocardial-inflammation-after-covid-19-vaccination-an-endomyocardial-biopsy-proven-case-series.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;“no causality can be assumed or established”&lt;/a&gt; linking the condition to the vaccine because of the lack of a control group for comparison. “There is no direct evidence of a vaccine-induced inflammatory response” to the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s action is almost certain to hamstring American science for years, possibly decades, to come. It’s the antithesis of Trump’s claim to put “America First,” for it cedes the development of a life-saving medical technology to Europe and China. And it’s not limited to the development of vaccines for respiratory diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a recent appearance on a podcast hosted by the right-wing influencer Steve Bannon, the newly-appointed commissioner of the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya, declared, “As far as public health goes for vaccines, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB0H2lJPGIk" target="_blank"&gt;the mRNA platform is no longer viable&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bhattacharya justified this statement by noting a rise in public skepticism about mRNA technology. What he didn’t say was that the skepticism was promoted  by Kennedy and other anti-vaxxers denigrating the technology; a competent and responsible NIH chief would be defending a technological innovation, not magnifying disinformation about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that the mRNA platform is likely to be seen in retrospect as a historic advance in healthcare ... everywhere but in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOS25OWF9GT0pudFYzVWowaFFTNnZEc0psR3Rmam51YV9xREc3QXdjUzgxOWdueU5rQWttbmxWZUo0RFZRTXd0STFkSk4tQWNFc2V0ajRyMmF4dGFZeTNQMzZnMmlXM2hzdHlLWTZicFd4NFVReFNzRjNibjMwWmlBRnBtbUQwWFdWT1BCUEJEX1BPeW83cjcyM1VyV18</guid></item><item><title>特朗普此前称mRNA疫苗是“医学奇迹”。“现在， RFK Jr.削减了5亿$的资金- ABC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPLTBSYldjMmZZYUQ1TTRkei1Ba19TbDJUMkUtaXdlaEc4cGxMUXEwQkw1SHh0c2tXbktZN05RNnhOM0lQaGpaVVJqWnpOUEg5SVh4YV9FQm9vd1F5NS0xenRpMlRhVGJlam5MVUc5ZkhvZFJlSEFXYlIwcXVETjNFdnNsLXY1VXZZd1lqQlliQ0FoNFdZbjFvZDBuZlBzb0pEWldUakFwLWxHUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;When the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2020, President Donald Trump referred to it as a "medical miracle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This is one of the greatest scientific accomplishments in history.

&lt;p&gt;Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by helminths, a type of worm. Infection occurs during contact with infested water through activities like swimming, washing clothes, and fishing, when larvae penetrate the skin. Surprisingly, the worm often evades detection by the immune system, unlike other bacteria or parasites that typically cause pain, itching, or rashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this new study, researchers from Tulane School of Medicine aimed to find out why the parasitic worm &lt;em&gt;Schistosoma mansoni&lt;/em&gt; doesn't cause pain or itching when it penetrates the skin. Their findings show that &lt;em&gt;S. mansoni &lt;/em&gt;causes a reduction in the activity of TRPV1+, a protein that sends signals the brain interprets as heat, pain, or itching. As part of pain-sensing in sensory neurons, TRPV1+ regulates immune responses in many scenarios such as infection, allergy, cancer, autoimmunity, and even hair growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that &lt;em&gt;S. mansoni&lt;/em&gt; produces molecules that suppress TRPV1+ to block signals from being sent to the brain, allowing &lt;em&gt;S. mansoni&lt;/em&gt; to infect the skin largely undetected. It is likely &lt;em&gt;S. mansoni &lt;/em&gt;evolved the molecules that block TRPV1+ to enhance its survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;If we identify and isolate the molecules used by helminths to block TRPV1+ activation, it may present a novel alternative to current opioid-based treatments for reducing pain," said Dr. De'Broski R. Herbert, Professor of Immunology at Tulane School of Medicine, who led the study. "The molecules that block TRPV1+ could also be developed into therapeutics that reduce disease severity for individuals suffering from painful inflammatory conditions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also found that TRPV1+ is necessary for initiating host protection against &lt;em&gt;S. mansoni. &lt;/em&gt;TRPV1+ activation leads to the rapid mobilization of immune cells, including gd T cells, monocytes, and neutrophils, that induce inflammation. This inflammation plays a crucial role in host resistance to the larval entry into the skin. These findings highlight the importance of neurons that sense pain and itching in successful immune responses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Identifying the molecules in &lt;em&gt;S. mansoni &lt;/em&gt;that block TRPV1+ could inform preventive treatments for schistosomiasis. We envision a topical agent which activates TRPV1+ to prevent infection from contaminated water for individuals at risk of acquiring &lt;em&gt;S. mansoni,&lt;/em&gt;" said Dr. Herbert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, mice were infected with &lt;em&gt;S. mansoi &lt;/em&gt;and evaluated for their sensitivity to pain as well as the role of TRPV1+ in preventing infection. Researchers next plan to identify the nature of the secreted or surface-associated helminth molecules that are responsible for blocking TRPV1+ activity and specific gd T cell subsets that are responsible for immune responses. The researchers also seek to further understand the neurons that helminths have evolved to suppress.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency said: ‘Before any international travel, make sure you are up to date on your polio vaccines.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The UK’s last confirmed case of polio was in 1984, but it was last detected in wastewater in 2022. The entire European region was declared polio-free by the World Health Organization in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Polio, or poliomyelitis, is a highly infectious nervous system disease spread by the poliovirus, which targets nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain stem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Naturally-occurring poliovirus, or wild-type poliovirus, has been eradicated from the US and most developed countries, while another version derived from vaccines is more common but still rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People carrying poliovirus can spread it through droplets from sneezing or coughing and feces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While about nine in 10 people with polio don’t develop symptoms, around five percent report mild flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, sore throat, nausea and vomiting. This is called ‘abortive polio.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around one percent of patients develop nonparalytic polio, which causes more severe flu-like symptoms, neck and spine stiffness, decreased reflexes and muscle weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nonparalytic polio can progress to paralytic polio, the most serious form of the disease. It leads to intense pain, extreme sensitivity to touch, tingling sensations, muscle spasms of twitching and paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Paralytic polio can affect any limb or organ, but if it spreads to the lungs, it could lead to deadly breathing issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC said in its advisory: ‘Polio can be fatal if the muscles used for breathing are paralyzed or if there is an infection of the brain.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Paul Alexander of Texas (pictured here) was paralyzed from polio at age six.

Pictured above is a child in Pakistan receiving an oral polio vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last confirmed case of polio in the US was in 2022 in an unvaccinated adult from Rockland County, New York, just outside of New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The unidentified individual reported a fever, stiff neck, constipation and back and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further testing found at least 21 positive samples of the virus in wastewater samples in several surrounding counties, though there were no further confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest CDC data shows 92.5 percent of children in the US have had at least three doses of the polio vaccine. Children receive four total doses by age six, which protects them for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additional doses may be given to adults traveling to high-risk countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC recommends children and adult travelers to an at-risk region get a polio vaccine booster and wash their hands frequently to prevent polio from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 05:19:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQZFpsOVcwN1RpNGpyYXFqdU9xdnV3Y3poUU9xQlI5M2JJYm1Sb3RTU2w3TWpybVp2OWl1a1dQbmhiMnY3b0ViWEhaZV9ZcEtMTjd2eW1nS3N3TUZNZFkyb0pOVE1BVDc4RmVMSFAwOGFneEJsRlhfZzRyQWRZWjVRTF9KRm9QSE1saHBIbUVmMHhsOWFpRjU0QUhtTXRaZlZBYl81V2JR0gGrAUFVX3lxTE9fMjdTbWgzMkN6UGNmNUQxdmtva1VkY01XY0Y1MVVWT3lvb3h1b1RGQ1lhQzJBR3VUWjRHdE9yZm9GZ2pJV3ZlTTNqQWRLbWNxc2VNWHdFenVfRnVzNEVJNnk1MEJkcEdjNGpZa1YzR3lqdTQ3dXJ3NXhkeWlEUk90TnhUbVVFejVnSEE2aGIyck5mQlMxdEJHWVIzdi0xVmZIUmVZd2c0UnExVQ</guid></item><item><title>防晒霜真的有毒吗？ –播客-卫报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxNYUVnY0lYM20tRDdCNXY3d2RnVFhxR2QtTW92MURrRDVzZGZlNFd5RXlqMS10OU5qdzVTNDZSNHdnSm1TazROdE1RNnV1RnJ3dk41d2FMTUtBc0xoRlBra3NSZG1sQ294YlZUbFhMQ1Q2SHRHbm5iZEdpUlFtLXFUa3Q3VUNfNFJkTzBjV0pfTE4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNYUVnY0lYM20tRDdCNXY3d2RnVFhxR2QtTW92MURrRDVzZGZlNFd5RXlqMS10OU5qdzVTNDZSNHdnSm1TazROdE1RNnV1RnJ3dk41d2FMTUtBc0xoRlBra3NSZG1sQ294YlZUbFhMQ1Q2SHRHbm5iZEdpUlFtLXFUa3Q3VUNfNFJkTzBjV0pfTE4</guid></item><item><title>新研究证实减肥药物与突发性视力丧失有关- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNZlJUTVNzR3RaRUdIdnVZMmRNak1pR1BCSDRfczZEemdObUNUTTZjNlRjb3dqZ09XUGdpQW1neUk5bUNtbEZyOEoyOV8tQUNEOGNaRWdtaGtaWmp3RmFuNi1IWWg4RzRoLXlaYlVhSnhfTktsNjlqWGxvRHFOek5jWHlHWDcxZFhleXFoYm9CYWR5eWFhaVFOSUJiXzA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro (known as semaglutide and tirzepatide) have changed the way clinicians manage  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="170960" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and obesity around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively known as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/13901-glp-1-agonists"&gt;GLP-1 agonists&lt;/a&gt;, these drugs mimic the hormone GLP-1. This limits both hunger and interest in food, helping users lose weight, and helps control blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But two new studies published today show that people taking these drugs may have a small increased risk of serious eye conditions and vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-like-drugs-tentatively-linked-with-sudden-vision-loss-risk"&gt;Ozempic-Like Drugs 'Tentatively' Linked With Sudden Vision Loss Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what you need to know if you're taking or considering these medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What damage can occur?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy, or NAION, is a rare but devastating eye condition that occurs when blood flow to the optic nerve is suddenly reduced or blocked. It's also called an "eye stroke".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact cause of NAION remains unclear and there are no current treatments available. People with diabetes are at &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0076653"&gt;increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing NAION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other eye conditions that develop gradually, NAION causes a sudden, painless loss of vision. Patients typically notice the condition when they wake up and discover they've lost vision in one eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vision tends to worsen over a couple of weeks and slowly stabilises. Recovery of vision is variable, but around &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/eyenet/article/naion-diagnosis-and-management"&gt;70%&lt;/a&gt; of people do not experience improvement in their vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What has previous research shown?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A previous study from 2024 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2024.2296"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; participants prescribed semaglutide for diabetes were four times more likely to develop NAION. For those taking it for weight loss, the risk was almost eight times higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, the &lt;a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/prac-concludes-eye-condition-naion-very-rare-side-effect-semaglutide-medicines-ozempic-rybelsus-wegovy"&gt;European Medicines Agency&lt;/a&gt; concluded NAION represented a "very rare" side effect of semaglutide medications: a one in 10,000 chance. In a first for medicines regulators, the agency now requires product labels to include NAION as a documented risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the recent studies suggest the risks may be lower than we first thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to NAION, there is also evidence to suggest GLP-1 drugs can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1607141"&gt;worsen&lt;/a&gt; diabetic eye disease, also known as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetic-retinopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20371611"&gt;diabetic retinopathy&lt;/a&gt;. This occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the small blood vessels in the retina, which can lead to vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170962" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170962" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/retina_bloodvessels_642.jpg" alt="retina image" class="wp-image-170962 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/retina_bloodvessels_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/retina_bloodvessels_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/retina_bloodvessels_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170962" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Image of the retina, with blood vessels near the optic nerve. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEEjg34OEY/"&gt;olaaf/Getty Images Signature/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may sound counter-intuitive, but rapid blood sugar reductions can also destabilise the fragile blood vessels in the retina and lead to bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What do the new studies say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two newly published studies investigated people with type 2 diabetes living in the United States over two years. The studies looked at the medical records of 159,000 to 185,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.26327"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; found semaglutide or tirzepatide was associated with a more modest risk of developing NAION than previously thought. Of 159,000 people with type 2 diabetes who were taking these drugs, 35 people (0.04%) developed NAION, compared with 19 patients (0.02%) in the comparison group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found an increased risk of developing "other optic nerve disorders". However, it's unclear what kind of optic nerve disorders this includes, as the medical record codes used didn't specify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counter to this, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.26321"&gt;second study&lt;/a&gt; did not find an increased risk of NAION among those taking GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers found a small increase in the number of people developing diabetic retinopathy in those prescribed GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But overall, participants on GLP-1 drugs experienced fewer sight-threatening complications related to their diabetic retinopathy and required less invasive eye treatments compared to the group taking other diabetes medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies are still needed to understand how GLP-1 drugs can lead to eye complications. A current, &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03811561"&gt;five-year clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; is studying the long-term effects of semaglutides and diabetic eye disease in 1,500 people, which should tell us more about the ocular risks in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does this mean for people taking GLP-1 drugs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;NAION is a serious condition. But we need to strike a balance between these (and other) &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/people-on-ozempic-may-have-fewer-heart-attacks-strokes-and-addictions-but-more-nausea-vomiting-and-stomach-pain-247683"&gt;risks and the benefits&lt;/a&gt; of GLP-1 medications in diabetes care, obesity treatment, reducing heart attack risks and extending lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key lies in informed decision-making and identifying different levels of risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with multiple NAION risk factors – such as sleep apnoea, high blood pressure and diabetes – should undergo careful consideration with their treating doctor before starting these medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170966" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170966" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/glp1_injection_642.jpg" alt="person holding weight loss drug" class="wp-image-170966 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/glp1_injection_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/glp1_injection_642-600x348.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170966" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;People with risk factors for NAION should discuss their use of GLP-1 medications with their doctor. (David Petrus Ibars/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Crowded" optic nerve heads are also a risk factor for NAION. This is an anatomical feature where blood vessels at the optic nerve head are tightly packed together. People with crowded optic nerve heads should also undergo careful consideration before starting GLP-1 medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although NAION can strike without warning, regular comprehensive eye examinations with your optometrist or ophthalmologist still serve important purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can detect other drug-related eye problems, including worsening diabetic retinopathy, and can identify patients with crowded optic nerve heads. It's also important to tell them if you are taking GLP-1 medications so they can keep a close watch on your eye health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00417-021-05522-4"&gt;Emerging research&lt;/a&gt; also suggests that improving your heart health might help reduce risks of developing NAION. This includes proper management of high blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol – all conditions that compromise the small blood vessels feeding the optic nerve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13164670"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; also show patients with heart conditions who better adhere to their medication prescriptions have lower risks of NAION than those who don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors should discuss NAION risks during prescribing decisions and work with eye care providers to monitor regularly for diabetic eye disease. Patients need clear instructions to seek immediate medical attention for sudden vision loss and the need for regular eye examinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggressive treatment of sleep apnoea and other heart conditions may also help reduce NAION risks. But for now, there remains an ongoing need for more research to understand how GLP-1 medications can affect the eye.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262874/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;MOORHEAD — The Moorhead City Council further delayed aerial spraying for mosquito control after residents expressed concern for a spray’s effect on pollinators like butterflies and bees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Aug. 11, council members discussed aerial spraying after resident backlash to a planned aerial spray. Most residents who spoke during the meeting expressed concern about the practice, but some asked the city to conduct the citywide spray.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;While aerial spraying is postponed for now, in a press release sent shortly after the meeting ended, the city alerted residents to a ground spray starting at 8 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city planned to conduct an aerial spray Thursday, Aug. 7, due to an increase in the mosquito-borne disease West Nile virus detected in the area. However, the

      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Monday’s meeting, Mayor Shelly Carlson explained it was not postponed due to resident opposition. The city of Moorhead requires pesticide chemicals to be applied in lesser concentrations than neighboring Fargo, and the logistics of switching the chemicals ultimately delayed the spray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After more than an hour of discussion, the Moorhead City Council voted 5-4 to delay the spray to take another look at its mosquito control policy. Council members Nicole Mattson, Heather Nesemeier, Deb White and Lisa Borgen voted for the delay, while Council Members Ryan Nelson, Emily Moore, Sebastian McDougall and Chuck Hendrickson voted against it. Mayor Shelly Carlson cast the tiebreaking vote to delay aerial spraying.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    
      &lt;p&gt;The discussion was brought forward by Borgen and Mattson. Borgen said she wants more information about aerial spraying. While residents can opt out of ground spraying by a truck, they cannot opt out of a citywide spray.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;“I think that’s an issue that we need to visit a little bit more about, get some more data, etc.,” Borgen said.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Mattson argued against aerial spraying, sharing statistics about West Nile virus and the effectiveness of aerial spraying. Most residents reaching out to her about the spray were against it, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore argued the city should stick to its policy and conduct the spray because of the risk of West Nile virus, which can be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Personally, I can’t stomach a death in our community because we fail to take action and protect human health and safety,” Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;

            Health officials in New York City say a cluster of Legionnaires’ disease in Central Harlem has grown to 90 cases, including three deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme7sbg4600053b6nl44gsl77@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The update comes days after New York City’s health department proposed &lt;a href="https://a856-cityrecord.nyc.gov/RequestDetail/20250801026" target="_blank"&gt;new regulations&lt;/a&gt; for the testing of cooling towers, which they suspect are linked to the outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme7sbg4600063b6nh54s6bxl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cooling towers are rooftop devices that release mist into the air as they cool large buildings. If the water inside becomes too warm, stagnant, or isn’t properly disinfected, Legionella bacteria can grow and infect people who inhale the mist.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme7sbg4600073b6n5e8i90z7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A Department of Health spokesperson told CNN the proposed rules “were in development well before the Legionnaires’ cluster in Central Harlem.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme7sbg4600083b6n9ksg0af1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Under New York City law, building owners are responsible for registering and maintaining their cooling towers and they’re routinely inspected for compliance. The proposal would set specific time periods for testing and require test sampling be conducted by state-certified labs. It also details monetary penalties for noncompliance, although the posted documents didn’t specify amounts. Currently, building owners who fail to follow routine maintenance rules &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcodelibrary.amlegal.com%2Fcodes%2Fnewyorkcity%2Flatest%2FNYCrules%2F0-0-0-97837&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjamie.gumbrecht%40cnn.com%7C9e363dfd931149f02ed708ddd92ddbf8%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638905513164878258%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=0%2F%2BxHWeOkliDcXUXNb4pi1Xde34H1LmfVCid19Q4aic%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;face fines&lt;/a&gt; of $500 to $2,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme7saoi300003b6nph0ndfrb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The proposed changes to testing and fines, however, may come with the challenge of enforcement — city data shows that the city conducted a record low number of inspections in 2024, with less than half the inspections of 2017, when inspection numbers were first recorded. The decline in inspections was first reported by &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgothamist.com%2Fnews%2Flegionnaires-inspections-sank-to-near-record-low-ahead-of-nyc-outbreak&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjamie.gumbrecht%40cnn.com%7C9e363dfd931149f02ed708ddd92ddbf8%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638905513164929123%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=FuzutEYOhzKptC%2F8%2F8m3FDG3m8BtplTb2CR%2BSdmSPqg%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;Gothamist&lt;/a&gt;.

            The current Legionnaires’ cluster was first announced on July 25. Health officials say all operable cooling towers in the area have been tested, and those that tested positive for Legionella were ordered to be cleaned. The department said it confirmed that the required cleanings were carried out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Legionnaires’ disease causes flu-like symptoms, including cough, fever, headaches, muscle aches, and shortness of breath. It is treatable with antibiotics, but if left untreated, it can lead to shock and multi-organ failure, according to the World Health Organization. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 10% of people who contract the disease die from complications, with older adults and people with weakened immune systems at higher risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A tiny blob of gelatinous tissue sitting in a dish represents a giant leap forward in human brain research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known as an  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-an-organoid" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="106655" data-postid="170301" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;organoid&lt;/a&gt;, it's a living 3D model of a human organ; one of the first to constitute multiple different regions of the brain. Moreover, those regions connect up with each other and light up with neuronal activity, comparable to the brain of a human fetus at 40 days gestation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've made the next generation of brain  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-an-organoid" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="106655" data-postid="170301" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;organoids&lt;/a&gt;," &lt;a href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/news-events/news/johns-hopkins-scientists-grow-novel-whole-brain-organoid/"&gt;says biomedical engineer Annie Kathuria&lt;/a&gt; of Johns Hopkins University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most brain organoids that you see in papers are one brain region, like the cortex or the hindbrain or midbrain. We've grown a rudimentary whole-brain organoid; we call it the multi-region brain organoid (MRBO)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-grew-stem-cell-mini-brains-and-then-the-brains-sort-of-developed-eyes"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientists Grew Stem Cell 'Mini Brains' And Then The Brains Sort-of Developed Eyes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organoids are not full organs, but scaled-down versions grown from cell and tissue cultures in a laboratory setting. Their purpose is to allow scientists to research changes, differences, and interactions with, say, new medications, without needing to probe a living human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially important for brains. The most complex organ in the human body, it is also the most poorly understood. You can't just go around poking a person's brain willy-nilly – you could break something important extremely easily – so brain organoids provide a crucial platform to help understand brain function, disease, and neurological conditions such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="170301" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="170301" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To grow their brain organoid, the researchers take blood and skin cells from living humans to create induced pluripotent  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="170301" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt;. These are cells that are induced to return to a 'stem' state, from which they can develop into any type of cell in the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These stem cells are then cultured to diversify and transform into various cell types from different regions of the human brain, all in their own separate petri dishes. Only once each of these individual regions are sufficiently developed are they joined together with sticky proteins that act like a sort of glue that allows the separate tissues to form connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each organoid is pretty small, consisting of around 6 to 7 million neurons, compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/11-fun-facts-about-your-brain"&gt;tens of billions of neurons&lt;/a&gt; in a fully developed human brain. Though magnitudes simpler than fully developed brains, they present a reasonable model for how the full human brain operates as an integrated network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170309" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170309" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/imaging.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-170309" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/imaging.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/imaging-600x354.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170309" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Imaging of different proteins in the organoids. (Kshirsagar et al., &lt;em&gt;Adv. Sci.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were a few exciting findings. The blood vessels in the connected organoid grew and began to form new blood vessels. The researchers also found evidence of gene expression associated with the different regions of the organoid, and early signs of the development of a blood-brain barrier – the crucial membrane that protects the delicate organ from harmful substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This organoid, the researchers say, provides a new platform that will allow scientists to study and analyze the complexities of brain function over time, which in turn could give important insight into neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions, and help develop treatments thereof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Diseases such as schizophrenia, autism, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="170301" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; affect the whole brain, not just one part of the brain," &lt;a href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/news-events/news/johns-hopkins-scientists-grow-novel-whole-brain-organoid/"&gt;Kathuria says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you can understand what goes wrong early in development, we may be able to find new targets for drug screening. We can test new drugs or treatments on the organoids and determine whether they're actually having an impact on the organoids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202503768"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But it really isn't the case," Macpherson said, per the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is DSV's report so concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Macpherson wasn't wrong — even &lt;span&gt;diligent consumers&lt;/span&gt; who take steps to &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:avoid plastic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;avoid plastic&lt;/a&gt; or other potential contaminants often can't rely on manufacturers' disclosures for everything from what's in our kitchens to how objects might adversely impact household health and the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;DSV's review noted that novel entities evade detection, emphasizing "critical shortcomings in current toxicity assessment, research, and testing methods" to quantify the vast array of adverse impacts on humans — with particularly pronounced effects on reproductive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The way that we've generally done the testing has meant that we've missed a lot of effects," Macpherson observed, and DSV's "Novel Entities: A Ticking Time Bomb" report bore that out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Two million lives and 53 million disability-adjusted life-years … were lost in 2019 due to exposure to selected chemicals," it read, highlighting exposure to lead and occupational contamination as the "biggest drivers of death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Given the framing of the report, "nothing" appeared to be an unsettling answer to that conclusion, but Macpherson advocated for serious research and funding and a shockingly simple partial solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers "obviously don't want less funding" for climate research. "But this we think — really, proportionally — needs more attention," he added, before expressing some optimism about the potential for a straightforward, &lt;a href="http://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/support-eco-friendly-initiatives-by-mainstream-brands" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:consumer-driven fix;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;consumer-driven fix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"There isn't necessarily the need for a massive collective action; it can just be demand for safer products, because people want safer products," Macpherson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tech-newsletter/?rec427MKqDcI8a21U" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for weekly updates on the latest innovations &lt;strong&gt;improving our lives&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;shaping our future&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 23:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQQkxOLVN6T29ONFY3WnliUHhhcjVDWEdZT3ZZY21EV3NJWTB0Z21pYUx0WHVacmFzTmR0aHNZUGlVRkNCWTlISm1Kd1lFQ042Y3pLX2o5Q1RLRHoyWi1UZ2g2VjQtMUZ6RU9nSGRiMFBmV1VpSlBwN2J0Mm9EVjQ5cHF4N0g4OGZVckJNdEpWRFZUQQ</guid></item><item><title>专家警告说，成千上万患有前列腺癌的男性面临不必要的过度治疗-独立报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPQ2drRWdacy1TYXJPTXBqR1RvS0xSLVVRQlZ5eXJBREVaeVhMU3hHMnU2SDdqdER2LVI5bHJEZXdWWkI4WDFuRkMxMWR0OW9uVU9Eam1IbDdTbFV4ZkdmRVRzV3NUUW52cHZBNXF1YXNoSzRydkdhanlrMjZHRHNCNURMU0U1eVZiX0ZQV0doQmdZNHF0OEtjRGpIT3hYOVFxSE9F?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gryCYY sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 dmMyEN"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 fXvmgM"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 hJPJVF"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 lcJUSj"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 laZbyn"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cKWiEj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

But these guidelines have not been updated since 2021, and the Prostate Cancer UK argues they do not take into account advances in testing and diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Vincent Gnanapragasam, professor of urology at the University of Cambridge, said: &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;Active surveillance is the best treatment option for men whose cancer is unlikely to progress or cause them problems in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But NICE’s outdated guidelines have created a deeply concerning wild west on how surveillance is implemented by different health care teams. This inconsistency is resulting in a lack of confidence from patients in surveillance, who may instead opt to have treatment they may not have ever needed, risking harmful side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 fHfZpe"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/11/13/38/202507_The-Chase-TV-Advert-BTS_Morning_Rosie-Lonsdale_65-Copy.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/11/13/38/202507_The-Chase-TV-Advert-BTS_Morning_Rosie-Lonsdale_65-Copy.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/11/13/38/202507_The-Chase-TV-Advert-BTS_Morning_Rosie-Lonsdale_65-Copy.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Michael Lewis was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2020" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-353932"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Michael Lewis was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2020&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Prostate Cancer UK)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the charity, overtreatment rates in England range from 2 to 24 per cent, and it warns that this results in a “postcode lottery” in which some men receive treatment unnecessarily while others receive monitoring as they should. It also found 35 hospitals have created their own guidelines on what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Lewis, 63, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2020. The nurse, from Dudley, said&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;“My doctors told me my cancer was ‘low-risk’ and not likely to spread quickly, so I was put on active surveillance until 2024, when my PSA level started to rise again, so I had surgery to remove my prostate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being on active surveillance meant I didn’t have to have treatment until I needed to. I was able to continue my everyday life with no side effects. I’m glad I was able to get treatment when I needed it, but having the time without it was so valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy Rylance, assistant director of health improvement at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “Thanks to advances in research, we can now tell which prostate cancers require immediate treatment, and which men would be better off being monitored with blood tests and scans – enabling them to delay treatment or even avoid treatment altogether.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the treatments for prostate cancer, such as radiotherapy or surgery, can lead to “life-changing side effects, like incontinence or erectile dysfunction, which can have a huge mental and physical impact on men”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“NICE’s outdated guidance is increasing the likelihood of men experiencing these life-changing side effects,” she added. “It is causing confusion and inconsistency between hospitals in how active surveillance is implemented across England, leading to a postcode lottery of overtreatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charity is now repeating its call for Nice to update its guidance on active surveillance, claiming this could help up to 5,000 men a year avoid overtreatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK's National Screening Committee is currently assessing whether a national screening programme for prostate cancer should be rolled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A NICE spokesperson said&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; “We are committed to ensuring our guidelines continue to reflect the best available evidence and give patients the best possible outcomes. They are developed by an independent committee, including NHS clinical experts, and are kept under review to ensure they remain current.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are updating our prostate cancer guideline, including a review of the recommendations around active surveillance, and will be assessing whether our suspected cancer guideline recommendations around age-related thresholds for PSA tests for prostate cancer for onwards referral from primary care require updating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 23:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPQ2drRWdacy1TYXJPTXBqR1RvS0xSLVVRQlZ5eXJBREVaeVhMU3hHMnU2SDdqdER2LVI5bHJEZXdWWkI4WDFuRkMxMWR0OW9uVU9Eam1IbDdTbFV4ZkdmRVRzV3NUUW52cHZBNXF1YXNoSzRydkdhanlrMjZHRHNCNURMU0U1eVZiX0ZQV0doQmdZNHF0OEtjRGpIT3hYOVFxSE9F</guid></item><item><title>成千上万的男性“应避免不必要的治疗”前列腺癌-泰晤士报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNWFRhMVlXTktuN3FKUHJhQVJSbHVFUDJPQzhWZm1Cb0JrNllvRGZKaDJ3LWQzYzZFUklOaDNxNVBtU3I0c0VIWW1TT0RjWGdmSUlDMXNUN0ljWUxVRllwZldlaXNuM2Nla1NzTjBoNWdnYU43MEYwYm8yelV3QUFvREJ1UTBBY242NG54dHg5WnlZcDZmUmNDR3JqRjN5eEk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 kuowVf"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Up to 5,000 men a year could avoid unnecessary treatment for prostate cancer if “outdated” guidance reflected the latest evidence, a charity has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Overtreatment of the disease with surgery or radiotherapy can lead to side-effects such as erectile dysfunction or incontinence, according to Prostate Cancer UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Men who have a slow-growing &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/prostate-cancer-guide-questions-answered-b3pr9ztmx" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt; diagnosed at an early stage are often advised to undergo “active surveillance”, which is when they are closely monitored but they do not have treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, experts have warned that there is a “Wild West” in how this is implemented in the &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/topic/nhs" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;, because guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) is out of date. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer in men,&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; and there are about 55,000 new cases diagnosed in the UK every year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;When the tumour is slow-growing and unlikely ever to cause the patient harm, Nice advises specialists to implement active surveillance and monitor the patient closely with blood tests and scans.

&lt;p&gt;New research from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health reveals that women who regularly consume caffeinated coffee during midlife may have better chances of maintaining overall health into their senior years. This groundbreaking study tracked thousands of women over three decades, offering compelling evidence that your daily coffee ritual might contribute to long-term wellness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The remarkable connection between coffee and women’s healthy aging&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have uncovered a significant link between coffee consumption in middle-aged women and enhanced health outcomes later in life. The extensive research, presented at NUTRITION 2025 (the American Society for Nutrition’s annual meeting), followed 47,513 female participants from the Nurses’ Health Study over 30 years, gathering comprehensive dietary and health information since 1984.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sara Mahdavi, lead researcher from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the University of Toronto, emphasized the unique aspect of this investigation: &lt;em&gt;examining coffee’s influence across multiple domains of aging over an extended timeframe&lt;/em&gt;. “While past studies have connected coffee to individual health outcomes, ours is the first to assess coffee’s impact across multiple domains of aging over three decades,” Dr. Mahdavi explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that moderate consumption of caffeinated coffee—approximately 2-5 cups daily—was associated with a 2% to 5% higher likelihood of healthy aging. This positive correlation was specific to regular caffeinated coffee, with no significant benefits observed from decaffeinated varieties or tea consumption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Women classified as “healthy agers” typically consumed about 315 mg of caffeine daily during midlife (ages 45-60), equivalent to three small cups of coffee or one and a half large cups by today’s standards, &lt;a href="https://cdn.nutrition.org/article/S2475-2991(25)01522-7/fulltext"&gt;according to this study&lt;/a&gt;. More than 80% of this caffeine came specifically from regular coffee consumption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What defines “healthy aging” in this landmark study&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers established comprehensive criteria to identify women who achieved “healthy aging” status. By 2016, 3,706 participants had met all requirements. To qualify as a healthy ager, women needed to demonstrate excellence across multiple health domains:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reaching age 70 or beyond&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Freedom from 11 major chronic diseases&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Maintained physical functionality&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Good mental health status&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;No cognitive impairment&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Absence of memory complaints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;holistic approach to measuring successful aging&lt;/strong&gt; represents one of the study’s most valuable contributions to our understanding of long-term health trajectories in women. Rather than focusing on single health metrics, the research team evaluated how coffee consumption related to maintaining overall wellbeing across physical, mental, and cognitive dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The analysis carefully controlled for potential confounding factors, including body weight, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity levels, educational background, and dietary protein intake—ensuring that the observed benefits could be reasonably attributed to caffeine consumption patterns.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Not all caffeine sources offer equal benefits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A crucial finding from this research highlights that &lt;strong&gt;the source of caffeine matters significantly&lt;/strong&gt; when it comes to potential health benefits. While caffeinated coffee showed positive associations with healthy aging, the same cannot be said for all caffeine-containing beverages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Beverage Type&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Association with Healthy Aging&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Approximate Effect&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Caffeinated Coffee&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Positive&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2-5% increased likelihood per cup&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Decaffeinated Coffee&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Neutral&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;No significant association&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Tea&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Neutral&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;No significant association&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cola/Soda&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Negative&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20-26% decreased likelihood per serving&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most striking was the discovery that regular cola consumption showed a decidedly negative relationship with healthy aging prospects. Each additional small glass of soda was associated with a 20% to 26% lower likelihood of healthy aging, reinforcing that &lt;em&gt;the beneficial effects appear specific to coffee rather than caffeine itself&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This distinction suggests that coffee’s unique composition—beyond just its caffeine content—may contribute to its apparent health benefits. Coffee contains numerous bioactive compounds, including antioxidants and anti-inflammatory substances that could work synergistically to support long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Practical implications for women’s health strategies&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While these findings show promise, Dr. Mahdavi cautions that coffee consumption should be viewed as just one component within a broader healthy lifestyle framework. “These results, while preliminary, suggest that small, consistent habits can shape long-term health,” she noted, adding that “moderate coffee intake may offer some protective benefits when combined with other healthy behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team acknowledges that the benefits observed from coffee consumption were relatively modest compared to the impact of overall lifestyle factors such as regular exercise, balanced nutrition, and avoiding tobacco use. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that incorporating moderate amounts of caffeinated coffee into daily routines may complement other health-promoting practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For middle-aged women concerned about maintaining their vitality and cognitive function into later years, this research offers encouraging evidence that your morning cup of coffee might do more than just jumpstart your day—it could potentially contribute to a healthier aging trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The longitudinal nature of this study—following participants for three decades—provides particularly robust evidence for these associations, though further research remains necessary to fully understand the biological mechanisms involved and to determine whether similar benefits might extend to other demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

Voles lacking oxytocin receptors took up to a week to develop preferences for peers that normal voles formed in a day, and they often failed to prioritize known companions in group settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These receptor-deficient voles also pressed less to access a peer and were less avoidant of strangers, indicating reduced social selectivity. The findings highlight oxytocin’s dual role in fostering affiliation with trusted companions and reinforcing boundaries with outsiders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bond Formation Speed:&lt;/strong&gt; Oxytocin accelerates the development of selective friendships.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Selectivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Without oxytocin receptors, animals struggle to prioritize familiar peers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Social Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Oxytocin influences both closeness to friends and avoidance of strangers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new UC Berkeley study shows that the so-called love hormone, oxytocin, is also critical for the formation of friendships.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin is released in the brain during sex, childbirth, breastfeeding and social interactions and contributes to feelings of attachment, closeness and trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112162"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne.jpg" alt="This shows friends talking." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/oxytocin-friendship-neurosicne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;“In other words, oxytocin is playing a crucial role not so much in how social they are, but more in who they are social with, their selectivity,” she said. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never mind that it’s also associated with aggression; the hormone is commonly referred to as the “cuddle” or “happy” hormone, and people are encouraged to boost their oxytocin levels for better well-being by touching friends and loved ones, listening to music and exercising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recent studies involving the prairie vole have called this love association into question. They’ve shown that oxytocin, which in the brain acts as a neuromodulator, is not essential for long-term mate bonding, or “social monogamy,” or for parenting behavior, though without it, voles take longer to form such bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists focus on prairie voles because, like humans, they form stable and selective relationships. While most studies focus on mate bonds, the Beery lab at UC Berkeley is particularly interested in selective peer relationships, analogous to human friendships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such studies could shed light on human psychiatric conditions, such as autism and schizophrenia, that interfere with a person’s ability to form or maintain social bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prairie voles are special because they allow us to get at the neurobiology of friendship and how it’s similar to and different from other types of relationships,” said Annaliese Beery, a UC Berkeley associate professor of integrative biology and neuroscience and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beery and integrative biology graduate student Alexis Black, one of two first authors of the study, found that prairie voles that lack oxytocin receptors take longer than normal voles to form peer relationships. Prairie voles that are close friends typically huddle side by side, groom and even sit on one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oxytocin seems to be particularly important in the early formation phase of relationships and especially in the selectivity of those relationships: ‘I prefer you to this stranger,’ for example,” Beery said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The animals that didn’t have intact oxytocin signaling took longer to form relationships. And then when we challenged those relationships by making new groups, they lost track of their original partners right away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The voles, genetically modified in the UC San Francisco laboratory of collaborator and co-author Dr. Devanand Manoli, also lacked the social rewards that normally come from selective attachments — they didn’t work very hard to snuggle up with their friends and were less avoidant of and less aggressive towards strangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In other words, oxytocin is playing a crucial role not so much in how social they are, but more in &lt;em&gt;who &lt;/em&gt;they are social with, their selectivity,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacking oxytocin receptors also changed the regulation of oxytocin availability and release in the brain, which the group documented using a novel oxytocin nanosensor in collaboration with postdoctoral fellow Natsumi Komatsu and Markita Landry, a UC Berkeley professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That helped us understand the feedback consequences of lacking this receptor, and how oxytocin signaling was altered in the brain,” said Beery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published Aug. 8 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What social voles tell us about social humans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beery has long been interested in social relationships in rodents, focusing primarily on the animals’ seldom-studied peer or friendship relationships. While voles are her main focus, she believes studying similar behaviors across multiple species is key to determining what’s species-specific versus generalizable across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To complement her laboratory research, she has conducted field studies comparing social behavior and oxytocin receptor distribution in the brain within and across species in a group of South American rodents and North American Belding’s ground squirrels, which vary in whether or not they live in groups. She also recently began field tests of multiple vole species — there are about 50 worldwide — to compare their social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suspects that in rodents such as voles, and perhaps in other mammals, the formation of peer relationships may have preceded the evolution of monogamous mating relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While most rodents prefer to interact with unfamiliar individuals, it turns out that the majority of vole species we’ve tested in our early trials form peer-partner preferences, which is what we call these selective friendships. So there seems to be this widespread tendency to bond,” Beery said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But only a couple of those species are also monogamous. Someday, I hope to be able to tell you, ‘Do selective peer relationships precede the development of monogamy? Is that why monogamy has evolved so many times in this genus?’ I think this familiarity preference is deeply rooted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beery was a co-author of a 2023 study led by Manoli that threw into question the association of oxytocin with sex and parenting. That study showed that prairie voles unable to respond to oxytocin exhibit the same monogamous mating, attachment and parenting behaviors as regular voles. Those voles had been genetically engineered to have no cellular receptors for oxytocin, and were the same voles used in the current study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while oxytocin isn’t essential for eventual bond formation, additional studies by the same group published in 2024 showed that these receptor-deficient (or “null mutant”) prairie voles took about twice as long as normal voles to establish a relationship with a potential mate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interested in how the lack of an oxytocin receptor affects voles’ friendship bonds, as opposed to mating bonds, Beery and Black conducted three sets of experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one, they tested how long it took for voles to establish a preference for a partner. Whereas normal voles take about 24 hours of close proximity to form a relationship that makes them choose that partner over a stranger, oxytocin receptor-deficient voles showed no preference in that amount of time, and took up to a week to establish a peer preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wild-type animals form this incredibly robust preference within one day of co-housing, but the null mutants have no sign of a relationship after 24 hours. After a week, they mostly get there, and the lifetime partners look no different from each other,” Beery said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our conclusion from that experiment is that oxytocin isn’t required to have a relationship, but it’s really important in those early phases of a relationship to facilitate it happening quickly and efficiently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then put long-term pair-bonded voles in a party-like, mixed-group situation: an enclosure with other voles and many rooms connected by tubes. In such a situation, normal voles would hang out with known friends until they eventually started to socialize with strangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They can all separate, they can all come together, or they can hang out in any combinations that they want,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The wild-type animals keep track of who they know. It’s like if I went to a party with a friend, I would stand near that friend for the first part of the party and then I might start to mingle. The voles that lack oxytocin receptors just mixed. It was as if they didn’t even have a partner in there with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third experiment, they tested the strength of both peer and mate bonding by having the voles press levers to get access to either a friend/mate or a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Female wild-type voles typically press more to get their partner than to get a stranger, in both peer and mate relationships. The oxytocin receptor deficient mutants also press more to get to their mating partner, but not for peer relationships,” Beery said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That makes sense at some level because we think mate relationships are more rewarding than peer relationships, or at least they depend more on reward-signaling pathways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of oxytocin signaling thus not only delays the formation of relationships, but also creates deficits in long-term peer relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, voles lacking oxytocin receptors were also less aggressive toward strangers and less avoidant of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can see contributions of oxytocin signaling to both sides of selectivity,” Beery said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the prosocial side, it’s involved in wanting to be with a known friend or peer, while on the antisocial side, it’s aiding in rejecting an unfamiliar animal. We’ve seen effects of oxytocin on both affiliation and aggression in our other studies in prairie voles, and it parallels human findings on a role of oxytocin in in-group/out-group dynamics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxytocin nanosensors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a new oxytocin sensor developed in Landry’s UC Berkeley lab to determine whether lack of an oxytocin receptor caused increases or decreases in oxytocin release. If oxytocin release increased in these voles, it could potentially interact with a receptor for a similar neuropeptide that is also involved in formation of social relationships, compensating for the absence of oxytocin receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landry, an associate professor in the departments of chemical and biomolecular engineering, neuroscience, and molecular and cell biology and a co-corresponding author of the paper, created these sensors from carbon nanotubes joined with specific single-stranded DNA sequences selected because they latch onto the oxytocin molecule and fluoresce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Komatsu and Landry found no excess of oxytocin in the voles’ brains. In fact, oxytocin was being released in lower amounts from fewer sites in the nucleus accumbens, a key brain region for social reward across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Co-authors with Black, Komatsu, Beery, Landry and Manoli are Jiaxuan Zhao, Scarlet Taskey and Nicole Serrano of UC Berkeley, and Ruchira Sharma of UCSF.

Oxytocin receptor function also contributed to the maintenance of peer bonds, as &lt;em&gt;Oxtr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1−/−&lt;/sup&gt; voles displayed reduced relationship stability and lost selective attachments rapidly in a multi-chamber, group-living habitat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oxtr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1−/−&lt;/sup&gt; voles also showed deficits in general social reward as well as selective social reward for a peer partner over an unfamiliar conspecific. Evoked oxytocin release in the nucleus accumbens was reduced in male and female &lt;em&gt;Oxtr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1−/−&lt;/sup&gt; animals compared with their wild-type counterparts, indicating that these voles do not have a compensatory increase in oxytocinergic signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these data indicate that oxytocin receptors influence the formation, persistence, and reward value of peer relationships.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 21:31:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE1XTnZTSmY0LVczX2tNUVZUZEpheE9Sb1JGN3d6b29ZQXlKc3JuVi1rQUZHVmpLQnY4Ym5wTDEtWHExbmIwbExDUmtocDNFLXNNeUsyRE5zVi1neDZGcnVsOHB6dEdfYjlKbnJxdnNhbFo</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.被医学杂志抨击疫苗研究撤回请求- The Daily Beast</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPRmh5Mmo1YldGNkczN2E4TkJqSms4SHowYnFDS0hIR3B0M3NCRkpoNGg3TTZhcm5ad2xEYzQzZktuNzNVRlhZTlFPa0JzT1VFTks5YlBsNVVvSVljNnduTkxWTmZvN3kwVGhOUUUxOWFYdlBxWlFPeDNwRnVsTHRDUUJhWWpaa3pwZ2YwWjJIdUR0VVctRWVMc3duTEVJSlItVWFTQ1UzU09VcEk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="main-article" class=""&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The editor-in-chief of a prominent medical journal has rejected Robert F.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;China's record-breaking outbreak is in Guangdong province, on the southern coast, with almost all the infections reported in the city of Foshan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the latest update from the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, revealed by the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ep.ycwb.com/epaper/ycwb/html/2025-08/11/content_2974_719894.htm"&gt;Yangcheng Evening News&lt;/a&gt;, officials reported that of the new cases, 1,212 were in Foshan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another 103 cases were reported in Guangzhou, the largest city in the province, while 39 cases were reported in Zhanjiang. It was not clear where the other 33 cases were within the province.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials heralded the figures as the lowest weekly count reported since the peak of the outbreak in the week to July 20 to 26, when they said they recorded 2,940 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a statement to DailyMail.com last week, a CDC spokesman said: 'CDC is aware of the reported chikungunya outbreak in Guangdong Province in China and is currently assessing the size and extent of the outbreak.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency has already issued a level two warning for the area, advising Americans to take advanced precautions when traveling to the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On Friday, Hong Kong said it had detected another two cases linked to the outbreak, taking its chikungunya tally to five infections reported this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map shows the area in China where US travelers are being advised to take extra precautions because of the outbreak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Drones are being used to hunt down insect breeding grounds and spray insecticide (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One was a 66-year-old woman who was reported to have traveled to Foshan alone from July 24 to August 5 to see family, before returning to Hong Kong. The patient began suffering from fever, rash and joint pain on August 6 and went to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has now been discharged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also reported another suspected case in a healthy 22-year-old woman who was suffering from joint pain and fever. She had recently traveled to Madagascar, Mauritius and Malaysia before returning to the territory, and reported having been bitten by mosquitoes during her trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also on Friday, Taiwan reported its first case linked to the outbreak in China, in a woman in her 40s who had recently returned from Foshan and Shenzhen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A day after returning to Taiwan she developed a fever, rash and pain in her limbs. Officials said she was admitted to the hospital. She also reported being bitten by mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chikungunya virus can only be spread via the bites of mosquitoes and cannot be passed from human to human. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People infected with the virus suffer from a sudden high fever, normally around 103 Fahrenheit (39 Celsius), which happens within two to seven days of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They may also suffer from a rash, headache, nausea, fatigue and joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In serious cases, patients may suffer from pain in the hands and feet that is so bad it leaves them struggling to carry out normal activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is rarely fatal, but can leave people with lifelong complications including joint inflammation and pain that lasts for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients who are very young, elderly or have underlying conditions are most at risk because of their weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no treatment for the virus, with doctors instead using over-the-counter painkillers, fluids and rest to ease symptoms. There are two vaccines available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US records more than 100 cases of chikungunya virus every year, with almost all normally linked to travelers returning from abroad before testing positive for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are concerned, however, that an infected individual could be bitten by a mosquito, which would then become infected and pass the disease on to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A total of 45 chikungunya cases have been reported in the US this year, although none have been linked to the outbreak in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 21:02:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOZFhZVDN1ZHdycDdBMTFqVDNQTTNNWlY3ZmI0X1pNc1dHQ05LRFQtOVNzbVNPWHJGSGdCRW5ONEhsSWxkWDFfTGQ5a0dYX1VNZzZCeE9weEdJS3VUTkdKMWJQeGlYblBHWWhhLUREanJQUDlJREVBbUtTck03Q29IVVFsUXhlMUUtRkpEX1RNenNsNDV4dnRwSTRYWmdQdlgydUtJ0gGoAUFVX3lxTE5TS0dwUFlOZURqMm1SbzVNTkxUUlVIRmJQaUlubnN2MkNrdzA4TWVwM3ktamxJV1QxYVlKZnRRXzF3TDFxMllHejF5eXBiMVBFZlE0ODhFQTlVTERDOXBQVlFyX2M2clhVbzNfZTREM1pTM09MLXpaNG8zMnN4MVJLbHJfXzlUOGRMS1h4eHZaOTRuNEJ1QVJ4eGZMQW9fMU9jQTZmQ19icw</guid></item><item><title>Ozempic如何影响肌肉力量：研究-德撒律新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxQbk5XOUNsMmVJMFhFZng3emQ1TVp5WFFZZHBsMnAySEExMzBvQmlhbmtrM05QUTdZcHR0cDdMVlJjWS0wRUlMZlJaRmh6dWJIMTgzV0JoajNHMWJrb2l1c3pxMGVxU2k0bkJxbnVRN2VhcGFnYjFwcXdmY0g3a1Zjd1h1aXkwRzhjYWY5ekNiZUxDNl95VWRwS19Hbkc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body mt-4"&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__key-points-list col-12"&gt;&lt;div class="key-points-list-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A recently completed study indicated potential muscle weakness caused by Ozempic and similar drugs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Such drugs still have significant health benefits like controlling blood sugar and helping people lose weight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The question is whether some people who use Ozempic are more susceptible to losing muscle strength.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Mice aren’t people, but they have a lot in common with humans genetically. And the furry rodents are often used in preliminary studies to help answer questions about where human research should go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;For University of Utah researchers, a recently completed mouse study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/abstract/S1550-4131(25)00331-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1550413125003316%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/abstract/S1550-4131(25)00331-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1550413125003316%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/a&gt; suggests the need to look more closely at whether the popular drug Ozempic and other semaglutide drugs could cause muscle weakness that needs to be addressed for those taking the medications to manage diabetes or lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers hail the medications as a “significant breakthrough in pharmacological interventions to treat obesity.” But they note recent concerns that Ozempic and similar drugs cause “a loss of lean mass, potentially compromising physical function and quality of life, particularly in those susceptible to sarcopenia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle mass, strength and function associated with age. But there are also medical conditions that could lead to worries about weakened muscles, too, the study’s senior author, Katsu Funai, an associate professor of nutrition and integrative physiology at the University of Utah College of Health, told Deseret News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The goal is not to downplay the importance of how Ozempic and related drugs can improve health by controlling blood sugar or causing weight loss, he added. But his team wants to point out that measures might be needed to protect against a potential negative side effect. If further study shows that a drug leads to weaker muscles — especially in a population that might be susceptible already to losing strength — then those folks might need tandem interventions that maintain or build muscle strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Funai said that besides age, recent surgeries, disabilities and other conditions might increase the risk of losing muscle strength. And quality of life is very much affected by muscle loss, which can lead to falls, injuries and inactivity, impacting overall health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="What-the-Ozempic-study-found" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;What the Ozempic study found&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It’s generally assumed that loss of lean muscle leads to loss of muscle mass and weaker muscles. That may not be as straightforward as some believe. The university-led research found those losing weight with Ozempic also lost about 10% of lean mass, though not necessarily from skeletal muscles, but from tissue such as the liver, which shrank a lot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Loss of mass in metabolically active organs, such as the liver, is expected as part of healthy weight loss,” Ran Hee Choi, research instructor in nutrition and integrative physiology at University Health and co-first author on the study, said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But both mice and humans can see organ size change alongside weight without a similar change in function. “It’s unlikely that the observed lean mass loss represents a serious adverse effect,” said Takuya Karasawa, postdoctoral researcher in the University of Utah Molecular Medicine Program and co-first author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But size of muscles and strength are very different things, Funai said. And loss of lean mass is not the same as muscle loss or its strength, either. The researchers found that even when a muscle stayed the same size, it in some cases lost strength, while in other muscles that didn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;What isn’t known — and needs to be studied, Funai said — is whether weight loss can lead to loss of muscle strength in some people and, if so, who would be impacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Funai emphasized again that their work in mice raises questions, but does not necessarily apply directly to humans. For one thing, as the study notes, rodents and people gain and lose weight differently. People with obesity are often less physically active, while having obesity doesn’t usually make mice more sedentary. And the mice were given obesity through a high-fat diet for the study, while people have many different reasons for weight gain, including genetics, diet, sleep patterns and age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Funai said it is very common for people to not realize they have lost strength in their muscles, but when it’s tested, the loss is clear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“When they’re opening a jar or when they have to do flights of stairs that they don’t usually do or have to carry something, then they might notice. It’s something that they may not be aware of” otherwise, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He added that the loss of muscle mass and loss of muscle strength were dose dependent and time dependent, meaning that how long and how much Ozempic was given mattered. And the dose that was higher and where loss was more sustained was higher than would be given to people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It was noteworthy that loss of muscle mass and loss of force or strength weren’t always coupled and that fact was not uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The study points out the need for clinical trials that directly look at whether muscle strength is lost and if so, in which populations, Funai said. And those studies should consider not just Ozempic and other semaglutide weight-loss drugs, but those in development, he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;While studies frequently consider lean mass loss, physical function is an important issue that may not be so straightforward, he said. But it’s critically important for those who may be vulnerable to losing strength and gaining associated risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 20:51:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQbk5XOUNsMmVJMFhFZng3emQ1TVp5WFFZZHBsMnAySEExMzBvQmlhbmtrM05QUTdZcHR0cDdMVlJjWS0wRUlMZlJaRmh6dWJIMTgzV0JoajNHMWJrb2l1c3pxMGVxU2k0bkJxbnVRN2VhcGFnYjFwcXdmY0g3a1Zjd1h1aXkwRzhjYWY5ekNiZUxDNl95VWRwS19Hbkc</guid></item><item><title>创新系统无需加热即可脱水水果- Phys.org</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYEFVX3lxTE1NeFlsdEpyZ1pHUXVLdVJrVkhGeERVQ0FMWjRzbXJrWGw4eHc1dE1PYjNfZXk3OHhoak1Ra2pULUIyMDRTYTc1X21PZzg4VS1WUERNSjd6RFVYTDBrbXI3LQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dried fruit is a tasty snack or sweet addition to recipes, but the water removal process often requires heat and energy. In a step toward more sustainable food preservation, researchers reporting in &lt;i&gt;ACS Food Science &amp;amp; Technology&lt;/i&gt; have &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsfoodscitech.5c00534" target="_blank"&gt;developed a method&lt;/a&gt; for drying food at room temperature by adjusting air pressure conditions and using food-safe calcium chloride.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;In a proof-of-concept, the system successfully dried mango and apple slices to commercial levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dehydrating food turns perishable items such as fruit into long-lasting pantry staples. Most tabletop and industrial-scale food dehydrators use circulated hot air to remove moisture, which is simple and effective but requires a lot of energy. Sun-drying foods uses mostly solar energy but is slow and darkens the final products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researcher Luis Bastarrachea is &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsfoodscitech.2c00433" target="_blank"&gt;developing food preservation processes that don't require heat&lt;/a&gt;. In this most recent study, the moisture-adsorbing salt &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/calcium/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt; chloride, an ingredient used in cheese and molecular gastronomy applications, was incorporated into a room-temperature dehydration method and tested to see if it would impact the drying fruit's color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers built a no-heat dehydrating chamber with three sets of screens above a container of calcium chloride solution. They placed mango and apple slices on the screens and then compared two room-temperature drying methods: one with the chamber at standard air pressure and the other under a slight vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/figcaption&gt;            &lt;/figure&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After four days under standard air pressure, the calcium chloride solutions drew out and adsorbed less moisture from the fruits than those placed under vacuum. The fruit slices at standard air pressure also dried inconsistently. Slices on the top screen contained 50–70% water (by weight) and those on the bottom had 20–30% water after the dehydration process.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the vacuum-assisted method produced consistently dried mango and apple pieces made up of about 30% moisture, which is similar to the amount in commercially available dried fruit, and represented a removal of approximately 95% of the initial water mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vacuum-dried mango pieces kept the raw fruit's attractive bright yellow color; however, the two dehydration methods darkened the apples by similar amounts. In addition, scanning electron microscopy images showed the breakdown of starch granules in all the samples, but more of them broke down under standard pressure, suggesting that the vacuum-assisted method slows down deterioration mechanisms and retains freshness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water pulled out of the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/fruit/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;fruit&lt;/a&gt; could potentially be reused. Bastarrachea says that "the collected water in the calcium chloride solution can be removed by evaporation, and the reconcentrated calcium &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/chloride/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chloride&lt;/a&gt; solution can be reutilized in more dehydration cycles."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the recovered water could be used in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/industrial+applications/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;industrial applications&lt;/a&gt; or further treated for human consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

With 24/7 access to news feeds, emails and social media, many of us find ourselves scrolling endlessly, chasing our next hit of dopamine. But these habits are fuelling our stress – and our brains are begging for a break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What our brains really need is some much needed time off from concentrating. By not consciously focusing on anything and allowing the mind to drift, this can reduce stress and improve cognitive sharpness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can often be easier said than done. But attention restoration theory (Art) can help you learn to give your brain space to drift. While this might sound like a fancy name for doing nothing, the theory is supported by neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attention restoration theory was first put forward by psychologists &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1989-98477-000"&gt;Rachel and Stephen Kaplan&lt;/a&gt; in 1989. They theorised that spending time in nature can help to restore focus and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They proposed there are two distinct types of attention: directed attention and undirected attention. Directed attention refers to deliberate concentration – such as studying, navigating through a busy place or posting on social media. Basically, it’s any activity where our brain’s attention is being directed at a specific task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Undirected attention is when we’re not consciously trying to focus on anything – instead allowing things to gently capture our attention without trying. Think listening to chirping birds or watching leaves gently rustling in the breeze. In these instances, your attention naturally drifts without having to force your focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without time for undirected attention, it’s thought that we experience &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-4944(95)90001-2"&gt;“attentional fatigue”&lt;/a&gt;. This can make it increasingly difficult to focus and concentrate, while distractions become more likely to grab our attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, we encountered many situations in our daily lives that we might classify as “boring”. Moments such as waiting for the bus or standing in the supermarket queue. But these dull moments also gave our minds a chance to switch off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, our smartphones give us the opportunity for constant entertainment. Being able to constantly expose ourselves to intense, gripping stimuli offers &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0013916518774400"&gt;little mental space&lt;/a&gt; for our overworked brains to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But attention restoration theory shows us how important it is to create space for moments that allow our brains to “reset”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Restoring attention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The origins of Kaplan and Kaplan’s theory can actually be traced back to the 19th century. American psychologist William James was the first to formulate the concept of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0272494495900012?via%3Dihub"&gt;“voluntary attention”&lt;/a&gt; – attention that requires effort. James’ ideas were published against the backdrop of the broader cultural movement of Romanticism, which &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1016/0191-6599%2890%2990175-E"&gt;lauded nature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romantic ideas about the restorative power of nature have since been backed by research – with numerous studies showing links between time in nature and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2020.126932"&gt;lower stress levels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02057/full"&gt;better attention&lt;/a&gt;, improvements in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11136-019-02125-9"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;, mood and &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-021-09631-8"&gt;better cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The restorative benefits of nature are backed by neuroscience, too. Neuroimaging has shown that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-022-01720-6"&gt;activity in the amygdala&lt;/a&gt; – the part of the brain associated with stress and anxiety – was reduced when people were exposed to natural environments. But when exposed to urban environments, this activity was not reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies have also since backed up Kaplan and Kaplan’s theory that time in nature can help to restore attention and wellbeing. One &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10937404.2018.1505571"&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; of 42 studies found an association with exposure to natural environments and improvements in several aspects of cognitive performance – including attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial"&gt;randomised controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; using neuroimaging of the brain found signs of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-78508-x"&gt;lower stress levels&lt;/a&gt; in adults who took a 40-minute walk in a natural environment, compared to participants who walked in an urban environment. The authors concluded that the nature walk facilitated attention restoration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has even shown that as little as ten minutes of undirected attention can result in a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0013916519882775"&gt;measurable uptick&lt;/a&gt; in performance on cognitive tests, as well as a reduction in attentional fatigue. Even simply walking on a treadmill while looking at a nature scene can produce this cognitive effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Time in nature&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways you can put attention restoration theory to the test on your own. First, find any kind of green space – whether that’s your local park, a river you can sit beside or a forest trail you can hike along. Next, make sure you put your phone and any other distractions away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, when you face boring moments during your day, instead of picking up your phone try seeing the pause as an opportunity to let your mind wander for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of us may find certain environments to be more naturally supportive in allowing us to switch off and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-4944(95)90001-2"&gt;disengage the mind&lt;/a&gt;. So if while trying to put attention restoration theory into practice you find your brain pulling you back to structured tasks (such as mentally planning your week), this may be sign you should go someplace where it’s easier for your mind to wander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re watching a ladybird crawl across your desk or visiting a vast expanse of nature, allow your attention to be undirected. It’s not laziness, it’s neurological maintenance.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259854/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259854/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

&lt;p&gt;A study in Israel confirms antibiotic use as a major risk factor for &lt;em&gt;Clostridioides difficile&lt;/em&gt; infection (CDI) in hospital patients, particularly for those who don't carry the bacterium, researchers reported last week in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2837369"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which was conducted from June 2017 through June 2023, researchers analyzed data on patients admitted to a large tertiary medical center in Israel that routinely screens high-risk patients for &lt;em&gt;C difficile&lt;/em&gt; carriage. While broad-spectrum antibiotic use is a known risk factor for CDI, the researchers wanted to evaluate the rate of hospital-onset CDI among asymptomatic &lt;em&gt;C difficile&lt;/em&gt; carriers compared with noncarriers and assess the role of antibiotic exposure in shaping CDI risk in the two populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Antibiotic exposure linked to double the risk of CDI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 33,756 hospitalizations (median age, 78 years; 52.8% male), 1,624 (4.8%) had a positive screening result for &lt;em&gt;C difficile&lt;/em&gt;. Overall, CDI occurred in 67 (4.1%) of 1,624 carriers and 47 (0.1%) of 32,132 noncarriers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the entire cohort, exposure to any antibiotic was associated with double the risk for CDI (hazard ratio [HR], 1.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24 to 3.16), with each additional day of antibiotic exposure having an HR of 1.08 (95% CI, 1.03 to 1.13). Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations were associated with significantly increased risk, with piperacillin-tazobactam showing the most pronounced hazard for CDI (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.41 to 3.36).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although a positive &lt;em&gt;C difficile&lt;/em&gt; screening result at admission was associated with a high risk of CDI (HR, 27.5; 95% CI, 18.7 to 40.3), antibiotic exposure among asymptomatic &lt;em&gt;C difficile&lt;/em&gt; carriers was not significantly associated with a further increase in CDI risk (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.58).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors say the findings suggest that, while antibiotic stewardship may reduce CDI risk in noncarriers, additional strategies may be needed for asymptomatic carriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Among carriers, preventive measures in addition to antibiotic stewardship should be evaluated in hospitalized patients and may include probiotics, monoclonal antibodies, or biotherapies," they wrote. "However, further research is necessary to evaluate the potential effectiveness of these interventions, their association with microbiome alterations, and potential changes in antimicrobial resistance patterns among patients and within the hospital environment."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are microscopic substances that take thousands of years to break down in the environment and human body, earning them the name 'forever chemicals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their main purpose is to repel water and oil, which is what makes non-stick cookware easier to clean and why certain jackets and tents can withstand rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The chemicals can seep into the water supply from washing dishes and can enter food if packaging is made to be grease-resistant or if the non-stick coating on pots and pans begins to deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS are also common in pesticides used on crops, which produces chemical-rich runoff that can enter the drinking water supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From an analysis of peer-reviewed scientific papers as well as interviews with researchers, non-profit leaders, entrepreneurs and investors, the researchers found the food and agricultural industries to be the worst offenders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They explain: 'Pesticides and fertilizers can pollute water and affect local ecosystems as well as the food we eat, and one of the most dangerous fertilizers is the sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants which is spread on fields even though it often contains many toxic chemicals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers warn that PFAS have now 'contaminated the whole world', with levels in rainwater often exceeding safe limits for drinking water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, the EPA set the maximum contaminant levels for PFAS at 4.0 parts per trillion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;PFAS exposure can contribute to diabetes development through several mechanisms, including disrupting cells in the pancreas responsible for regulating blood glucose levels, increasing insulin resistance, and potentially increasing body fat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Microplastics smaller than one micrometer, known as nanoplastics, are of most concern as research has shown they can infiltrate cells &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They note that despite the current level of evidence, there are still 'noticeable gaps' in how industry and regulatory bodies address chemical toxicity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, they highlight how loopholes in regulation have allowed more than 200 new food additives into the food system without undergoing pre-market approval. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One report by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) reveals that the number is closer to 900 and these additives get through the system through what is referred to as the 'generally recognized as safe,' or GRAS, loophole. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The loophole lets those companies – not the FDA – decide when a substance is safe,' the expose notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It adds: 'For the other 863 new food chemicals added to the food supply since 2000, food chemical companies exploited the GRAS loophole so they could make their own safety determinations.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Deep Science Ventures report reveals that in the FDA's own database, almost 80 percent of chemical additives directly added to food 'lack the relevant information needed to estimate the amount that consumers can safely eat, and 93 percent lack reproductive or developmental toxicity data.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And of the FDA-regulated additives - both directly and indirectly allowed in food - almost two-thirds don't have publicly available data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the EU, even with a 'precautionary ethos, typically based on the 'no hazard data, no market' principle', they say there are still too many exceptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The majority of commonly used chemicals lack adequate public data for their long-term health and environmental impacts,' they add. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While humans can't see chemicals and microplastics with the naked eye, research is increasingly showing they have a big impact on our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;PFAS is a common contaminant in many household items from cookware to toilet paper&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These toxins are estimated to cost the US healthcare system about $290 million per year, as they have been linked to everything from birth defects to cancer, dementia to asthma, and infertility to children's behavioral and learning difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microplastics smaller than one micrometer, known as nanoplastics, are of most concern, as research has shown they can infiltrate cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have revealed that microplastics can cause DNA damage and changes in gene activity, known for triggering cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Off the backs of the findings, the researchers called for policy makers and industry leaders to take immediate action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Underscoring the need for immediate action, the researchers concluded: 'Based on our findings, failure to act decisively will likely lead to irreversible consequences for both human health and the delicate balance of our planet's ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Policymakers should consider the impact of toxicity on fertility especially as many countries are struggling to boost it using expensive other incentives.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;PFAS exposure can contribute to diabetes development through several mechanisms, including disrupting cells in the pancreas responsible for regulating blood glucose levels, increasing insulin resistance, and potentially increasing body fat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Microplastics smaller than one micrometer, known as nanoplastics, are of most concern as research has shown they can infiltrate cells &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They note that despite the current level of evidence, there are still 'noticeable gaps' in how industry and regulatory bodies address chemical toxicity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, they highlight how loopholes in regulation have allowed more than 200 new food additives into the food system without undergoing pre-market approval. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One report by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) reveals that the number is closer to 900 and these additives get through the system through what is referred to as the 'generally recognized as safe,' or GRAS, loophole. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The loophole lets those companies – not the FDA – decide when a substance is safe,' the expose notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It adds: 'For the other 863 new food chemicals added to the food supply since 2000, food chemical companies exploited the GRAS loophole so they could make their own safety determinations.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Deep Science Ventures report reveals that in the FDA's own database, almost 80 percent of chemical additives directly added to food 'lack the relevant information needed to estimate the amount that consumers can safely eat, and 93 percent lack reproductive or developmental toxicity data.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And of the FDA-regulated additives - both directly and indirectly allowed in food - almost two-thirds don't have publicly available data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the EU, even with a 'precautionary ethos, typically based on the 'no hazard data, no market' principle', they say there are still too many exceptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The majority of commonly used chemicals lack adequate public data for their long-term health and environmental impacts,' they add. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While humans can't see chemicals and microplastics with the naked eye, research is increasingly showing they have a big impact on our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;PFAS is a common contaminant in many household items from cookware to toilet paper&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These toxins are estimated to cost the US healthcare system about $290 million per year, as they have been linked to everything from birth defects to cancer, dementia to asthma, and infertility to children's behavioral and learning difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microplastics smaller than one micrometer, known as nanoplastics, are of most concern, as research has shown they can infiltrate cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have revealed that microplastics can cause DNA damage and changes in gene activity, known for triggering cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Off the backs of the findings, the researchers called for policy makers and industry leaders to take immediate action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Underscoring the need for immediate action, the researchers concluded: 'Based on our findings, failure to act decisively will likely lead to irreversible consequences for both human health and the delicate balance of our planet's ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Policymakers should consider the impact of toxicity on fertility especially as many countries are struggling to boost it using expensive other incentives. This is important because human and planetary health is at stake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For us to ensure our continued development and ability to thrive as a human species, we have to accelerate the growth of innovative, technological solutions and ensure these are funded and scaled at pace.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 19:56:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOd0ZnUjMzbVBJRkNqUFl0Y3ZEd1BKaEt1ZU9uZWJ2RzZ3bVREd29DdVBnVnVFRUt1NFMtVWVkaG1ldlVocWdNbE5PWHFHWHhNQXFMU0dPbmdvaWd2WHV1VzhNSVlmQ2tjM0ltTDFQSlN4Si1KUmtGb21IUUZoZlpVbEQ5b2VVRDBqMG51SVBiNUF4Z2NRTUdvQjB1ZE9xekJPdU9WeHdMa9IBrAFBVV95cUxNXzNwOVJlUGxOWExaZl9nV2pjY0drRHI0SVNTSVdxUGFObEd6aFVic2hPSGRRU2RPZ1FaS0VFVnczQnYzbWVEaTZCallOc0hUWUtKeEpfdnZQd2d0Ym5uOUh5eVVXdXZxNkxNV3RXOC04a3J6czN6MUdtai1sRUVycnpXZlZYckRXd2ZPZ0FzTlpXYXVQamhpXzh0UWgzaW13SUFWZS1qU0ZkRVVn</guid></item><item><title>男子在食用香肠和西兰花三明治后因大规模爆发而死亡- LADbible</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxOZUM0RmQwZXdla3NjRmtuZF9LdmtTODdLQUVYT0x1SXAwTnVjRGltVHVDdG5LZFBhS3plYV8yUi1MXzNZejFfTEtMdWgyR2FBb19xZVByaGZMRkhLWXo2MHZ5a0lHdGdXS1hSdTlPQUJDTkZjMDlNTGhDTWxyb2t2UXFDZUVkRGVVdzFlcUZ0Qm0xdThYcEUwd0FyUElXRjk5YUhKS19DM1JZd2tJY0dxTktfS3VLUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A man in southern Italy has died after eating a contaminated sausage and broccoli sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Artist Luigi Di Sarno, 52, reportedly collapsed after allegedly eating the dish from a &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/food-and-drink"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;

like heroin that have been contaminated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Infant botulism&lt;/strong&gt; – when a baby swallows a tiny germ spore from things like dirty soil or honey.

														&lt;p&gt;Marijuana users have “superior performance across multiple cognitive domains,” according to a new large-scale study funded by the U.S. federal government, with the effects of cannabis on cognition “presented concurrently across a range of brain systems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research, published this month as a preprint by Nature Portfolio, analyzed brain imaging and cognitive data from 37,929 participants in the United Kingdom aged between 44 and 81 years old. The team found that cannabis consumers consistently outperformed non-users on a range of cognitive tests—suggesting that marijuana use may be linked to brain network patterns typically observed in younger individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that cannabis use may be associated with a deceleration of neural aging processes and the preservation of cognitive function in older adults,” the paper says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We speculate that cannabinoids and endocannabinoids may exert neuroprotective effects during aging by preserving an optimal balance between functional segregation and integration—an essential feature for maintaining specialized processing and efficient information transfer across brain networks,” wrote the researchers, who are from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Emory University, Georgia State University, University of Colorado, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Tri-Institutional Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors of the &lt;a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6977015/v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which was supported by National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health grants, noted that as marijuana laws evolve and societal attitudes shift, researchers are uncovering a more complex picture of the drug’s effects, particularly among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legalization, increased permissiveness, and recognition of therapeutic potential have contributed to a marked rise in marijuana consumption among the study population, the authors said. They pointed out that older adults now represent the fastest-growing group of cannabis users, increasingly using it to manage chronic physical and mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis users exhibited superior performance across multiple cognitive domains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain undergoes significant physiological changes with age, and the study underscored the importance of understanding how cannabis interacts with these processes.  The researchers cautioned, however, that “the effects of marijuana in older adults may differ significantly from those observed in younger populations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address gaps in previous research around marijuana’s effects on aging, the research team utilized advanced neuroimaging techniques on a vast dataset, which included brain scans and cognitive assessments from tens of thousands of participants in the UK Biobank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data revealed that cannabis users demonstrated brain network “characteristics typically associated with younger brains, along with enhanced cognitive abilities, highlighting a potential modulatory role for cannabinoids and endocannabinoids in neurodegenerative processes,” potentially supporting cognitive resilience. These benefits were noted from midlife into the late 60s and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cannabis use may confer neurocognitive benefits in older adults by modulating the organization of functional brain networks,” they speculated. “The observed effects imply that cannabinoids may exert neuroprotective influences in aging populations, potentially through their regulatory roles in maintaining or enhancing functional brain segregation and integration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s large scale has the potential to make it a landmark contribution to the field of marijuana and aging research, though the team emphasized that more research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms at play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, a study published last year found that marijuana use is associated with lower odds of subjective cognitive decline (SCD), with people who consume cannabis for recreational or medical purposes &lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-consumers-have-significantly-decreased-odds-of-cognitive-decline-study-finds/"&gt;reporting less confusion and memory loss compared to non-users&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate study in 2023 examining marijuana’s neurocognitive effects found that “&lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/study-finds-no-evidence-that-medical-marijuana-causes-cognitive-impairment-in-patients-with-chronic-health-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;prescribed medical cannabis may have minimal acute impact on cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; among patients with chronic health conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the long-term effects of cannabis use are far from settled science, findings from a number of recent studies suggest some fears have been overblown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report published in April that drew on dispensary data, for instance, found that &lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-helps-cancer-patients-think-more-clearly-and-manage-pain-study-using-cannabis-from-dispensaries-finds/" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false"&gt;cancer patients reported being able to think more clearly when using medical marijuana&lt;/a&gt;. They also said it helped manage pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate study of teens and young adults at risk of developing psychotic disorders found that regular &lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/young-people-at-risk-of-psychosis-saw-symptoms-surprisingly-improve-with-marijuana-use-study-finds/" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false"&gt;marijuana use over a two-year period did not trigger early onset of psychosis symptoms&lt;/a&gt;—contrary to the claims of prohibitionists who argue that cannabis causes mental illness. In fact, it was associated with modest improvements in cognitive functioning and reduced use of other medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another study published by the American Medical Association (AMA) last year that looked at data from more than 63 million health insurance beneficiaries determined that &lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-legalization-not-associated-with-increased-rates-of-psychosis-american-medical-association-study-of-63-million-people-finds/" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false"&gt;there’s “no statistically significant increase” in psychosis-related diagnoses&lt;/a&gt; in states that have legalized marijuana compared to those that continue to criminalize cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies from 2018, meanwhile, found that &lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/smoking-marijuana-actually-improves-working-memory-study-indicates/" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false"&gt;marijuana may actually increase working memory&lt;/a&gt; and that cannabis use &lt;a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/marijuana-use-doesnt-actually-change-the-structure-of-your-brain-new-study-finds/" rel="noopener" data-google-interstitial="false"&gt;doesn’t actually change the structure of the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But inch by inch, testing, failing and trying again, they make progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr, during Senate confirmation &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/hearingto-consider-the-nomination-of-robert-f-kennedy-jr-of-california-to-be-secretary-of-health-and-human-services" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;hearings&lt;/a&gt; for the role of secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), seemed to get that. Those who feared what a vaccine sceptic might do in that role breathed again. “I’m going to empower the scientists at HHS to do their job and make sure that we have good science that is evidence based … I’m not going to substitute my judgment for science,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"commentisfree","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","type":"Blog","title":"Opinion"},{"id":"society/vaccines","type":"Keyword","title":"Vaccines and immunisation"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"Keyword","title":"US news"},{"id":"world/coronavirus-outbreak","type":"Keyword","title":"Coronavirus"},{"id":"us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr","type":"Keyword","title":"Robert F Kennedy Jr"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"business/pharmaceuticals-industry","type":"Keyword","title":"Pharmaceuticals industry"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"science/infectiousdiseases","type":"Keyword","title":"Infectious diseases"},{"id":"science/medical-research","type":"Keyword","title":"Medical research"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/editorials","type":"Tone","title":"Editorials"},{"id":"tone/comment","type":"Tone","title":"Comment"},{"id":"profile/editorial","type":"Contributor","title":"Editorial"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/journal","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Journal"},{"id":"theguardian/journal/opinion","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Opinion"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-letters-and-leader-writers","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Letters and Leader Writers"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"commentisfree/2025/aug/11/the-guardian-view-on-rfk-jrs-vaccine-cuts-an-assault-on-science-from-a-politician-unfit-for-his-office","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet now, without good explanation or sound science, he is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/05/rfk-jr-hhs-mrna-vaccine-research" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cutting&lt;/a&gt; $500m of research funding for mRNA vaccines, claiming that they “fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like Covid and flu”. In fact, no Covid vaccine fully protects against infection, but they have been shown to prevent deaths in billions of people. The 22 contracts that will be cancelled include one with Moderna for a vaccine against bird flu, which many &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/Could-Bird-Flu-Be-the-Next-Global-Pandemic.aspx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt; could trigger the next human pandemic (and there will be one). Instead, federal funds will go to vaccines developed in more traditional ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Either Mr Kennedy lied to Congress or he has a different understanding of science and evidence from most scientists, unpicking what they thought was uncontestable. The childhood vaccine schedule is being reconsidered, and &lt;a href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/health/rfk-measles-vaccines-are-important-but-government-mandates-are-not-the-answer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;mandating&lt;/a&gt; the measles vaccine is being questioned in spite of fatal outbreaks in the US. He has sacked the Centers for Disease Control vaccine advisory panel and replaced it with many people known to have sceptical views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Mr Kennedy is particularly hostile to the mRNA vaccines against Covid-19, &lt;a href="https://publichealthcollaborative.org/alerts/false-claims-that-covid-19-vaccines-are-the-most-deadly-vaccines-in-history/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;panning&lt;/a&gt; them in 2021 as the “deadliest vaccines in history”, wrongly claiming that half those suffering the rare side-effect of myocarditis would die or need heart transplants within five years. The vast majority have quickly recovered. Until 2023, he chaired an anti-vaccine organisation called Children’s Health Defense, where he petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to rescind the licence of all Covid-19 vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/2022-01-24/ty-article/.premium/robert-f-kennedy-jr-says-vaccine-mandates-harder-to-escape-than-nazi-persecution/0000017f-dc44-d3a5-af7f-feee56c50000" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;compared&lt;/a&gt; mandating vaccines to Nazi oppression in the second world war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This is the stuff of internet scares; labyrinthine tangles of misinformation dotted with odd inaccurate nuggets of quasi-science. It doesn’t compare with the evidence base for mRNA vaccines, which went through clinical trials on hundreds of thousands of people and have since been used to vaccinate billions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts agree that the mRNA vaccines were a stunning breakthrough that allowed people to be protected in record time from Covid-19. They contain messenger RNA, a tiny bit of genetic code that teaches the immune system to fight the virus. No need to grow the virus in hen’s eggs, which takes months. The “plug and play” technology can be adapted against other viruses, such as flu, including some that devastate populations in poor countries. The inventors &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/oct/02/scientists-whose-work-enabled-mrna-covid-vaccine-win-nobel-prize-for-medicine-katalin-kariko-drew-weissman" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;won the Nobel prize in 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Mr Kennedy’s cancellation of funding not only stymies much research but also feeds worldwide doubt in mRNA vaccines. We are all the losers. Humanity needs these vaccines. Other countries need to step up with money and reassurance to try to heal this latest breach between science and nonsense. And Mr Kennedy is clearly unfit for the job he holds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 18:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7AFBVV95cUxQV2EzODIxSEl5OWtyRmozdlRqQnZZNG5adk8yc1c2Rkh0TDd0eVF0U2VfTG9GTFdRTzZDU0hsbGE3ZXBiQ2tIcWhkWXBadFcwRm9ZVU8wTFBabWswVU1TcHFOX2VvZmdMV3Z5SVpvR3MxOUpFR2xqaVdRT2ZxTUo5RlAtakJPaDl1bUU3M05VUGVwQS1Uc055WmJ1c0dkRmRmZ3NMWGxWMTdJQ0R1Y0hGa1VlWk5JNVZuc3p0a2haQmVHQ2xtR1BDODNyRklYanM1MjlxUzdHYmkwUUc0LWN6OU5xMWdmVVQxTjRuSg</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，在海螺壳中吹气有助于治疗睡眠呼吸暂停患者的危险打鼾症状-好消息网络</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQU1p0OURkWmh6THRMUlZBak9CTXFheXJuVXdjdTVlZU9GYlNPSnNQbVdCR2NMeTZNRWZ5Uy0wS1J3a3RUZDY5NWhoUXlfZnJOanBYdWd6R3pONUFVa3Q5bHY2bC10ak04bUlQOVk4dWVnY3FKT0Y4R2l1Zk85am9WQUtyV2lxaV9XUERtZmMwTGNaV1pPOEJ4ZDFoRzFXVWJGeVVxSlpNTzFQUkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blowing through a conch shell could help treat a potentially deadly snoring condition, according to new research from India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who took part in the ancient practice regularly for six months experienced a significant reduction in their symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common sleep disorder where breathing stops repeatedly during the night due to a blocked airway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It leads to loud snoring, restless sleep, and daytime sleepiness, and can increase the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blowing the conch shell, called shankh blowing, has been part of Indian culture for thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study, &lt;a href="https://publications.ersnet.org/content/erjor/early/2025/06/05/2312054100258-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published in the&lt;/a&gt; European Respiratory Society’s ERJ Open Research, showed that people with moderate OSA who practiced shankh blowing slept better and felt more alert during the day, but most importantly had fewer breathing interruptions at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team determined that conch blowing— a traditional yogic breathing exercise where you exhale sharply through a conch shell—could reduce the need for medication or machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the standard treatment for OSA is a ‘continuous positive airway pressure machine’, or CPAP, which keeps the patient’s airway open by blowing air through a face mask throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While effective, many patients find it uncomfortable and struggle to use it consistently,” said study leader Dr. Krishna K. Sharma, of the Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute in Jaipur, India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his clinical practice, several patients used the shankh-blowing method and reported feeling more rested and experiencing fewer symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These observations led us to design a scientific study to rigorously test whether this simple, ancient practice could serve as a meaningful therapy for people with OSA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved 30 participants with moderate OSA, aged between 19 and 65, who were assessed at the Research Institute between 2022 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were tested with polysomnography, meaning they were monitored throughout a night’s sleep. They were also asked questions about the quality of their sleep and how sleepy they feel during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were randomly assigned to either be trained to practice blowing through a conch shell or a deep breathing exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants in the first group were provided with a traditional shankh used in yoga, and were trained at the clinic before beginning home-based practice requiring a minimum of 15 minutes, five days per week. The patients were then reassessed after six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the people who practiced deep breathing, the people who practiced shankh blowing were 34% less sleepy during the daytime. They also reported sleeping better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4-5 Fewer Apneas Per Hour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polysomnographs revealed that they had on average four to five fewer apneas per hour—where breathing stops during sleep. They also had higher levels of oxygen in their blood during the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The way the shankh is blown is quite distinctive,” explained Dr. Sharma. “It involves a deep inhalation followed by a forceful, sustained exhalation through tightly pursed lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This action creates strong vibrations and airflow resistance, which likely strengthens the muscles of the upper airway, including the throat and soft palate – areas that often collapse during sleep in people with OSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The conch’s unique spiraling structure may also contribute to specific acoustic and mechanical effects that further stimulate and tone these muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people living with OSA, especially those who find the CPAP face masks uncomfortable, unaffordable, or inaccessible, the study offers a promising alternative that is simple and low-cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team noted that this is a small study, but they are now “planning a larger trial involving several hospitals”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This next phase will allow us to validate and expand on our findings in a broader, more diverse population and assess how shankh blowing performs over longer periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We also want to study how this practice affects airway muscle tone, oxygen levels and sleep in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re particularly interested in comparing shankh blowing with standard treatments like CPAP, and in examining its potential help in more severe forms of OSA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Sophia Schiza, head of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) group on sleep disordered breathing, who was not involved in the study, welcomed the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While CPAP and other treatments are available based on careful diagnosis of disease severity, there is still need for new treatments,” said the professor at the University of Crete, in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is an intriguing study that shows the ancient practice of shankh blowing could potentially offer an OSA treatment for selected patients by targeting muscles training. A larger study will help provide more evidence for this intervention which could be of benefit as a treatment option or in combination with other treatments in selected OSA patients.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;An online insomnia treatment developed at the University of Virginia is stepping in to help older people who struggle to fall asleep and stay asleep, according to the treatment creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Older adults do have a more difficult time with insomnia,” said Lee Ritterband, PhD., the director of UVA Health’s Center for Behavioral Health and Technology. “They tend to have a difficult time with falling asleep and waking in the middle of the night, having trouble falling back asleep, and also waking up early in the morning, before they’re wanting to get up.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ritterband is the creator of the SHUTi OASIS intervention, which stands for “Sleep Healthy Using the Internet for Older Adults Suffering with Insomnia and Sleeplessness.” He said it’s the first digital health program for insomnia, specifically for adults over the age of 55. One of the 311 participants in the trial was 95 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important aspects, according to Ritterband, is that older adults were generally able to do the internet-based program without technical support from others. Ritterband said the treatment would benefit many older people who might not have access to in-person treatment because of location or cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the user experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a web page, they can do it on their phone, they can do it on their computer,” said Ritterband. “It’s text, it’s pictures, it’s videos, it’s interactions they can interact with by clicking and dragging and dropping and moving things around.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ritterband said researchers expected older users to have more difficulty navigating the treatment: “Almost nobody needed support, we were blown away with how well people were able to do it on their own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does SHUTi work, help?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ritterband said the SHUTi (pronounced “shut eye”) treatment is based on cognitive behavioral therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a person is struggling to fall asleep, “They’re having some thoughts that might be interfering — maybe they’re feeling anxious, maybe their mind is racing — those are the cognitive components,” said Ritterband.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program teaches users to manage those intrusive thoughts, “and how to think about things, maybe a little bit differently,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the behavioral side, Ritterband said the program integrates information the users supply in sleep diaries, “and that’s taking that data and creating a very tailored program for that particular person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ritterband said the algorithm helps a user determine what time they should go to sleep and what time they should wake up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, it provides stimulus control guidelines — a set of rules that patients are encouraged to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things like don’t go to bed if you’re not sleepy, don’t stay in bed for more than twenty minutes awake,” said Ritterband. “And, if you are, get out of bed, do some quiet activity, and only go back into bed when you’re feeling sleepy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study published in the scientific journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01847-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;npj Digital Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, participants either used the SHUTi OASIS program by themselves, with technical assistance, or received standard online information about insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study, the online program significantly outperformed the standard materials at the end of the trial, six months later, and again a year after the trial ended, based upon participants’ descriptions of their ability to sleep and by clinical indicators of insomnia and remission.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Anxiety management and life satisfaction sit within psychological well-being in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/positive+psychology/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;positive psychology&lt;/a&gt;. Previous studies have examined anxiety control with limited age ranges and without incorporating research proliferating since 2019, and no &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/meta-analysis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; specifically evaluated life satisfaction as an outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "The Role of Laughter Therapy in Adults: Life Satisfaction and Anxiety Control. A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis," &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10902-025-00934-z" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Happiness Studies&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/systematic+review/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; of randomized controlled trials with random-effects meta-analyses to understand the effect of laughter therapy on life satisfaction and anxiety management in adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty-three randomized &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; from 1991 to 2024 included 2,159 adult participants (~74% women) across health-care and non-health-care social settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results from each trial were converted into standardized mean differences (SMD), a measure that expresses the size of the effect in units of standard deviation. An SMD of 0.2 is considered small, 0.5 moderate, and 0.8 or higher large. This approach allows results from different life satisfaction or anxiety scales to be compared on the same metric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta-analysis models revealed significant large results for anxiety management (SMD = -0.83) and increased life satisfaction (SMD = 0.98).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subgroup analyses reported laughter yoga effects for anxiety as SMD = -1.02 (large) and life satisfaction of SMD = 1.28 (large). High heterogeneity appeared in several models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control group contrasts were used to compare effects on anxiety vs. no intervention SMD = -1.02 (large) vs. usual care SMD = -0.51 (moderate). And for life satisfaction, no intervention SMD = 1.53 (large) vs. usual care SMD = 0.19 (small).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online laughter therapy shows negligible anxiety effects (SMD = -0.03), possibly suggesting there is a more active social interaction component involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude that laughter therapy could be beneficial in reducing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/anxiety/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt; levels and improving &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/life+satisfaction/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;life satisfaction&lt;/a&gt;. They recommend continued randomized controlled trials to strengthen the evidence and promote these types of therapies more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

That's why knowing when and how to weigh yourself can make a big difference. If you are using the scale as one of your tracking tools to track how much muscle you've gained and how you feel overall, you should stick to a particular time to weigh yourself at home every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;It's a question that comes up often in &lt;a target="_self" data-id="6a2e43d8-d663-4c68-82d5-040658e07558" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1cm88n5/what_time_of_day_for_weighing_is_most_accurate/"&gt;Reddit's r/WeightLossAdvice&lt;/a&gt; community, and for good reason. Small changes in timing and consistency can completely shift the way you see your results. If you're looking for a smarter way to track your weight, this simple trick can help you get more accurate and less frustrating readings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily fluctuations caused by &lt;a data-id="fb2a0c92-ff3f-4600-85c7-ec32867b58ac" href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-meal-kit-delivery-service/" target="_self"&gt;meals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-id="fb2a0c92-ff3f-4600-85c7-ec32867b58ac" href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/these-hydration-hacks-will-make-you-forget-you-ever-hated-water/" target="_self"&gt;water intake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-id="fb2a0c92-ff3f-4600-85c7-ec32867b58ac" href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/7-ways-to-sneak-more-exercise-into-your-daily-routine-without-it-feeling-miserable/" target="_self"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; are normal, so timing and consistency are key.

This might be something like eating a large meal or drinking a large amount of liquid, which can in turn cause you to "weigh more" temporarily. You may also want to avoid weighing yourself after exercise because you will weigh less due to the water lost through sweating, so time your weigh-in at a different time than &lt;a data-id="b6de5b02-4930-4906-9bb3-80689c9b449c" href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/find-the-best-time-of-day-to-exercise/" target="_self"&gt;your workout time&lt;/a&gt; for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you experience menstruation, you may want to avoid weighing yourself in the days leading up to your period.

His mother, Ruthi Clement, told the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; she found her son face-down in his bed, his skin purple. Two doses of Narcan didn’t work to revive her son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/health/demi-lovato-overdose-narcan/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Narcan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Narcan&lt;/a&gt; — the branded name for naloxone — is an emergency medication intended to reverse the effects of a narcotic overdose. But nitazenes are so potent that Narcan isn’t as effective as it is against a heroin overdose, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason for the influx of fentanyl, and now nitazenes, is that it’s easier to smuggle in smaller, but more potent drugs, U.K. National Crime Agency Deputy Director Charles Yates told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. “They buy potent nitazenes cheaply and mix them with bulking agents such as caffeine and paracetamol to strengthen the product being sold and make significant profits,” Yates told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crowder Funeral Home&lt;/p&gt; Lucci's mom is speaking out after her son died from a pill laced with nitazene.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it's commonly mixed into pills and powders, a man in Sydney was arrested on Aug. 5 for selling vapes that were "supercharged" with the drug, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/06/sydney-vapes-nitazene-synthetic-opioid-ntwnfb" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Guardian;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports.

&lt;p&gt;The agency’s director, Jay Bhattacharya, made the statement during an appearance on right-wing provocateur Steve Bannon’s podcast, “War Room,” that &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-4696-the-mainstreams-destruction-of-public-health/id1485351658?i=1000721307609" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;aired on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;. His rationale for the cancellation of the contracts does not align with the explanation offered last week by his boss, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/05/mrna-vaccine-development-canceled-by-kennedy-hhs/"&gt;said vaccines made using this platform were not effective and were unsafe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NIH director, who came to national prominence during the pandemic as a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration — a policy statement urging the U.S. government to lift Covid containment measures — said the declining uptake of Covid boosters signals that the public isn’t willing to be immunized with mRNA-based vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As far as public health goes, the mRNA platform for vaccines is no longer viable,” Bhattacharya said. “You can’t have a platform where such a large fraction of the population distrusts the platform, if you’re going to use it for vaccines, and expect it to work.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has been among the most prominent figures in the U.S. voicing distrust of the vaccines, long before he became the U.S. secretary of health and human services.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, called Bhattacharya’s comment “disingenuous.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and his allies have argued — despite scientific evidence — that the vaccines are not safe and effective, and “that message that they’re selling is one of the major reasons why there is potential public reluctance,” Osterholm told STAT. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharya confirmed it was Kennedy’s decision to terminate the contracts that had been issued by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.  BARDA is the HHS division responsible for developing medical countermeasures for natural and bioterror threats. In May, BARDA also &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/28/moderna-flu-vaccine-development-cancelled-by-hhs-mrna-platform-offers-speedy-pandemic-response/"&gt;rescinded $766 million in grants&lt;/a&gt; to Moderna for work the vaccine manufacturer was doing to develop, test, and bring through licensure several vaccines for flu viruses that could trigger pandemics.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the Bannon podcast, Bhattacharya said that, in his view, the mRNA vaccine platform is “promising but not yet ready for prime time for vaccines.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Billions of people around the world have been vaccinated with mRNA-based vaccines since the first two vaccines for Covid — Cominarty, made by the Pfizer and BioNTech partnership, and Spikevax, made by Moderna — went into use in December 2020. Other vaccines made using different production approaches eventually came to market. But a substantial portion of Covid vaccine doses administered in the intervening years were made using mRNA and widely credited with saving millions of lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharya reiterated a concern sometimes espoused by critics of mRNA vaccines that relates to the fact that the shots trigger the body to produce the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, thereby training the immune system to recognize it and produce antibodies to attack the virus in the case of infection. Critics of the vaccines argue it isn’t possible to know how much antigen — the protein the immune system is being introduced to — these vaccines generate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For vaccines, what you want is a technology where you understand the dose of the antigen being given,” he said. When “you have a platform like the mRNA platform, what you’re doing essentially [is] you’re turning your body into an antigen factor. You’re taking your cells, which are capable of taking the mRNA programming, and turn out an antigen that you want to be produced there.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Scott Hensley, a professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, said the concern Bhattacharya raised is also true in the case of another type of vaccine, those made using live but weakened viruses. Examples of live attenuated vaccines include the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, the rotavirus vaccine, and the chickenpox (varicella) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Studies have shown that the mRNA is destroyed shortly after vaccination,” said Hensley, who is working to develop a universal flu vaccine using mRNA technology. “It is difficult to quantify the amount of antigen produced by the vaccine, but this is an issue that has already been addressed in vaccinology.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Dr. Bhattacharya might not realize that a lot of human vaccines are based on live-attenuated viruses, where we similarly cannot definitively quantify antigen amounts produced in [recipients],” he said. “This is why we complete human clinical studies before vaccines are widely used in humans. The mRNA and live attenuated vaccine platforms have both proven to be safe and effective in clinical studies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bhattacharya also noted that Covid vaccines made using mRNA do not prevent infection; he said he contracted Covid for the first time two months after getting vaccinated. In fact, this is true about all Covid vaccines — none permanently block infection — and about vaccines that protect against influenza as well. The vaccines, which are made using a variety of production platforms, do, however,  lower the risk of severe infection that would lead to hospitalization or death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We would all love a vaccine that prevents infections altogether, but keeping people alive and out of the hospital during a pandemic is pretty darn good,” Hensley said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The prospect that mRNA technology could be improved is a rationale for further investment in research, not abandonment of this production method, he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We should try to improve the mRNA platform by investing in mRNA vaccine research. If we continue to invest in this platform, in 5-10 years we will likely be able to develop vaccines that elicit broader responses and better mucosal responses that prevent infections,” Hensley said in an email. “Now is the time to continue to develop this platform so that we can be ready to respond to the next pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;

Now she's forced to only use the drug as a 'last resort'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Emily Mendez (pictured), former psychotherapist in Indiana, said a steroid injection gave her symptoms of 'mania' within days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When taken at high doses or for extended periods, corticosteroids can interfere with the balance of certain brain chemicals, potentially leading to an increased likelihood of symptoms of depression, anxiety, mood swings, irritability or even mania or psychosis,' Dr Jeffrey Ditzell, lead psychiatrist at &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jeffditzellpsychiatry.com/"&gt;Dr Ditzell Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; in New York City, told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Corticosteroids reduce inflammation and pain throughout the body by mimicking the effects of cortisol, a 'stress hormone' released by the adrenal glands to regulate inflammation, by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also suppress the immune system, which triggers inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These are different from anabolic steroids - synthetic forms of testosterone often used as performance-enhancing drugs by athletes - and generally treat autoimmune conditions, allergic reactions and inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most commonly prescribed corticosteroid in the US is prednisone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As a pharmacist, I see these medications used for anything from a sore throat to a skin rash to asthma to an unknown condition that involves the immune system,' Dr Erika Gray, pharmacist and founder and chief medical officer at &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.toolboxgenomics.com/"&gt;ToolBox Genomics&lt;/a&gt;, told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Corticosteroids usually come as pills but can also be taken as injections, via ear and eye ingestion or as intravenous infusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prednisone in particular is thought to disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which coordinates the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and adrenal glands, all of which regulate the body's stress response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This dysregulation can send stress hormones like cortisol into overdrive, contributing to mood swings and symptoms of depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Long term corticosteroid use can also cause the memory section of our brain to decrease in size which can negatively affect our memory and mood,' Dr Gray said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A great way to think about the effect of corticosteroids on the brain is this medication makes your brain feel it is under constant stress.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The most commonly prescribed corticosteroid in the US is prednisone with about 18 million prescriptions per year (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mendez, a former psychotherapist and mental health author, was given an injection of the corticosteroid Kenalog, a brand name for triamcinolone, in 2023 for shoulder pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Within a day of getting this steroid injection, I started to experience hypomanic symptoms. I had been stable previously,' Mendez, who has bipolar disorder, told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I called my psychiatrist, who increased my medication dose for bipolar disorder. Despite this, I developed severe mania and was hospitalized shortly after. The onset of hypomania/mania coincided with the steroid injection.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors at the hospital told Mendez the steroid injection likely triggered the hypomania, a less severe form of mania that causes extreme mood and energy changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because of this, and the fact that I live with bipolar, steroids will be a last resort for me in the future,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A TikTok user, Amanda Powell, said prednisone made her feel like she was 'losing' her mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I saw therapist after psychiatrist over and over and over again and nothing was going right. They prescribed me depression and anxiety medication and it just made my mania worse,' she said in a recent video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The crazy thing is people never associate prednisone with mania.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another video posted earlier this year, Powell said, 'The side effects aren't worth the journey sometimes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ditzell said prednisone in particular is most commonly associated with depression, irritability and mania at high doses, while its counterpart dexamethasone may increase the risk of sleep disruptions along with mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also said oral corticosteroids are most likely to cause depression and other mood issues. These include prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained inhaled versions of the drugs have a 'lower risk of mood effects due to low systemic absorption' while topical creams have a 'very low risk of systemic mood side effects unless used over large areas for long periods'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Gray also said 'using topical hydrocortisone for long periods of time and over a large part of the body' could increase the risk of systemic absorption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ditzell believes the risk of depression is highest with bigger doses - over 40 milligrams per day - over longer periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hilary Hodge (pictured) told the Daily Mail while she is normally 'mellow', steroids make her moods drastically shift&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women and older patients may also be at a greater risk due to having more hormone fluctuations and general sensitivity to medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The risk of depression and mood changes can be managed and, in some cases, lowered or prevented with using the lowest effective dose of the medication for the shortest duration of time,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The use of local instead of systemic steroids when possible is recommended. For example, for asthma, allergies or eczema, inhaled, nasal or topical steroids are often safer than oral medications.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also suggests tapering the dose slowly, which means gradually decreasing it over time before stopping. This helps minimize any effects from sudden dosage changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Gray also advised against quitting cold turkey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Never stop corticosteroids medication suddenly or without your prescribers help. These medications need to be slowly decreased over time.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts urged those taking corticosteroids to keep a close eye on potential side effects and seek medical attention immediately if they notice drastic changes in mood.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While taking corticosteroids, it is important to take immediate action if you experience suicidal thoughts or urges, if you feel out of control, or experience intense agitation or paranoia. Call a crisis line, reach out to a mental health professional, or go to the ER,' Dr Ditzell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These symptoms are rare, but serious.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 17:11:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPd3lORm16d0NfMFEyMC1nUEVoUkwtZlZxYkI2bEpiOGczcjBmM1VlSElMaHRUUC1KRXZYeGg5Q29UdDlqalNPS3JQR0wyYUhZeWhGLUtpc0dtMHg1emF1Uk1DZlplZTd2eHVKOG80YUxwY091UF8xOE1PeUh4VFM4Y0ZvUTRfM2ZMZi12T0U3ekwzTk45cFVQWXZBdkMweW1yZVE</guid></item><item><title>在全国范围内召回了超过11,000瓶血压药物- SILive.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QL2XDJVVLNBBJBOZ25RL5Q5OOM"&gt;More than 11,000 bottles of a popular blood pressure medication distributed nationwide has been recalled, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2GS7KSUQSVARVIBVBRAP3JZGKE"&gt;The recall involves bottles of Spironolactone Tablets, USP, 25 mg, 100-count — manufactured by Frontida BioPharm, Inc., and distributed by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3VJLOC64MJBADF7JYSEPOO5ECY"&gt;The medication could contain the presence of foreign substance, identified as aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LUDTGSMTN5BGZF2OGULSNCN5XM"&gt;The medication under recall includes bottles with a lot number of P3314 and an expiration date of Nov. 30, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="P6OL5WSQPBDR7AOWVVWLIJQNCY"&gt;The bottles were distributed nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JKM2ECFDLFHDDJNFXJMQMDOBHU"&gt;The recall was initiated on Aug. 5, and was classified to a Class II risk level on Aug. 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="R6TU5BKHRNCHVDVGABJCOV2EUE"&gt;A Class II recall is a situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6BCMLHVXGBA6NBZO7UCZXN4IVI"&gt;The recall remains ongoing, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:YB7L4PD32JGGVP3USRMKFOHTDY" data-fusion-component="YB7L4PD32JGGVP3USRMKFOHTDY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:YB7L4PD32JGGVP3USRMKFOHTDY" data-fusion-component="YB7L4PD32JGGVP3USRMKFOHTDY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DJ2D4TPV6JGONPKPZJINZ43OZI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--center skimlinks"&gt;If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.&lt;span&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians say beans are the most underrated ingredient for weight loss. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beans are packed with protein and fiber to keep you full and satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They also help with weight loss by supporting gut health and managing blood sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; No one has to tell you that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893676/how-to-lose-weight-when-you-dont-know-where-to-start-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight loss can feel challenging&lt;/a&gt; for so many reasons.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While we wish there were a magic solution, dietitians agree that one of the best things you can do is to choose foods that have actually been shown to help with weight loss. Like beans. “Beans are the unsung heroes of weight management,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drewhemler/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Drew Hemler, M.Sc., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;. “They’re inexpensive, versatile and loaded with a trio of fiber, protein and slow-digesting carbs that keep you full longer while curbing cravings.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Read on to find out why beans are our MVP ingredient for weight loss, plus quick, tasty ways to add them to your favorite meals and snacks.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-beans-may-help-with-weight-loss"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Beans May Help with Weight Loss &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They’re Low in Calories, Yet Big on Volume  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Beans are relatively low in calories but high in volume, thanks to their fiber and water content,” says Hemler. “That means you can eat a satisfying portion that fills you up without overloading on calories, which is an ideal combo for anyone trying to lose or manage weight.” For instance, 1 cup of canned black beans contains just 220 calories. At the same time, they’re 75% water, which pumps up their volume.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even though beans are low in calories, they pack a slew of vitamins and minerals, making them nutritional superstars. &lt;a href="http://nutritionstarringyou.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, points out that beans, like black, kidney, white, garbanzo and pinto beans, also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290053/8-foods-with-more-potassium-than-a-banana/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;provide potassium&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrient that we need for healthy blood pressure, yet most of us fall short of. So, in addition to helping with weight loss, they also fill in an important nutrition gap.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They’re Packed with Protein and Fiber  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans contain a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-high-protein-high-fiber-meal-plan-for-weight-loss-11736989" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dynamic weight-loss duo of protein and fiber&lt;/a&gt;. “The protein, slowly digestible starches and soluble fiber in beans help slow gastric emptying and regulate blood sugar, and as a result, reduce hunger-driven cravings,” says Hemler. And when you feel full, you’re a lot less likely to mindlessly munch, which may help you eat fewer calories. Their combo of protein and fiber is so powerful that one study found that people who ate roughly 1 cup of beans per day had a lower body mass index and body weight and smaller waist size compared to people who didn’t usually eat beans.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While all beans differ slightly, 1 cup of canned black beans gives you a whopping 17 grams of fiber and 15 grams of protein.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regularly eating beans helps keep your gut bacteria in tip-top shape, which may translate to easier weight loss, says Harris-Pincus. That’s because beans are rich in a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-resistant-starch-11749332" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;hard-to-digest carbohydrate called resistant starch&lt;/a&gt;. After you eat, say, a bowl of bean chili, the resistant starch from the beans travels to your gut. When it gets there, your gut good bacteria gobble it up for food. As they do this, they produce helpful compounds, called short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), linked to lower body weight, a reduced risk of obesity and lower blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nearly one-third of U.S. adults are living with prediabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That doesn’t just increase the risk of diabetes, it’s also a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7899465/8-sneaky-reasons-you-could-be-gaining-weight-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sneaky cause of weight gain&lt;/a&gt;. Prediabetes often begins with a silent condition called insulin resistance, which can disrupt your ability to maintain a healthy weight. Trouble is, health care providers don’t usually test for insulin resistance. So, many of us have it without even knowing it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating beans might just help protect against insulin resistance and the weight gain that comes along with it. “The plant-based protein and fiber in beans can aid in blood sugar control as well as increasing satiety to help people lose or maintain weight,” says Harris-Pincus. “Beans also contain antioxidants, which clinical studies have shown may reduce insulin resistance, aiding weight management.” In addition to protein and fiber, beans contain antioxidant-rich substances called saponins, which have been shown to lower blood sugar and protect against insulin resistance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are incredibly versatile, working well in both sweet and savory dishes. And using canned beans can help you make mealtime magic happen in no time.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nutrition experts unanimously agree that weight loss doesn’t happen overnight. It’s really about the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-i-lost-110-pounds-8773037" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;small, sustainable changes&lt;/a&gt; that can add up over time. Like adding beans to your day. “Including beans, lentils and chickpeas regularly in the diet is associated with numerous health benefits, including healthy weight maintenance, gut health and risk reduction for several chronic diseases,” says Harris-Pincus. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are big in volume, yet low in calories and are loaded with filling fiber and protein. They may also support weight loss by keeping your gut bacteria happy and healthy and improving your body’s ability to use insulin. “Beans aren’t just good for your waistline; they’re great for your wallet, gut and the planet, too,” says Hemler. “Whether you’re going meatless or just adding more plants, beans bring big benefits in a small, humble package.” Plus, they’re incredibly versatile. Whether you like them in dips, tacos, chili, soup, enchiladas or even smoothies or dessert, there are loads of good reasons to pop open a can!

&lt;p&gt;The Ripley County Health Department, along with the Indiana Department of Health (IDOH), set mosquito traps this time of year and test the bugs for various things, including West Nile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health Officer Dr. David Welsh says there are no confirmed human cases of West Nile Virus in Ripley County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He adds there are steps you take to cut down on mosquitos and the risk of contracting West Nile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These include get rid of breeding grounds by eliminating standing water; using bug repellant spray when outside and using wearing long sleeve shirts, particularly in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The other thing is, if you get mosquito bites and your body does not respond you’d normally expect, you need to get it checked out,” Dr. Welsh said.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, replacing any form of potatoes with whole grains was associated with a lower type 2 diabetes risk, but swapping them for white rice was linked to an increased risk, the results show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potatoes contain several nutrients including fiber, vitamin C, and magnesium, but they also have a high starch content and therefore a high glycemic index, so have been linked to a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But neither the preparation method for potatoes nor specific foods that potatoes would replace have been considered, both of which are key to evaluating the overall health impact of potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this, researchers investigated the association between intake of potatoes prepared by different methods (boiled, baked, or mashed versus French fries) and risk of type 2 diabetes. They also looked at the impact on health of replacing potatoes with other major carbohydrates, such as whole grains and rice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings are based on more than 205,000 health professionals from three large US studies carried out between 1984 and 2021. Participants were free of diabetes, heart disease or cancer and completed detailed food questionnaires every four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During almost 40 years of follow up, 22,299 people were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for lifestyle and dietary factors related to diabetes risk, the researchers found that for every three weekly servings of total potato, the rate of type 2 diabetes increased by 5% and for every three weekly servings of French fries, the rate increased by 20%. However, similar intake of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes was not associated with a significantly increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replacing three weekly servings of total potato with whole grains lowered the type 2 diabetes rate by 8%. Substituting baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes with whole grains lowered the rate by 4%, and replacing French fries lowered the rate by 19%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, replacing total potatoes or baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes with white rice was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an observational study so no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect and the researchers can't rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors may have influenced their results. Most participants were also health professionals of European ancestry, so findings may not apply to other populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, they conclude: "Our findings underscore that the association between potato intake and type 2 diabetes risk depends on the specific foods used as replacement. The findings also align with current dietary recommendations that promote the inclusion of whole grains as part of a healthy diet for the prevention of type 2 diabetes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, are potatoes back on the plate? Well, it depends, say researchers in a linked editorial, who note that it is important to consider preparation method and replacement food when guiding the public or informing policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They point out that with their relatively low environmental impact and their health impact, baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes can be part of a healthy and sustainable diet, though whole grains should remain a priority, but say future studies from more diverse populations that account for both preparation methods and substitution analysis are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

We’re wired to optimally poop at certain times: within the first one or two hours upon waking, soon after eating meals, after a cup of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2022/coffee-vs-tea-nutrition-health/" target="_blank"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; and after &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/08/19/running-gut-gastrointestinal-nausea-diarrhea-bleeding/" target="_blank"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;. These classic triggers tell our colon to start contracting — propelling our poop forward and helping us feel the “urgency” to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XJEMUYW6V5FBRF5Z7PWXDQMHQU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When we travel, everything about our routine goes awry. We’re running around and become easily stressed, which greatly alters our poop patterns, and we’re often left with no choice but a public bathroom when we feel the call. That alone creates so much &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/06/02/pooping-at-work/" target="_blank"&gt;poop anxiety&lt;/a&gt; that people are just unable to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VWBXCNCS3ZCGZBWEC4PBDVF4F4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Furthermore, when we travel, we tend to drink less water, eat more processed, carb-rich foods either on the go or indulging at restaurants, and we rarely get to drink coffee and exercise the same ways we do in the comfort of our home routines (sitting for hours on a plane isn’t helping your bowels one bit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O3XM7ZE6SNCRXM6PKYBZ25OLAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Because of all this, traveler’s constipation is quite common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GPTVGWUDLZEGPOMGYUXCC4FKKY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I strongly recommend you start taking something that will help at the start of the trip — even a day or two before leaving. It’s always easier to get ahead of a problem than to chase after it when it becomes a crisis. Start with something easy like an extra fiber supplement or MiraLax, which is a mild laxative that pulls water into your intestine. If that doesn’t do the trick and you find you’re seriously backed up, go for a stimulant laxative like senna, which you can pick up over the counter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WEHGUO4SGZDD5EANZKMXV222FI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;My brother has watery, loose stools, four or more times a day. He does admit that it would be nice not to go so often, so what OTC remedy could he try?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2VK6ISEWKBGKDI3ZSCOH4GFPOA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You don’t &lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt; to poop once a day to be healthy. The number of times we poop depends on a multitude of individual factors — our diets, our exercise patterns, how stressed we are and our circadian rhythm to name a few (did you know that, unlike many other organs, your colon rises and shines just like you do — it’s why having a bowel movement in the first hours after waking is easier than later in the day!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZHYJWNH7T5E3HJ3UGT3PYR5VKE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So I tell my patients that “normal” is what’s comfortable for you. In general, &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/ajg/fulltext/2018/01000/characterizing_normal_bowel_frequency_and.21.aspx?itid=lk_inline_manual_pubble" target="_blank"&gt;Americans think&lt;/a&gt; that anywhere from three bowel movements per week to three bowel movements per day is “normal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YDLQKNOT6ZFDJISPAIXPXW6XQU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It sounds like, for the most part, your brother is pleased with his habits. Four stools a day is on the higher end of typical, and I can’t comment specifically on his situation without knowing his whole history. But assuming all else is stable, and he’s perfectly content, I might let someone like this be. If he finds that the frequent call of nature is interfering with his ability to socialize, or leading to discomfort, he should absolutely talk to his physician. “Change” is definitely possible (“improvement,” however, depends on your perspective here).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TYEUOSEW6NBFBL44DZ2FN5PTEU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Perhaps the thing I love most about your asking this is that you and your brother seem to have a healthy open dialogue about poop! In so many families, this is not the case. In my own poop-friendly family, my father is also a gastroenterologist, so you can imagine what a delight the pair of us are at dinner parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FIMWQ65GBJBX3GGDGQ5QGNPDHQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;After being as regular and predictable as Old Faithful until the age of roughly 48 (I’m a 51 year-old male), I find that I rarely have the sort of satisfying, bowel-emptying events that typified my 30s and 40s.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Is this normal for a man of my age?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PAZRN6B6UVATVNQVHGL6G2LHVQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Lord Tennyson once wrote: “’Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T7IOCJQTTBC6FBODQDK7AK5CJU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The same could be said of a great poop. Much like love, those who have known a life of effortless bowel movements suffer dearly when it’s lost, but I’m happy to hear that you were able to experience that sheer joy for so many years. And I’m optimistic we can get you back on track!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V74TZBUHEVG3NM7QH4YFI67IQY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Our bodies are constantly changing. Sure, some of it is age — constipation, after all, comes for us all and is more common among older Americans. But it’s often other factors for which we may not be connecting the dots: Has your exercise routine shifted? Did you start any new medications or &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/03/31/supplements-benefits-research-science/" target="_blank"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt;? Has stress from your job, relationships or family shifted? For women, are you entering &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/02/26/menopause-hot-flashes-getting-worse/" target="_blank"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AZ7HOA6LBVG7DBNSYZWCWCKM5M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I love starting with old-fashioned &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/01/06/psyllium-supplement-how-much/" target="_blank"&gt;psyllium husk&lt;/a&gt; when things first begin slowing down. Fiber is a powerful, shape-shifting ally — it can bulk up loose stool and also soften hard stools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VUPB7L7WURDLZGKTJK7ICD7YS4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here’s a pro tip: Try taking two &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/07/kiwi-help-ibs-constipation/" target="_blank"&gt;kiwis&lt;/a&gt; a day — a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34074830/?itid=lk_inline_manual_pubble" target="_blank"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; found that consuming two kiwis per day was just as effective in increasing stool frequency and reducing straining as prunes. But unlike prunes, eating kiwis helped with bloating too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EF5NOW63ANGGXMBOIG767RXI5E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since being on Ozempic, I’m always constipated. Without laxatives, I get severely impacted. Softeners and fiber were not effective. Any suggestions?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y4ND44SUXFFLXBYLI7HD3GO7K4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;GLP-1 agonists, like semaglutide (brand name Ozempic), slow down our gastrointestinal motility, or in other words, how quickly our guts can propel contents forward. I know this comes as no surprise to anyone on these medications: the GI side effects are a huge reason many people can’t stick with them in the long-term. This delay can affect our GI tracts from our stomachs all the way down to our colons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H5AGAE5JFBHPPOV34I2WXNBSTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a much-discussed &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183?itid=lk_inline_manual_pubble" target="_blank"&gt;randomized-controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; of semaglutide for weight loss published in 2021, about 23 percent of people on semaglutide experienced constipation and 44 percent experienced nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KDYLJYCWMVGA3BZ2MECKQIHF5M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So what you’re experiencing is common — and as more people get access to GLP-1 agonists, we’re going to have to start being more preemptive in addressing these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YNWTEPA2IJE27C3FYIHB2NFXR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Everyone’s bodies and lifestyle is different — for some, increasing fiber or using the occasional over-the-counter laxative may be sufficient to keep things moving smoothly. But I’d explore options with your physician about what else you can try if you feel you’ve exhausted your options. We have many ways we can treat constipation, including safe but strong prescription medications at our disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LOUUZ7QLTBCEFJIZU33C3JPOJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It could also be that you warrant other tests to see whether there may be any other issues contributing to your symptoms. For me, the main thing is not to suffer silently. If you let your doctor know how bad things are, we can work together on possible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-story subtype-link-box" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 16:00:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxQdnFTNWtsci0tcXBnSkdFd2Z4dXNJdFNsX2lTRkNFZXFqWHF3MzFQamYxMmEtMTd2M3lhWUM5WDVGRXVweUQ1Sml4d0NtbVF4Sm5oUk4zNldTMnFJbTF1RndfeF9rMlI0QUlaMnZTRkRUMkdySk5WdWNFSjYtbE1yNW04TC1RN2ZtbjI3b053</guid></item><item><title>鳄梨油与橄榄油：心脏病学家分享哪种对您的心脏有益- EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxOSmVSUnFVWmVXQnM2VUFuUWM4ZkM0aUdVVW94LTUzZXk4Nmw4TE9tbVI4bnI4LXoxOGk3SEZDSzZCbGxXSUVud2kxUFRFcHNFUGR5Z3l1MGRHcUhzT1RfV09aYm5SV3FMd0JWbEpaX1ZvUjFYTS1KNjVvT1lETmZjRjF2bw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both olive oil and avocado oil are rich in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avocado oil is great for high-heat cooking and blends well into dishes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Olive oil has the most research supporting its heart-health benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Olive oil has long been a go-to for heart-healthy cooking, but avocado oil is quickly rising in popularity for its versatility and nutritional benefits. So which one is better for your heart—or does it make a difference? We asked cardiologists to weigh in.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once known as a niche ingredient favored by avid cooks, avocado oil has steadily gained mainstream popularity. Its neutral flavor and high smoke point make it a standout for cooking, but its potential heart-health benefits really set it apart. Here’s a look at what it can offer for your cardiovascular health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Avocado oil contains a mixture of beneficial fats, with a high proportion being monounsaturated fats.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Consuming these fats is linked with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fats-to-help-lower-cholesterol-8553423" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better cholesterol management&lt;/a&gt;. “Oils high in monounsaturated fats help reduce LDL (‘bad’) cholesterol and raise HDL (‘good’) cholesterol,” explains&lt;a href="https://chicagoheartvascular.com/about/rohit-vuppuluri-do/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt; Rohit Vuppuluri, D.O.&lt;/a&gt;, an interventional cardiologist at Chicago Heart and Vascular Specialists.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Both human and animal studies suggest that avocado oil may help lower LDL cholesterol and increase HDL cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For example, a small 2017 study found that replacing butter with avocado oil reduced LDL and total cholesterol levels in 13 overweight individuals.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Avocado oil is rich in plant compounds that act as antioxidants—like tocopherols, phytosterols and carotenoids—which can support heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These compounds work by neutralizing free radicals, the unstable compounds that cause oxidative stress and inflammation in the body. Vuppuluri explains that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-avoid-for-chronic-inflammation-8644317" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, so taming it via diet is a heart-healthy choice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another benefit of using avocado oil is its high smoke point, which helps minimize the formation of free radicals during cooking. “Avocado oil is known to be the most resistant to high-heat cooking,” says&lt;a href="https://memorialhermann.org/doctors/cardiac-electrophysiologists/dr-khashayar-hematpour-md-1902065543" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Khashayar Hematpour, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist with Memorial Hermann and UTHealth Houston. “As anyone who’s been in the kitchen knows, some oils, like butter, burn quickly and darken, which means they’ve produced harmful compounds.” Avocado oil, on the other hand, can be heated to around 480°F (280°C) before it begins to break down, making it an excellent option for high-heat cooking.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Lower Blood Pressure &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Avocado oil’s inflammation-fighting properties may also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-high-blood-pressure-8769222" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support healthy blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. “[Avocado oil’s] anti-inflammatory effects and antioxidant compounds help relax blood vessels and improve blood flow,” says Vuppuluri. For now, most of the evidence comes from animal studies, so more human studies are needed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That said, a 2022 study found that women who ate more avocados—not avocado oil specifically—had a significantly lower risk of developing hypertension. In fact, those who ate five servings per week (half an avocado per serving) reduced their risk of high blood pressure by 17%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Although more research is needed, these benefits might also apply to avocado oil.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Olive oil has long been celebrated for its versatility and heart-supporting nutrients. Here’s what we know about this classic cooking oil.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Rich in Antioxidants &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like avocado oil, olive oil is packed with antioxidants—though the specific types vary. Olive oil contains a variety of polyphenolic compounds, including phenol alcohols and acids, secoiridoids, lignans and flavones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; According to Hematpour, these heart-healthy compounds neutralize free radicals, helping to keep inflammation in check. In fact, numerous studies have linked greater olive oil consumption with lower levels of inflammatory markers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Supports Healthy Cholesterol and Blood Lipids &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While research on avocado oil is still in its early stages, olive oil has a much lengthier track record of improving cholesterol levels in people. This comes down to their healthy monounsaturated fats, says Hematpour. Studies have found modest increases in HDL cholesterol and reductions in LDL cholesterol and triglycerides with olive oil consumption—particularly when it’s used instead of butter.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Support Healthy Blood Pressure &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding to its list of heart-healthy benefits, olive oil may also support healthy blood pressure. According to a 2020 review, both experimental and human studies suggest that this flavorful fat has antihypertensive effects—thanks to its high oleic acid content and antioxidant-rich polyphenols.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “On top of that, if you consume a diet that has a higher proportion of unsaturated fats, that means you’re consuming less saturated fat, which is the harmful kind that can increase blood pressure,” says Hematpour.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-final-verdict"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Final Verdict &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While both avocado and olive oil are great choices for heart health, the cardiologists we spoke with recommend olive oil for its longer track record in research. “Olive oil has been extensively studied and has strong evidence that it is heart-healthy,” Vuppuluri says. He adds that these benefits are especially clear in the context of the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/16372/8-ways-to-follow-the-mediterranean-diet-for-better-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, where olive oil is a staple and likely plays a role in its cardiovascular benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, remember that quality counts. The olives used and their method of processing can alter the nutrition of olive oil, Vuppuluri says. “Cold-pressed, unrefined olive oil is best to preserve the full nutritional and heart-healthy benefit.” It’s especially great when used on salads or with moderate-heat cooking like sautéing or baking.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your choice may also depend on how you plan to use the oil and your taste preferences. Olive oil’s bold, robust flavor livens up dishes like roasted veggies and meat marinades. Avocado oil has a lighter taste, meaning it blends well into dips, dressings and baked goods—and it’s better for high-heat cooking methods like frying.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although olive oil has more research behind it, both olive and avocado oils can be heart-smart additions to your daily meals. Thanks to their similar nutritional properties and rich antioxidant content, they may help improve cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure and reduce inflammation. Meanwhile, their unique flavors lend themselves well to different culinary preparations. If you have the pantry space, why not try both?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creatine supplementation is booming among those seeking greater muscle size and performance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although creatine is certainly not a new discovery, &lt;a href="https://creatineforhealth.com/creatine-history/"&gt;with research dating back to the 1830s&lt;/a&gt;, its &lt;a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/creatine-supplements-market-report#:%7E:text=The%20global%20creatine%20supplements%20market,energy%20during%20high%2Dintensity%20exercise."&gt;popularity and sales&lt;/a&gt; have continued to grow, and have expanded beyond bodybuilders and athletes to clinical applications and benefits beyond muscle performance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, creatine stands as one of the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.2000.80.3.1107"&gt;most researched supplements&lt;/a&gt;, and new findings continue to support its use for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15092116"&gt;consistent and measurable results in bodybuilding, fitness and overall health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-59745-231-1_11"&gt;creatine is naturally found in foods&lt;/a&gt; like red meat and seafood, and also produced naturally in the body, supplementation has surged in popularity, especially among young men. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Creatine can help maintain energy levels, especially during short-duration, high-intensity exercise like weight training.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;(Unsplash/Gyan Shahane)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This growth in popularity is largely due to young men’s desire to increase muscle size and muscle strength. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.13.2.198"&gt;Several meta-analyses&lt;/a&gt; have looked at the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12020-013-0070-4"&gt;effects of creatine&lt;/a&gt; supplementation during &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/OAJSM.S123529"&gt;resistance training&lt;/a&gt; on properties of muscle, and support its &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0000000000000220"&gt;use and effectiveness&lt;/a&gt; when combined with resistance training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, creatine can help maintain energy levels, especially during short-duration, high-intensity exercise like weight training. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Creatine’s role in the body&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a physiological perspective, once in the body, the majority of creatine is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2165/00003088-200342060-00005"&gt;stored in the muscle as phosphocreatine (PCr)&lt;/a&gt;. In this form, it can help maintain energy levels through the maintenance of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the body’s primary energy currency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because creatine supplementation &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1042/cs0830367"&gt;increases intramuscular levels of creatine&lt;/a&gt;, it may enable resistance training at a higher intensity and for longer durations, leading to greater gains in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although creatine’s impact on muscle performance may be more well known, it does not paint the whole picture. Research is revealing creatine’s positive impact outside the muscular system, showing positive effects on the storage and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpendo.00238.2004"&gt;metabolism of glucose&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/meta.2001.28159"&gt;blood-flow dynamics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2003.11.036"&gt;anti-inflammatory effects&lt;/a&gt; and positive benefits for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2018.04.013"&gt;cognition and brain function&lt;/a&gt;, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dosage and safety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a research perspective, dosage recommendations for men can vary, but typically either five grams of creatine daily, or a customized dosage based on bodyweight of (0.1 grams per kilogram per day) have been shown to be well-tolerated and effective for increasing muscle performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-59745-231-1_11"&gt;food intake perspective&lt;/a&gt;, to consume about five grams of creatine in the diet, an individual would have to consume about 1.15 kilograms of beef, or about a kilogram of pork, for example. This means even a diet that is high in creatine-containing foods may not be enough to maximize its benefits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high calorie content of eating enough of these foods to reach the target creatine intake makes supplementation a practical and appealing option, both for ease of consumption and calorie considerations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, from a cost perspective, at about $0.50 per serving, it’s an easy and cost-effective strategy to reach creatine intake goals. With new forms of creatine seemingly being released all the time (capsules, gummies and flavoured powders), it makes it easy to maintain intake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Resistance training is a paramount component to the positive effects of creatine.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;(Unsplash/Victor Freitas)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the safety of creatine supplementation, a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z"&gt;position stand paper&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href="https://www.sportsnutritionsociety.org/"&gt;International Society of Sports Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; concluded that creatine supplementation poses no greater adverse effects in healthy individuals compared to placebo, even with higher dosages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, creatine hasn’t been immune to its share of negative claims. Anecdotally, creatine may have some whispers of undesirable side-effects; however, research looking at &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-021-00412-w"&gt;common myths and misconceptions of creatine&lt;/a&gt; (including concerns about water retention, hair loss and dehydration) have largely removed many of the fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Resistance training is key&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that while creatine consumption on its own may still show &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00726-011-0972-5"&gt;some positive effects&lt;/a&gt;, it is largely creatine consumption in combination with resistance training that leads to benefits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resistance training &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17041285"&gt;can increase measures of muscle growth and performance&lt;/a&gt; (muscle power, muscle strength and muscle endurance) and it’s the combination of creatine with resistance training that will maximize its effects. So resistance training is a paramount component to the positive effects of creatine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, creatine is not an essential nutrient. Individuals can see improvements in muscle growth and muscle performance while focusing on the intake of high-quality and nutrient-rich foods, a well-designed individualized resistance training program, combined with adequate high-quality sleep and proper stress management without the need to supplement creatine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A healthy lifestyle is the foundation of well-being, including the groundwork for effectively building muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creatine supplementation has made its way into the hands of those seeking the secret to greater muscle size and performance. It is well researched and widely accepted, and it continues to increase in popularity due to the positive effects when paired with a solid resistance training program, its safe risk profile when consumed at evidence-based dosages and its low-cost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While creatine supplementation is not essential, it may be a practical, affordable and effective choice for those seeking muscle growth benefits and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

My husband’s mother, father, and the majority of his extended family are compulsive gamblers. They are constantly in debt, and many have been bankrupt multiple times. Thankfully, my husband does not gamble or have addictive behavior. His problem isn’t addiction, it’s loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;

My husband cosigned several high-interest loans for him, but when his dad stopped paying them back , my husband refused to cosign another loan. But besides his dad, he is very loyal to his family and helps them out when they ask for money.&lt;/p&gt;

I want to help my mother-in-law when she needs it, but I don’t know how to get my husband to draw boundaries. I have recommended gambling addiction services, but he dismisses it as a cultural/family problem and doesn’t think it will help. Do you have any recommendations for how to help someone in this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

Their ubiquity makes KRAS mutations a great target for cancer therapies, but the mutations have long been considered impossible to target with drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-70ab09" class="body-graf"&gt;To accomplish this, the vaccine uses short chains of amino acids called peptides that teach immune cells to recognize and attack&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;cells with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;KRAS mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-718116" class="body-graf"&gt;“The critical step is engaging an immune response,” Wainberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f1b23" class="body-graf"&gt;Cancer vaccines are a growing field of research, but many of these vaccines are personalized to the patient. This means their tumor must be sequenced for a specialized vaccine to be created. The vaccine in the current study, however, doesn’t need to be personalized and would be available off the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-dd31e0" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Killing lingering cancer cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3ad911" class="body-graf"&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03876-4" target="_blank"&gt;Phase 1 trial&lt;/a&gt;, published Monday in Nature Medicine, Wainberg and a team of doctors from across the country recruited 20 people with pancreatic cancer and five with colorectal cancer. (They chose to also include a few colorectal cancer patients because KRAS mutations are also a common driver of colorectal cancers, and people whose colorectal cancer is driven by these mutations are more likely to have a recurrence, Wainberg said.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3f0764" class="body-graf"&gt;Everyone in the trial had KRAS mutations and had undergone standard treatment — usually chemotherapy and surgery — to remove the bulk of their tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5f3c72" class="body-graf"&gt;After surgery, blood tests showed that a smattering of cancer cells remained behind, referred to as microscopic residual disease, which is very common with pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-00c80b" class="body-graf"&gt;“We are talking about cancer that is so microscopic that we can’t see it on scans,” said Dr. Scott Kopetz, a professor of gastrointestinal medical oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a8707f" class="body-graf"&gt;These cells can travel elsewhere in the body and grow into &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/liquid-biopsies-alert-advanced-breast-cancer-patients-new-drugs-are-ne-rcna209735" target="_blank"&gt;metastasized tumors&lt;/a&gt;, prompting an often fatal cancer recurrence. Chemotherapy can kill some of these cells, but some usually remain in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d83449" class="body-graf"&gt;“Realistically, if we want to kill every last cancer cell and really make people cured, you need to engage the immune system,” said Stephanie Dougan, an associate professor of cancer immunology and virology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. “We’ve just been really bad at getting an immune response in pancreatic cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5088b5" class="body-graf"&gt;Post-surgery, everyone in the trial got up to six priming doses of the experimental vaccine, called ELI-002 2P. Thirteen also received booster shots. The whole process took 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5b185b" class="body-graf"&gt;About 85% — 21 of the 25 participants — mounted an immune response to the KRAS mutations, and about two-thirds of those patients had an immune response that appeared to be robust enough to stave off lingering cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7dd43a" class="body-graf"&gt;What’s more, in nearly 70% of people in the trial, the vaccine appeared to trigger an immune response not just to KRAS mutations, but to other tumor cell targets that were not in the vaccine. A few people were “super-responders” who mounted an abnormally strong immune response to the cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-75e4cb" class="body-graf"&gt;“Those people had the best outcomes,” Wainberg said. His team is currently running a randomized &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2024.42.3_suppl.TPS720" target="_blank"&gt;Phase 2 trial &lt;/a&gt;to test the durability of the vaccine and compare whether the vaccine is more effective than the standard of care, which would usually be monitoring the patient for a recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cef6fa" class="body-graf"&gt;In the Phase 1 trial, people with pancreatic cancer survived for an average of 29 months and lived recurrence-free for more than 15 months post-vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-79e4c6" class="body-graf"&gt;“That far exceeds the rates with resectable cancers,” said Wainberg, referring to cancers that can be removed with surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-6ef5c2" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A growing field&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-889a17" class="body-graf"&gt;Cancer vaccines have been incredibly difficult to make, in part because cancer cells have a lot of the same proteins as healthy cells, making safe targets difficult to come by. Only recently has medical technology made the strides researchers needed to hone the treatment. Refined mRNA technology and gene sequencing becoming faster and cheaper has put cancer vaccines back into clinical trials, Dougan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-adb508" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/mrna-vaccine-melanoma-reduces-relapse-therapy-trial-shows-rcna79543" target="_blank"&gt;Personalized mRNA cancer vaccines&lt;/a&gt; are showing promise in both &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/pancreatic-cancer-vaccine-mrna-treatment-trial-rcna192702" target="_blank"&gt;pancreatic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/mrna-vaccines-frontier-cancer-treatment-rcna8886" target="_blank"&gt;colorectal cancers&lt;/a&gt;, but a one-size-fits-all cancer vaccine would make treatment faster and cheaper. Past trials using peptide vaccines have failed to prevent cancer recurrences. But the peptides in the new vaccine, called lipophilic peptides, have something past treatments did not — a tail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-67dc61" class="body-graf"&gt;“That tail sticks in the lymph nodes where immune cells get activated,” Dougan said. “You need something to get the immune system going, and just injecting killed cancer cells or peptides doesn’t work that well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7f58f3" class="body-graf"&gt;More advanced clinical trials will have to confirm the results of the Phase 1 trial, but promising results have been seen in other cancer vaccine trials as well and could pave the way for major breakthroughs in preventing cancer recurrences. Memorial Sloan Kettering is also working on an &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01266083" target="_blank"&gt;off-the-shelf vaccine&lt;/a&gt; that targets a gene mutation found in 95% of people with acute myeloid leukemia. The data from the KRAS-targeting vaccine trial published Monday showed it is likely possible to target these mutations with nonpersonalized vaccines, something researchers long thought was impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-91f421" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“The fact that the long-term survival really correlated with T-cell response suggests that the vaccine caused this,” Dougan said, referring to the specific immune cells activated by the vaccine. “The idea that you can target KRAS is really exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 15:03:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNLS1peXpqalFiUDN6OUczcjNLckpTWVlrZkJJa0tlRXdBV1NMSHZvVjB1RlJMNlBVVzlQUDVhS05QNjFCcjd1Nzk0Nk9QbGNsNWJDZGUwQ3V4QUdFM3I2NWh6YmlRS0ZYYjJDdTctMHdIXzh4MnJTT1ZvcEh4ZVpEQzV5SDBaMm1Id3lTTkQ5LWFaRWhDUTQyOVpTZERBVU1YaUNBcG1QVzIyWTNiaEN6UnA5dE9famVr0gFWQVVfeXFMT2F0TXZmbTV1VDRMT3JkbU1haVByZk93NWNTYzh5d2UwWDNpSllBZG9JQ2ExbWptbUE0MDBuS3l3T2xtT0g3T0xqLWpqcy1jdHhuQkkwMlE</guid></item><item><title>抗癌疫苗可提示某些患者的免疫应答- Euronews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxQS05tN25OY1BXckxDTjc1b2w5Wl9FR3lHd2MxSVZKY2xkZU85QV9Ybk9PQVl3b001TGMyZGtoV193TUo4VVdkUzVqSkNVTjhBRWllVjM1TUd1NTFoX1BmOFZRR2F0UjVoclVfWXVaMjVUOWMyMWFBbGQwV0h4aHpDZS1TR2JVZU9qTGRoa0FISFN3Uzk0MC1JaWFtdUpxNlNkcUFsTUhISlFGLW51cUFadTg5MWZFVk1OZ2RqNmlUQUlRQnNqc0htZzNQZkM4dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;S��E�q  ��Q��aǈ������p��c`0��0-���t�=^��i���O�׷�2�������Hk�;���P�:�&amp;gt; Zlt�v7��S� �����E����ޜI���$�x�Lr-���*jW^���7d�$f�R=���w�g���֕ۙ�Z5�5f��G�b����3�'����%�@P�ծ�.;�]d����%C�nR��Mj���.w0��n���o�{r�?Tm'^���x��h��l:��}�*��V	O������6�;i�x�/aT0

These mutations result in the production of altered Kras proteins that cause cells to divide and proliferate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Writing in the journal Nature Medicine, Wainberg and colleagues reported how they gave a vaccine called ELI-002 2P to 20 patients who had had surgery for pancreatic cancer and five who had been operated on for colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The vaccine contains peptides – long chains of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. The vaccine works by training the T-cells of the body’s immune system to recognise and kill cancer cells with mutations that result in them producing the altered Kras proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At a median follow-up of almost 20 months, the team found patients fell into two groups: 17 who had a strong immune response to the jab and eight who had a weaker response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The team found the former group experienced a longer period before their cancer returned and survived longer overall. Overall, four of those 17 patients died during follow-up, compared with seven of the eight who had a lower immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, the study is early stage research designed primarily to assess safety, involved only 25 participants, had no controls, and looked at two very different types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even so, experts said the results were worth noting. Siow Ming Lee, a professor of medical oncology at University College London, who was not involved with the work, suggested the ELI-002 2P vaccine could be combine with other kinds of immunotherapy, and might help a wider range of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“With promising early results and potentially fewer side-effects than current oral inhibitors, this off-the-shelf cancer vaccine could expand treatment options for Kras-driven cancers and warrants further testing in larger trials, including exploring its potential use in lung cancers driven by mutations in Kras gene,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Shivan Sivakumar of the University of Birmingham, who works on mRNA-based pancreatic cancer vaccines, said it was fascinating so many of the patients in the study showed a clear immune response to the off-the-shelf vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But Sivakumar noted that a key advantage of personalised mRNA vaccines was that they did not have to rely on mutations in the Kras gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He said it was now important to carry out randomised control trials of the ELI-002 2P vaccine and follow patients over a longer period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“How many times have we been down this garden path where we’ve got really excited about the science? But actually, ultimately, the real scientific experiment is in patients,” Sivakumar added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNR1FaUEFDa3g2Um5DVUdJSGFGY3otaWpaZUw2UXFDVFFiVWcyOTlGWU1LcHpHb2VsUmdCYkRsY3NjNk9BcV9MaEY2VEJCN1FYbHlYaGxmMlcxMDdBaGFHTk9MbkhsMkh5SDViSkFFNkFCTXlDT1p3N05VQk5tTEZKdndoN2lWd3JqUVJiamlCYWkzRU4tZjdOZ2V0OW4wcUVVLWlEWnpzMndaYzRjZ1Z0bQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家终于从列奥纳多·达·芬奇的绘画中解开了500年前的谜团--印度国防评论</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxONzc5WWNQWDUtZE1xTE9HNkNQazVUMGYxOVVQQzFvNWhaeklRMUQ1Njd6LTN1SUVhS0VNQ2NnclZyVDRBZ3NZdk83TlRsMUZ4Q1hKTFptT1huTUZqT0tzUUJHbzFuS1o1N3pIWWZXSEVZeWdibGptZ3pyQUIxcEs1TQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking development, researchers have cracked a 500-year-old anatomical puzzle that was first identified by the brilliant Leonardo da Vinci. The mystery surrounds the trabeculae of the heart, an intricate muscular network that has baffled scientists for centuries. Da Vinci sketched these fine, branching structures in the 15th century after meticulously dissecting the human heart. However, it wasn’t until recent advancements in computational biology and genetics that the function and importance of the trabeculae were truly understood. This discovery, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2635-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, combined fractal analysis, MRI technology, and genetic research to unveil crucial insights into heart health that could have a profound impact on cardiovascular research and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Da Vinci’s Pioneering Work on Human Anatomy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/leonardo-da-vincis-sketch-hidden-tunnels/" data-type="post" data-id="73044"&gt;Leonardo da Vinci&lt;/a&gt;, the polymath renowned for his art and scientific inquiries, made significant contributions to the study of human anatomy. His work, particularly his dissections of the human body, was revolutionary for his time. In the late 15th century, while most of Europe still adhered to ancient ideas about human anatomy, da Vinci’s detailed sketches of the human heart, muscles, and organs went far beyond what was known at the time. His heart drawings, in particular, included the first depictions of trabeculae, complex, tree-like structures within the heart’s chambers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though da Vinci had observed these structures, he was not entirely sure of their function. He theorized that they played a role in ensuring the circulation of blood, a precursor to what we know today about cardiovascular function. However, the exact role of the trabeculae remained a mystery for centuries. His work laid the foundation for future generations of scientists to unravel the secrets of heart anatomy, though it wasn’t until the 21st century that technology caught up with his insights.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Discovery of Trabeculae’s Role in Heart Disease&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; article titled &lt;em&gt;“The role of myocardial trabeculae in cardiac function and disease”&lt;/em&gt;, researchers utilized a novel combination of genetics, MRI imaging, and fractal analysis to finally unlock the true function of trabeculae. This study, which analyzed heart images from more than 18,000 participants in the UK Biobank, revealed that the trabeculae are not simply remnants of embryonic development, as once believed. Instead, they play a vital role in regulating the heart’s performance by affecting the efficiency of blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;One of the most groundbreaking aspects of this study was the identification of a link between trabecular structure and the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Researchers found that certain structural characteristics of trabeculae correlate with a higher likelihood of heart conditions such as heart failure and arrhythmias. This finding opened a new door in the study of genetic predisposition to heart disease. Researchers could now pinpoint specific genetic loci that contribute to the formation and regulation of trabeculae, giving them a better understanding of how heart diseases develop at a molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Fractal Theory and Its Role in Understanding the Heart&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fractal theory, which deals with complex, self-similar patterns found in nature, played a crucial role in this discovery. Just as a tree branches out into smaller and smaller limbs, trabeculae have a similar branching structure within the heart. By applying fractal analysis, scientists could study these branching patterns in detail, allowing them to make more accurate predictions about how the heart functions. This mathematical model not only helped in understanding the trabeculae’s role but also provided insights into how these structures might influence heart performance and disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The application of fractal theory was particularly important because it allowed researchers to analyze the complex geometrical patterns of trabeculae in a way that wasn’t possible with traditional methods. By examining the branching structure in such detail, the team was able to identify subtle differences between healthy and diseased hearts. This breakthrough opened up new avenues for using computational models to simulate heart disease and predict how different factors, such as genetics or lifestyle, may affect heart health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Intersection of Genetics and Cardiology&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant revelations from this study was the intersection of genetics and the trabeculae’s role in heart disease. By using data from the UK Biobank, scientists were able to correlate specific genes with the development and function of trabeculae. This breakthrough is especially important because it ties the structural changes in the heart to underlying genetic factors, providing a more comprehensive understanding of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Through this genetic analysis, researchers identified several loci linked to the regulation of trabeculae. These loci are responsible for the formation of the trabecular network, and variations in these genes may contribute to abnormalities in heart function. This discovery could lead to the development of new genetic tests for early detection of heart disease, enabling doctors to identify individuals at risk before symptoms even appear. Furthermore, understanding the genetic basis of trabeculae could lead to targeted therapies aimed at modifying these structures to prevent or treat heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
