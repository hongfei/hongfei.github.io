Now, he’s at a turning point. - Chicago Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE9Vb2JsN1NxVVpOSUdzRTd0bGVBX1ZuOGluN1NjMVFxMTZ5MzVzZUkxNUFrWVo5Q0MzRENTNlQ1VWV2SjlocTVLalVyYkZGRUpZd245cGdSN2xTc0NxT3hqRmszVllTYmprUEo1RUVhMHY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost exactly a year after he was diagnosed with colorectal cancer, WGN-TV reporter Mike Lowe’s cell phone pinged as he drove to work early last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a message from his doctor — the results of his latest colonoscopy, a test meant to show whether six weeks of radiation and four months of chemotherapy had worked. The results were exactly what he had hoped to see: The cancer was no longer detectable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Getting those results, it was just the most amazing feeling,” Lowe said. “I think back to one year ago, when I went to the initial doctor’s appointment … .In some ways it feels like forever and in some ways it feels like the blink of an eye — but what a year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a year that started with surprise at his diagnosis at the age of 44. Lowe’s surprise, however, quickly turned into a conviction that he would use his platform as a television news reporter to raise awareness about the disease, which has increasingly been striking people at younger ages. For the past year, he’s&lt;a href="https://wgntv.com/video/i%e2%80%99m-going-try-to-go-into-this-cancer-fight-as-strong-as-i-can-possibly-be-wgns-mike-lowe-shares-health-journey/10200561/"&gt; taken WGN viewers along on his journey&lt;/a&gt;, talking about his diagnosis in news segments, inviting cameras into his appointments and procedures and sharing  very personal details about his experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is a public health crisis in this country where younger and younger people are being diagnosed with colorectal cancer,” Lowe said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 20% of colorectal cases were in people ages 54 or younger in 2019 — almost double the percentage as in 1995, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists aren’t sure exactly what’s causing the increase in diagnoses among younger patients, but they’re urging people to see their doctors if they experience unusual symptoms such as abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, diarrhea, bloody stools or constipation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer is the fourth-most common type of cancer in the U.S., according to the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a journalist, Lowe felt it was his duty to share his experience with viewers.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;“It’s my job to ask people about some of the worst experiences they have in their lives and be open and honest about it,” said Lowe, who’s won 39 Emmy Awards. “How I could do that for a living, and then when something like this happens to me, not be open and honest with the public about my own story?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe, who grew up in Evanston, knew he wanted to be a journalist from an early age. He attended Northwestern University before taking a series of broadcast jobs across the country. He earned a spot at WGN about a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe is a “born storyteller,” said Dominick Stasi, news director at WGN-TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s probably the best storyteller that I’ve ever worked with, and when it came time for this journey that he was going on … he saw this as a way for him to tell his story and also educate people,” Stasi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The diagnosis&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Lowe was diagnosed with cancer about a year ago, he now realizes that the disease had been building for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About five years ago, Lowe began experiencing concerning symptoms, such as blood in his bowel movements. He knew he had a family history of the illness, because his grandfather had colon cancer. Lowe went to his general practitioner at the time, who recommended a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I fumbled the ball,” said Lowe, a huge Chicago sports fan. “She gave me the referral and I just never made the appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

(Stacey Wescott/Chicago Tribune)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think that’s indicative of especially a lot of young men who are apprehensive about a colonoscopy,” Lowe said, adding that, “I guess you’re also worried about what they might find.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of years later, he had a new doctor. He told the new doctor he was ready to get the colonoscopy and asked for another referral. That doctor, however, told him he’d get a colonoscopy when he was 45, Lowe said. The &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/colorectal-cancer-screening"&gt;U.S. Preventative Services Task Force&lt;/a&gt; lowered the age at which it recommends most patients be regularly screened for colorectal cancer from 50 to 45 in 2021, partly in response to more younger people developing the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe moved on. He was still having some constipation and a little abdominal pain, but he was an otherwise healthy guy in his early 40s. He did triathlons and was known among friends and colleagues for his energy, humor and positivity. He jokes now that he thought, at the time, that maybe he just needed to lay off the Mexican fast food and eat more kale salads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by February of last year, he could no longer ignore his escalating symptoms. He had blood in every bowel movement and felt like he couldn’t empty his bowels all the way. One night he ended up in an emergency room with stabbing abdominal pain. He waited for a few hours but started feeling better and left without being seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he told his mom about the episode, she was alarmed and insisted he make an appointment with his doctor — in front of her. She watched as he sent a message over his phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe got an appointment, and the doctor did a rectal exam. Almost immediately, he was fairly sure that Lowe had cancer. A colonoscopy soon confirmed the doctor’s suspicion. Lowe had stage 3 colorectal cancer. The cancer had spread to nearby lymph nodes, but not yet to other organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ll always have in the back of my mind, ‘Man, I wonder if I had had a colonoscopy back then if we would have caught this as a polyp instead of stage 3 cancer,’” Lowe said of his earlier visits to doctors. “What I later learned is you really have to advocate for yourself if you think there’s something wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sharing his battle&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, Lowe faced a winding path of medical appointments, treatments and side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, he started with radiation. He had about 30 rounds of radiation treatments over six weeks. The worst side effects, he said, were fatigue toward the end and a burning sensation during urination. “Radiation is a lot easier on the body today than it was 20 or 30 years ago,” Lowe said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also making radiation a little easier was the patient in line before him each day: famed former Cubs player Ryne Sandberg, who has been battling prostate cancer. As a child, Lowe had a poster of Sandberg on his bedroom wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two ended up spending a lot of time together, talking about everything from radiation side effects to the Rolling Stones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was unbelievable to me because he was one of my childhood heroes,” Lowe said. “To see one of your heroes like that, in that context, it was surreal.”&lt;/p&gt;

(Stacey Wescott/Chicago Tribune)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe would get radiation treatments early in the morning and then head to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There were certain setbacks, but he just tackled each and every one of them and wanted to keep working as much as he could,” said Stasi  of WGN. “He approached the whole thing with a positive attitude. It was really kind of inspiring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe also continued working through his chemotherapy, which took a heavier toll on him than radiation. The side effects of chemotherapy intensified as the weeks went on. He experienced nausea, numbness in his hands and feet, and the skin on his feet and palms peeled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, he developed sores in his mouth and throat, as part of a condition called mucositis, which he described as akin to the worst case of strep throat he’s ever had — times two. He detailed his ordeal with mucositis, which happened while he was on a pre-planned vacation from work, &lt;a href="https://wgntv.com/news/medical-watch/there-have-been-some-really-hard-stretches-mike-lowe-reflects-on-his-cancer-fight/"&gt;in a segment on WGN&lt;/a&gt;, describing how he couldn’t swallow or sleep for six days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, in general, the side effects never got so bad that he needed to take a medical leave from work. Rather, he went to work most days, sometimes wearing a small zippered pouch across his chest that contained chemotherapy medication, which traveled via a tube from the bag to a port in his chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wanted cancer to be something important that was going on in the background of my life but not completely dominating it,” Lowe said. “If I could have a real purpose and go to work and feel like I was able to do it and do it well still, then I was going to do it no matter what.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe believes that he may have been able to keep working through cancer treatments partly because he was relatively young and healthy going into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August he did live shots each night from the United Center. He worked election night in November and then allowed &lt;a href="https://wgntv.com/video/there-have-been-some-really-hard-stretches-mike-lowe-reflects-on-his-cancer-fights/10255870/"&gt;WGN’s cameras to follow him&lt;/a&gt; to Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest Hospital for chemotherapy the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to kind of demystify cancer treatment or show exactly what it looks like,” Lowe said. “If you can help anybody understand what they’re about to go through, I think that helps, and the position of a journalist is to do that, to explain things and make them more understandable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Daniel Dammrich, one of Lowe’s doctors and an oncologist at Northwestern’s Lake Forest hospital, said he’s already seen people benefiting from Lowe’s news segments, getting screened for cancer earlier than they might have otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decades ago, before Lowe and Dammrich were patient and doctor, they were teenage football teammates at Loyola Academy in Wilmette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s just always been a great guy,” Dammrich said. “Mike has been extraordinarily brave to share his story, and there’s no doubt in my mind that it’s going to benefit a huge amount of people who are going to go for early colorectal cancer screenings so they can catch it in a time where we can intervene in a meaningful way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;‘Keep up the fight!’&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout his treatment, Lowe received support from many unexpected quarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after hearing about Lowe’s diagnosis, Joe Johnson, founder of &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2021/06/24/meet-joe-johnson-the-chicago-cubs-fan-behind-obvious-shirts-a-t-shirt-company-built-on-one-liners-a-love-of-baseball-and-a-little-luck-it-worked-i-cant-believe-it/"&gt;Obvious Shirts&lt;/a&gt;, released a T-shirt that said “Lowe Strong” with a similar design to the Bears sweaters coach Mike Ditka used to wear. Lowe had done stories on Johnson and Obvious Shirts in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you know Mike, you know he’s a huge Bears fan, a diehard Bears fan, so I thought it was only right we show our support,” Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, Gov. JB Pritzker sent Lowe a handwritten note expressing support and encouraging him to, “Keep up the fight!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have really felt the outpouring of support from really the entire city,” Lowe said. “I think that’s kind of a hallmark of Chicago. … You see how much you’re loved and you see how much people care and want to help. That is almost as important as the medical part, in terms of making you well again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in January, after chemotherapy, Lowe underwent an MRI and had a sigmoidoscopy, a procedure that involves using a camera to look at the lower part of the colon. If the tumor was still there, the next step would be surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe got tentatively good news. The doctor couldn’t see the tumor anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CTC-L-MIKE-LOWE-CANCER-WGN019_226866954-e1745587357106.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="Nurses Mary Joos, left, and Mike Marasigan, get Mike Lowe settled into his recovery room after a colonoscopy at Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital on April 18, 2025.

(Stacey Wescott/Chicago Tribune)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe was optimistic about his prospects, but he would need a colonoscopy and biopsies months later to see if the cancer had really retreated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That colonoscopy happened earlier this month. Biopsies were performed on polyps found during the procedure, and they came back clear of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was kind of like singing Hallelujah from the church balcony,” Lowe said of learning the results. “It definitely felt amazing because up until that point I didn’t know …I feel like it’s the complete response I’d been hoping against hope for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Lowe is characteristically optimistic, he knows he won’t be leaving cancer totally behind him just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’ll continue to undergo regular tests to ensure the cancer hasn’t returned. He’s also still dealing with lingering side effects, such as the numbness in his hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe also has no plans to step back from the public stage when it comes to discussing his experience. He has a calendar full of events in coming months where he’ll give speeches and emcee events to raise awareness and money for various cancer-related efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I feel like I owe it to anyone who’s dealing with cancer, if I can be the voice, whether it’s for fundraising, awareness or even if it’s just to comfort them, to show them, ‘Hey you can get through this,’ because at the time you get the diagnosis, it doesn’t always seem like that.

Unlike other digestive diseases, IBS doesn't cause physical damage to the digestive tract, but significantly impacts quality of life due to its disruption of the brain-gut connection.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="shortEntryContainer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;April is marked as IBS Awareness Month, aiming to spread more knowledge about this condition. Awareness is key, as many people suffer without realising they have IBS or what they can do to manage it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_640x362/HT/p2/2016/09/02/Pictures/anxiety-shutterstock_a33af226-70d3-11e6-93fb-3c3e574fb2a6.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Stress and diet are well-known factors for triggering IBS. (Shutterstock)" title="Stress and diet are well-known factors for triggering IBS. (Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Stress and diet are well-known factors for triggering IBS. (Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pariksha Rao said, “Despite its prevalence in India many suffer without proper diagnosis or management strategies. Modern lifestyles, increasing stress levels and changing dietary patterns have contributed to rising cases across the country. There’s also increasing evidence that IBS is closely linked to the gut microbiome and the gut-brain axis — the two-way communication system between our brain and digestive system. When this system is out of balance, it can make the gut overly sensitive or change how the muscles in the intestines move, causing IBS symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How diet affects IBS symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet plays a crucial role in managing IBS. Pariksha Rao revealed, “Indian food is often rich in spices, fiber, and fermented ingredients, which can either help or harm those with IBS, depending on how the body reacts. Traditional diets may offer some relief, but modern diets — which are increasingly full of processed foods, sugar, and fats — can make symptoms worse.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She explained, “One of the major triggers for IBS is food that is high in FODMAPs [Fermentable Oligosaccharides (e.g. fructans and galacto-oligosaccharides) Disaccharides (e.g. lactose) Monosaccharides (e.g. excess fructose) and Polyols (e.g. sorbitol and mannitol)] — short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed in the small intestine. Common FODMAP foods in the Indian diet include garlic, onions and fruits like apples. These foods ferment in the gut, creating gas and causing bloating, pain and irregular bowel movements.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2021/11/26/550x309/pexels-daria-shevtsova-1070984_1637902115863_1637902151004.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Avoid gassy founds: You need to avoid foods such as beans, cabbage, cauliflower, and lettuce during the initial days of your periods to make sure the bloating doesn't get enhanced.(Pexels)" title="Avoid gassy founds: You need to avoid foods such as beans, cabbage, cauliflower, and lettuce during the initial days of your periods to make sure the bloating doesn't get enhanced.(Pexels)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Avoid gassy founds: You need to avoid foods such as beans, cabbage, cauliflower, and lettuce during the initial days of your periods to make sure the bloating doesn't get enhanced.(Pexels)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The expert added, “Caffeine and carbonated drinks are also triggers for many IBS patients. They can stimulate the gut too much and lead to diarrhea or gas. Artificial sweeteners like sorbitol, xylitol, and mannitol — often found in sugar-free products — are also known to cause bloating and discomfort because they are not fully absorbed in the gut.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing IBS through balanced diets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pariksha Rao suggested, “A balanced diet, rich in the right kind of fiber and low in irritants, can make a big difference. Probiotics — found in yogurt, kefir, or supplements — can help restore a healthy gut microbiome and reduce symptoms. However, fiber intake should be monitored. For people with IBS-D (diarrhea-dominant IBS), too much fiber can worsen symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to her, what works best is a personalised approach. Pariksha Rao said, “Some people may benefit from reducing dairy or gluten, while others might need to stay away from specific vegetables or fruits. Eating smaller meals, staying hydrated, and avoiding foods that are hard to digest or cause gas are all recommended steps. Keeping a food diary can also help identify which foods trigger symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2022/07/01/550x309/jusfilm-43seK8CwOGM-unsplash_1656685190192_1656685334925.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Ginger: Ginger helps speed up the process of the movement of food through the GI tract while protecting the gut.

It may ease intestinal cramping, bloating and gas.(Unsplash)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Talking about a holistic approach to gut health, Pariksha Rao asserted, “IBS is a complex condition with no one-size-fits-all solution but by understanding how diet and stress influence gut health, individuals can take control of their symptoms. In India, as awareness grows and more people seek professional advice, better management is becoming possible. With the right combination of diet, probiotics, and stress-relief practices, people living with IBS can enjoy a better quality of life. As we observe IBS Awareness Month this April, it’s the perfect time to start making thoughtful food choices and take care of both our gut and mind.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

So far, so gross. And yet, possibly due to its unpalatable appearance, earwax has been somewhat &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1874391917300891" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;overlooked&lt;/a&gt; by researchers when it comes to bodily secretions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That's now starting to change, however, thanks to a slew of surprising scientific discoveries. The first is that a person's earwax can actually convey a surprising amount of information about them – both trivial and important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For example, the vast majority of people of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10886-014-0533-y" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;European or African descent&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;i id="wet" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;wet&lt;/i&gt; earwax, which is yellow or orange in colour and sticky. However, 95% of East Asian people have &lt;i id="dry" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;dry &lt;/i&gt;earwax, which is grey and non-sticky. The gene responsible for producing either wet or dry earwax is called &lt;i id="abcc11," class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;ABCC11, &lt;/i&gt;which also happens to be responsible for whether a person has smelly armpits. Around 2% of people – mostly those in the dry earwax category – have a version of this gene which means their armpits &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/dependence-of-deodorant-usage-on-abcc11-genotype-scope-for-person" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;have no odour&lt;/a&gt;.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, perhaps the most useful earwax-related discoveries relate to what the sticky stuff in our ears can reveal about our health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;&lt;span id="important-clues" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="important-clues" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;Important clues&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In 1971, Nicholas L Petrakis, a professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco, found that Caucasian, African-American and German women in the USA, who all had "wet earwax", had an approximately four-fold higher chance of dying from &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.173.3994.347" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; than Japanese and Taiwanese women with "dry" earwax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;More recently in 2010, researchers from the Tokyo Institute of Technology took blood samples from 270 female patients with &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/30/12/5189" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;invasive breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and 273 female volunteers who acted as controls.

The most prevalent type is Type 2 diabetes, which emerges when blood sugar becomes difficult to control, often due to weight issues, lack of &lt;a href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/exercise" rel="Follow" target="_self" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section-topic"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; or genetic predisposition. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section-topic"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; has clarified that Type 2 diabetes arises when insulin production falters, a reality for about one in ten people over 40 in Britain. Foods high in sugar can trigger increases in blood sugar levels, and everyday items can have hidden sugars that exacerbate this issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Prolonged high blood sugar can cause serious &lt;a href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/" rel="Follow" target="_self" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; complications, including organ damage and heightened chances of strokes and heart disease. Recognising which food items spike your blood sugar is thus essential in managing diabetes, as highlighted by the &lt;a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/seven-foods-diabetics-should-avoid-30630012" rel="Follow" target="_self" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link"&gt;Daily Record.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Even &lt;a href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/food-and-drink" rel="Follow" target="_self" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section-topic"&gt;foods&lt;/a&gt; deemed &lt;a href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/healthy-eating" rel="Follow" target="_self" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section-topic"&gt;healthy&lt;/a&gt; might adversely affect blood sugar.

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Grapes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Ramen&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Potatoes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Sushi&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Dried fruits&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fruit juice&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cereal&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Notably, grapes are generally beneficial for health, yet Diabetes.co.uk warns against consuming them in excess due to their potential to elevate blood sugar. They wrote: "While there are properties of grape seeds that help to lower blood glucose levels, a single grape contains approximately one gram of carbohydrate. Because of this, diabetic people should moderate their grape consumption, particularly if they are prone to high blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"If you consider a serving of dried fruit is only a tablespoon and packs in 20g carbs total sugar, you can see how easily this happens."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diabetes.co.uk also points out that it's not usually necessary to cut down on fruit consumption, but maintaining a food diary could be beneficial in monitoring your intake. The British Dietetic Association (BDA) highlights the importance of steering clear of high Glycaemic Index (GI) foods, stating: "Each time you have a sugary or starchy food or drink, the blood glucose level in your body rises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Some of these foods are quickly digested and cause quick and sharp rises in your blood glucose levels – they are called high GI foods and drinks."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Conversely, low GI foods take longer to digest and result in a more gradual increase in blood glucose. These are often referred to as 'slow-release' carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31520419" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;An accurate diagnosis of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="159326" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; is crucial in bringing clarity and the right support to people who need it, but current diagnosis methods are time-consuming and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2019.1696409"&gt;inconsistent&lt;/a&gt;. A new study suggests AI could help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers in South Korea trained&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning"&gt; machine learning&lt;/a&gt; models to connect characteristics in photos of the fundus at the back of the eye to a professional diagnosis of ADHD (&lt;span&gt;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of four  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-intelligence" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73092" data-postid="159326" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt; models tested in the study, the best achieved a 96.9 percent score for predicting ADHD accurately, based on image analysis alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that higher blood vessel density, shape and width of vessels, and certain changes in the eye's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_disc"&gt;optic disc&lt;/a&gt; were key signs someone had the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_159329" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159329" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/RetinaScans.jpg" alt="Retina scans" class="wp-image-159329 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/RetinaScans.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/RetinaScans-600x356.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-159329" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers were able to link characteristics in retinal fundus photographs to ADHD. (Choi et al, &lt;em&gt;npj Digital Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For several years it's been thought that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-of-6000-scans-reveals-brain-wide-patterns-linked-to-adhd-symptoms"&gt;brain connectivity changes associated with ADHD&lt;/a&gt; could also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/retina-recordings-could-be-used-to-identify-adhd-and-asd"&gt;show up in our eyes&lt;/a&gt;. If we can figure out what to look for, this could mean a faster, more reliable method for spotting the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our analysis of retinal fundus photographs demonstrated potential as a noninvasive biomarker for ADHD screening and executive function deficit stratification in the visual attention domain," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01547-9"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers, led by a team from Yonsei University College of Medicine, in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach was tested on 323 children and adolescents already diagnosed with ADHD, and another 323 without an ADHD diagnosis, matched by age and sex to the first group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found the AI system scored highly across several measures when it came to predicting ADHD. It also performed well at spotting some of the characteristics of the disorder, including impairments in &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09297049.2022.2057940"&gt;visual selective attention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/abnormal-patterns-in-brain-waves-may-indicate-adhd-expert-says"&gt;machine learning techniques&lt;/a&gt; to screen for ADHD have been explored recently, from analysis of alternative &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-24552-4"&gt;eye scans&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.560021/full"&gt;behavioral tests&lt;/a&gt;, but this one has a few major drawcards. While not the absolute most accurate method in terms of raw scores, it's very close, it's also quick to run and assess, and simple to scale up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Notably, earlier high-accuracy models typically relied on a diverse set of variables, each contributing incrementally to differentiating subjects," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01547-9"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our approach simplifies the analysis by focusing exclusively on retinal photographs. This single-source data strategy enhances the clarity and utility of our models."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers want to try these tests across larger groups of people and wider age ranges. The average age of participants in this study was 9.5 years, and we know ADHD in adults &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-figuring-out-if-its-anxiety-adhd-or-both-matters"&gt;can present quite differently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also room for improving the scope of the system: for example, those with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder"&gt;autism spectrum disorder&lt;/a&gt; were excluded from the main part of this study, but further tests showed the AI wasn't great at distinguishing  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="159326" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; from ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-023-02228-3"&gt;Recent estimates&lt;/a&gt; suggest about 1 in 20 people have ADHD, which can involve struggles with attention, impulses, and hyperactivity. That's a lot of individuals for whom a quicker, more accurate diagnosis could make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Early screening and timely intervention can improve social, familial, and academic functioning in individuals with ADHD," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01547-9"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01547-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;npj Digital Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(CREDIT: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating high cholesterol quickly and aggressively after a heart attack may help prevent thousands of new heart attacks and deaths worldwide. Scientists are now urging doctors to rethink the common step-by-step approach to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/pecans-found-to-improve-cholesterol-diet-quality-and-lower-heart-disease-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cholesterol treatment;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cholesterol treatment&lt;/a&gt; and instead start a combination of two medications as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Problem With Waiting Too Long&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone has a heart attack, doctors usually start treatment with high-intensity statins right away. These drugs lower "bad" LDL cholesterol, which can stabilize blood vessels and help prevent another heart attack. Clinical trials have shown that using high-intensity statins early after a heart attack leads to fewer cardiovascular problems over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current guidelines recommend starting with &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/wonder-drug-statins-may-provide-protection-against-depression/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:statins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;statins&lt;/a&gt; and adding other drugs only if cholesterol levels stay too high. However, this slow, step-by-step strategy often delays getting cholesterol under control. Studies show fewer than 20% of heart attack patients reach their LDL cholesterol goals with statins alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Margrét Leósdóttir, Associate Professor at Lund University and senior cardiology consultant at Skåne University Hospital in Malmö, Sweden. (CREDITL Åsa Hansdotter)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major problem is that two-thirds of heart attack patients are "statin-naive," meaning they were not on statins when the heart attack happened. For many people, the first time they get any cholesterol-lowering treatment is after their heart event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though high-intensity statins help, the majority still do not reach the recommended target of less than 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). This leaves patients vulnerable, especially in the first year after a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/blood-platelet-test-could-save-millions-of-americans-from-heart-attacks-and-strokes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart attack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; when the risk of another event is highest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;New Evidence Supports Early Combination Therapy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research led by Margrét Leósdóttir from &lt;a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lund University;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lund University&lt;/a&gt; and Kausik Ray from &lt;a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Imperial College London;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Imperial College London&lt;/a&gt; provides strong evidence that an early combination of statins and ezetimibe can change outcomes for the better. Their study used data from 36,000 Swedish heart attack patients collected between 2015 and 2022 through the SWEDEHEART registry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than relying on a traditional randomized trial, which would be ethically challenging in this case, the researchers used advanced statistical modeling called a "trial emulation clone-censor-weight framework." This method allowed them to closely mimic a real-world clinical trial without putting patients at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team compared three groups: patients who received ezetimibe within 12 weeks of their heart attack, those who received it later (between 13 weeks and 16 months), and those who never received it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were clear: early combination therapy significantly reduced the risk of new &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/body-shape-may-predict-risk-150629683.html" data-ylk="slk:cardiovascular events;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cardiovascular events&lt;/a&gt; and death compared to waiting or not adding ezetimibe at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If 100% of heart attack patients received early ezetimibe alongside statins, researchers estimate 133 heart attacks could be prevented in a group of 10,000 people over three years. In the UK alone, with around 100,000 heart attacks each year, this could mean preventing 5,000 heart attacks over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Central Study Illustration. (CREDIT: Journal of the American College of Cardiology)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why Earlier Treatment Matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When LDL cholesterol levels stay high after a heart attack, blood vessels remain sensitive and prone to clotting. Lowering cholesterol quickly stabilizes these vessels, cutting the chances of dangerous blockages. Yet many patients never get beyond &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-anticancer-drugs-could-significantly-improve-immunotherapy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:statin therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;statin therapy&lt;/a&gt; because of delays in follow-up or treatment escalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today’s guidelines recommend stepwise addition of lipid-lowering treatment. But it’s often the case that this escalation takes too long, it’s ineffective and patients are lost to follow-up," said Margrét Leósdóttir, senior cardiology consultant at Skåne University Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ezetimibe, the add-on drug examined in this study, is low-cost, widely available, and causes very few side effects. This makes it an ideal candidate for immediate use after a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/eating-this-vegetable-significantly-lowers-risk-of-heart-attacks-and-cancer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart attack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;. Despite its proven benefits, it is still not routinely given right away in most hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Kausik Ray emphasized the larger impact: "This study shows that we could save lives and reduce further heart attacks by giving patients a combination of two low-cost drugs. But at the moment patients across the world aren’t receiving these drugs together. That’s causing unnecessary and avoidable heart attacks and deaths—and also places unnecessary costs on healthcare systems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Proportion of Patients at LDL-C Target (LDL-C&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 01:17:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE9MMjk0V1pZMjlnUEV2ekcxekRPeDFWYzVOVGdBN0J6V1c0bEJKdWxBczRLSnAzbk1taVhWSTg5SGh5emlLb0dxVTUxS2ljclpLLW41TUdFQ21vZEpacmNGQlhhR1N5emc3Q2t5SW16Um1lX3cw</guid></item><item><title>美国医生警告说，像这样吃奇亚籽会让你住院-印度时报 | US doctor warns that eating chia seeds like this can land you in the hospital - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It won't be wrong to say that chia seeds are nature's version of a multivitamin pill, metaphorically, of course! A few years ago, hardly anyone talked about chia seeds outside of hardcore health circles. Now, they’re popping up everywhere—from your favorite smoothie bowls to overnight puddings blowing up on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds have quietly transformed from a niche health food to a mainstream superfood sensation. With fiber, protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants, these small black and white seeds are now a pantry staple in health-aware kitchens globally. Their popularity stems from an increasing interest in plant-based diets and easy, natural nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts also back chia seeds for their potential to support heart health, digestive health, weight management, and even blood sugar control. In a world increasingly focused on wellness, convenience, and clean eating, chia seeds tick all the right boxes. Whether you’re a fitness enthusiast, a busy professional, or just someone trying to eat a little healthier, it’s easy to see why chia seeds are becoming a pantry staple everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;However, there's a caveat!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US doctor, Dr. Joseph Salhab, who is popularly known as 'thestomachdoc' and 'Dr GI Joe' on social media has a warning for those who regularly consume chia seeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says eating chia seeds directly can land you in hospital. Sharing an incident where a man, with prior swallowing issues, ate chia seeds and had to undergo surgery to get it removed after it got stuck in its food pipe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soaking chia seeds isn’t just some fancy health hack—it’s actually really important if you want to get the most out of them. When you soak chia seeds, they absorb a ton of water and form a gel-like coating. This makes them way easier for your body to digest and helps unlock all the good stuff inside, like fiber, protein, and omega-3s. If you eat dry chia seeds without soaking them first, they can pull water from your body while they’re expanding, which might cause bloating or even make you feel uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soaked chia seeds are much gentler on your stomach. They help keep things moving smoothly in your digestive system, which is a big win if you're aiming for better gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another big bonus of soaking chia seeds is that it actually makes their nutrients much more available to your body. You know, chia seeds contain an outer fiber layer that's great, but it also behaves like a tiny shield, so it makes it more difficult for your body to digest them properly when they're dry. When you soak them, the seeds soften and this tends to unlock valuable nutrients such as calcium, magnesium, and omega-3 fatty acids, so that your body is able to use and absorb them better. If you don't soak them, much of those good nutrients will simply go through your system without being properly digested. Soaking isn’t just about avoiding tummy troubles—it’s about making sure you get the full power of what chia seeds have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a practical point of view, soaked chia seeds also have a fun, pudding-like texture that’s perfect for smoothies, oatmeal, and desserts. So next time you’re about to toss a handful of chia into your meal, take a few extra minutes to soak them first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;How to plate your meal, as per Ayurveda&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Signs of an unhealthy gut by Dr. Ishi Khosla&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 00:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>40多岁的女性需要以不同的方式进食，我保证这不仅仅是为了让她们看起来更年轻- BuzzFeed | Women In Their 40s Need To Eat Differently, And I Promise It's Not Just To Make Them Look Younger - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE5JZXZjU3M2Q1JfRWYzUE5vQng0LW9KQ3hsSnJ2YTJZaTEyNmlPVHBacXNzZXN5MTBBZEEtdzM5N0ZSYlZ1ZjI0elJkVlFzb3JqMUFVZ2htRERVVHNWenNmZzRwNjQzZ0VBTFZJUEpRcVVmZUJWVWJBQm5R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a woman who’s in her mid-40s, you’ve probably witnessed a number of fad diets and nutritional holy grails over the past few decades. Now that you’re (just a little bit) older and wiser, you’ve likely settled into a pattern of eating that works for you and makes you feel energized and nourished at least most of the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you may have noticed a few changes to your body in the past few years. “For most women, perimenopausal symptoms might have been happening since your mid-30s,” said Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/faubion-stephanie-s-m-d-m-b-a/bio-20199366" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7866826" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Stephanie Faubion&lt;/a&gt;, medical director of The North American Menopause Society and director of Mayo Clinic’s Center for Women’s Health. “The typical age to begin menopause is 45.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are changes ahead, no doubt, but you can help yourself ease into this next phase of life by making some smart nutritional choices to help yourself age as gracefully as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may already have been noticing weight gain, or a redistribution of weight, with more settling around your belly area, Faubion noted. “We lose muscle mass by 1% a year after age 50, and most adults gain about a pound and a half each year progressively through middle age,” Faubion said. But she said weight gain, while challenging, isn’t inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can’t exercise it all off, so you need to pay attention to what you’re eating,” she said. “You don’t have to deprive yourself, though, and you can have a beautiful, healthy diet that’s filled with fruits and vegetables.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s your "window of opportunity" to eat more nitrate-rich veggies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/midlife.strong" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7866826"&gt;Maryann Jacobsen&lt;/a&gt; is a registered dietitian and midlife health expert who noted that “many women over age 45 are at an increased risk for nutrient deficiencies, even when they eat the way they always have.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said this might be the best possible moment to switch things around on your plate. “Health experts call the time of life a ‘window of opportunity,’” she said. “That’s because the decisions we make at midlife will affect our health in our older years.” It’s a good time to up your intake of nitrate-rich vegetables such as leafy greens, celery, and beets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These help women increase their nitric oxide levels that decline with both aging and hormonal changes,” Jacobsen said. “In fact, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30954341/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7866826" data-affiliate="true"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; showed that two salads a day helped increase nitric oxide-related blood flow in midlife women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also suggested a renewed focus on micronutrients, including magnesium, zinc, choline, omega-3s, iodine, B vitamins and selenium. “Aging and lower estrogen levels affect how much of those micronutrients the body absorbs,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than one in seven adults in the United States has chronic kidney disease. Your kidneys work around the clock to filter out waste and excess fluid, helping to prevent serious health problems like heart disease, infections, anemia, depression and even loss of appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;Your &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/should-you-eat-three-meals-a-day-an-expert-dietician-weighs-in/" target="_self"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/4-gut-healing-hacks-to-stop-gas-bloating/" target="_self"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt; play a major role in your overall health, especially when it comes to keeping your kidneys healthy. There are 13 superfoods you should keep in mind when considering natural ways to give your kidney health a boost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/important-blood-tests/" target="_self"&gt; 6 Important Blood Tests You May Need for Your Overall Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;13 superfoods for kidney health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Cabbage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/benefits-of-cabbage/" target="_self"&gt;nutrient-dense vegetable&lt;/a&gt; is low in both potassium and sodium while packing in fiber, vitamins C and K and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, cabbage is versatile. You can use it in salads and slaws, but you can also use it as a wrap for tacos, sandwiches and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Fatty fish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fish delivers protein, and when you choose a fatty fish like tuna, salmon or trout, you're also getting omega-3 fatty acids. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/omega-3s-may-offer-heart-and-hearing-benefits/" target="_self"&gt;Omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt; may help reduce fat levels (triglycerides) in the blood and may also lower blood pressure, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/content/7-kidney-friendly-superfoods" target="_self"&gt;National Kidney Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have CKD, you may need to keep an eye on the phosphorus and potassium levels of the fish you choose. The National Kidney Foundation has &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/fish" target="_self"&gt;a chart you can use&lt;/a&gt; to determine levels in specific types of fish. Although, it's best to consult with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Jacobs Stock Photography/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Bell peppers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like cabbage, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/bell-peppers" target="_self"&gt;bell peppers&lt;/a&gt; pack in lots of good nutrients with low levels of potassium. With them, you get vitamins B6, B9, C and K, plus fiber. They deliver antioxidants too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can slice them and eat them with dips or roast them and add them to dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Cranberries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cranberries &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/news/keephealthy/newsletter/FallWinter2013/KH_Cranberry-Kidney-Connection" target="_self"&gt;help to prevent&lt;/a&gt; urinary tract infections. These usually stay in your bladder, they can travel up to your kidney, making kidney problems worse. Fortunately, regularly consuming cranberries can help you avoid this unwelcome situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/benefits-of-cranberries/" target="_self"&gt;cranberries&lt;/a&gt; have antioxidants that can help fight inflammation, and they can boost your heart and digestive health. It turns out, these tart berries aren't just for the Thanksgiving table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Blueberries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've talked about some of the best foods for kidneys, but you can take it a step further. The question is: What &lt;a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/what_foods_help_repair_kidneys/article.htm" target="_self"&gt;foods help repair kidneys&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/benefits-of-blueberries/" target="_self"&gt;Blueberries&lt;/a&gt; deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With high levels of antioxidants and loads of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/why-you-need-vitamin-c-for-immune-support-and-how-to-get-enough/" target="_self"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; and fiber, blueberries are all-around healthy. They can also help to reduce inflammation and support bone health, reversing some of the issues that can come with CKD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Dark, leafy greens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of reasons to turn to dark, leafy greens like spinach or kale. They deliver so many nutrients that they can help you get &lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/plains-area/gfnd/gfhnrc/docs/news-articles/2013/dark-green-leafy-vegetables#:~:text=Dark%20green%20leafy%20vegetables%20are,many%20of%20the%20B%2Dvitamins." target="_self"&gt;key vitamins and minerals&lt;/a&gt;, plus immunity-boosting benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be advised that greens can come with a decent amount of potassium. If you have CKD, talk to your doctor before adding more of these to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Olive oil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich in antioxidants and healthy fatty acids, olive oil can boost your overall wellness. &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/is-extra-virgin-olive-oil-extra-healthy" target="_self"&gt;A study from Harvard University&lt;/a&gt; found that olive oil may lower cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia and some types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond all this, it can help you add flavor to dishes without turning to salt or butter. To get more antioxidants, choose unrefined or cold-pressed olive oil that's virgin or extra virgin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Garlic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another antioxidant-rich, inflammation-fighting food, garlic also contains a specific compound called allicin. For &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5618629/" target="_self"&gt;people with CKD&lt;/a&gt;, allicin — an active compound found in garlic — worked just as effectively to help protect kidney health as a prescription drug. If you're looking for the best foods for your kidneys, garlic has to make the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, it's an excellent way to add flavor when you're skimping on salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9. Onions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the same family as garlic, &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-onions" target="_self"&gt;onions&lt;/a&gt; give you another excellent and salt-free way to add flavor (bonus points if you saute them in olive oil). Onions also deliver important nutrients like vitamins B6 and C, manganese and copper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also contain quercetin, a chemical that can help your body fight cancer, and organic sulfur compounds that can reduce your risk of high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10. Cauliflower&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/282844" target="_self"&gt;Cauliflower&lt;/a&gt; brings the crunch, paired with plenty of vitamins C, B6, B9 and K, along with fiber. It also contains compounds your body can use to neutralize certain toxins, a big help when your kidneys aren't doing their best filtration work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cauliflower does contain some potassium and phosphorus, though, so while it makes the list of foods good for kidneys, people with CKD may want to moderate their intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11. Egg whites&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/programs/core-kidney/patient-resources/eating-healthy" target="_self"&gt;Egg whites&lt;/a&gt; are specifically recommended for people with kidney problems. They give you a way to increase your protein levels -- which can be important with later-stage CKD, especially if you're on dialysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;12. Arugula&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/benefits-arugula" target="_self"&gt;Arugula&lt;/a&gt; is packed with nutrients your body needs like magnesium, iron, calcium and vitamins A, B9, C and K. Plus, it's antioxidant-rich and has glucosinolates, which can help your body protect itself against a range of cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can eat arugula raw (it's a great salad base), but you can also sprinkle it over whatever you're whipping up. It's great on pizzas, in omelets and with pasta, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;13. Apples&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples deliver the cancer-fighting quercetin and fiber that can help to keep your cholesterol and blood sugar at healthy levels. They've got plenty of antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better yet, they're easy to work into your diet.

"This meant that when we introduced the cultured cells, they were able to send signals to each other to start the tooth formation process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Previous attempts had failed, as all the signals were sent in one go," he added. "This new material releases signals slowly over time, replicating what happens in the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, porting the discovery from the lab, and transforming it into a viable treatment will require years of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have different ideas to put the teeth inside the mouth," Xuechen said."We could transplant the young tooth cells at the location of the missing tooth and let them grow inside mouth. Alternatively, we could create the whole tooth in the lab before placing it in the patient’s mouth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we're still some ways away from applying the findings to human subjects, in theory the approach could have some significant advantages over conventional treatments like fillings and implants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fillings aren’t the best solution for repairing teeth," said Xuechen. "Over time, they will weaken tooth structure, have a limited lifespan, and can lead to further decay or sensitivity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Implants require invasive surgery and good combination of implants and alveolar bone," he added. "Both solutions are artificial and don’t fully restore natural tooth function, potentially leading to long-term complications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new approach, in contrast, could offer a better long-term solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lab-grown teeth would naturally regenerate, integrating into the jaw as real teeth," Xuechen explained. "They would be stronger, longer lasting, and free from rejection risks, offering a more durable and biologically compatible solution than fillings or implants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While nobody knows whether lab-grown teeth will become a viable dental treatment, experts remain optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This new technology of regrowing teeth is very exciting and could be a game-changer for dentists," King's College clinical lecturer in prosthodontics Saoirse O'Toole, who was not involved in the study, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9ejj3jzrwo" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "Will it come in my lifetime of practice? Possibly. In my children's dental lifetimes? Maybe. But in my children's children's lifetimes, hopefully."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on lab teeth:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/replacement-teeth-dental-implants" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Scientists Grow Living "Replacement Teeth" for Dental Implants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>futurism.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 21:15:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE1nMmRmQVo4czhLR2FwM1liMFg4am9sWWZsTHNOSEZtN2otV1QxSnBIek9pTWREY25OV0U4V2ExdUJpSzd5Wkc0bnZ3T0RqZFJwVnVKYnROQzBOb2JZbmstR3NRdUdHNkNnRUZJejB3</guid></item><item><title>随着加州酒店工作人员死于与杀害Gene Hackman妻子相同的罕见啮齿动物疾病，人们越来越担心-每日邮报 | Growing concern as California hotel worker dies from same rare rodent disease that killed Gene Hackman's wife - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An employee of a well-known &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-bb2063d0-2385-11f0-88d7-fb69090cb07d"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Becerra (pictured with Mariela) was just a few days away from his 27th birthday when he died &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his early-April statement, Boo explained: 'We observed some mice in [Becerra's] workplace, which is not unusual for indoor spaces this time of year in Mammoth Lakes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We haven't identified any other activities in the weeks before illness that would have increased this person's exposure to mice or their droppings.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mariela said her family feels no resentment towards the Mammoth, as her brother thoroughly enjoyed being a part of its community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, the resort hosted a celebration of life to honor the passing of their devoted employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Mammoth was always such a special place to him,' his sister wrote in a &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/remembering-rigo-a-life-full-of-adventure"&gt;GoFundMe &lt;/a&gt;tribute, which has raised more than $17,400.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This ski season he is sitting at the top of the Mammoth leaderboard with 96 days of skiing on the mountain he loved most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He was so excited to get to 100 days by his birthday.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When’s the last time you pooped? Earlier today? Earlier this week? Earlier this decade? If you find yourself pooping no more than once a week and do not happen to be a sloth, you may want to see a doctor. That’s because such infrequent pooping may be setting yourself up for some medical problems down the road, &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00360-4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00360-4" aria-label="according to a study published in Cell Reports Medicine"&gt;according to a study published in &lt;em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00360-4"&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, pooping too often—like every 10 minutes—is not good either. The study suggested that the best potty line, so to speak, is pooping once to twice a day because that frequency was associated with lab test results that in turn are associated with better long-term health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Study Looked At Poop Habits And Lab Test Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the poop on the study. It was an analysis of various types of clinical and laboratory data and questionnaire responses from over 1,400 seemingly healthy adults. The study was conducted by research team from the Institute of System Biology in Seattle, Washington (Johannes P. Johnson-Martínez, Christian Diener, Anne E. Levine, Tomasz Wilmanski, Alexandra Ralevski, Jennifer Hadlock, Andrew T. Magis, Leroy Hood, Noa Rappaport and Sean M. Gibbons) and Seattle Children’s Hospital (David L. Suskind). It included measuring the bloodstream levels of various metabolites and toxins with long names like 3-indoxyl sulfate, p-cresol sulfate, p-cresol glucuronide and phenylacetylglutamine. They also checked the stool of volunteers for different things such as measures of microbiome activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team then looked at how these measurements correlated with answers that the study participants provided on the questionnaires. This included a question on how often they pooped with the answers falling into one of the following four categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Constipation: &lt;/em&gt;This corresponded to pooping no more than once or twice in a a week, which is considered lower than normal for a human but not for a sloth.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Low-normal:&lt;/em&gt; This was less than a daily bowel movement, ranging from three to six times per week.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;High-normal:&lt;/em&gt; This was pooping once to three times per day.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diarrhea: &lt;/em&gt;Anyone who has ever had diarrhea should at least loosely know what this means. If you’ve never had diarrhea in the past, you are in for a treat when it happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When You Poop Too Infrequently, Toxins Can Build Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team found that volunteers who had lower frequencies of pooping also tended to have higher levels of different toxins in their bloodstreams. Elevated levels of such toxins is associated with higher levels of inflammation and damage to the heart, liver and kidneys. In fact, the study found an association between less frequent bowel movements and lower kidney function with elevated levels of 3-indoxyl sulfate potentially playing a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is a reminder of why we all poop. It’s not simply to “get away from it all” or to provide extra alone time to doomscroll or text on your smartphone. Pooping is one form of excretion, a way your body can get rid of waste from your body. Not pooping frequently enough can be akin to not taking out the trash nearly often enough. Bad stuff can accumulate and potentially cause problems. When you are constipated, you are basically turning your body into something like your freshman year in college dorm room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stool in your gut can be a bit like those houseguests that you don’t really want hanging around too long. At the first, the interactions between that stuff and your microbiome— &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2019/06/25/can-this-bacteria-in-your-gut-improve-your-running/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2019/06/25/can-this-bacteria-in-your-gut-improve-your-running/" target="_self" aria-label="the city of microbes in your intestines"&gt;the city of microbes in your intestines&lt;/a&gt;— can be positive. Those microbes ferment the available fiber into short-chain fatty acids, which are good for your body. But when the poop keeps hanging around, things turn city, so to speak. The microbes start breaking down the available proteins into toxins. This can happen even in healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When You Poop Too Frequently, You Can Lose Nutrients And Fluid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number two thing to look out for, though, is pooping too often, as in diarrhea often. With diarrhea, you aren’t absorbing enough of the nutrients from the food that you consumed and losing fluid and electrolytes through the loose stools. In the short term, this can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances that when severe enough can even lead to life-threatening situations. Over the longer-term, such losses can result in significant nutritional deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not surprising then that the study found not-so-great lab values among those experiencing diarrhea. There were perturbations in levels of omega-6 fatty acid, homocysteine, total protein, bilirubin and a host of other things. This is why you shouldn’t ever say, “It’s the end of solid stools as I know it, and I feel fine.” A balance in between too few and too often is needed. And according to this study, that balance may be in the one to two times a day range.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;The Concept Of Precision Poop Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t necessarily mean that you should freak out if you go a day or two without pooping every now and then. Or if you happen to a have four-or-five-trips-to-the-porcelain-throne day. The study asked about average pooping frequencies and relied on self-report. It’s difficult to tell how accurate people may have been in recalling their poops. The research team did not follow each of the study participants around all day, making note of when they pooped. That could have been a bit weird and prohibitively expensive to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, too, that one size rarely fits all, even when it comes to poop. Let’s rephrase that. While this study’s results can provide general ballparks to aim for, they may not be specifically applicable to everyone. Your body size, age, metabolism, diet, physical activity level and other things may contribute to what’s the best specific pooping schedule for you. Therefore, just like &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2022/08/15/what-is-precision-nutrition-how-it-can-transform-your-diet-and-health/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2022/08/15/what-is-precision-nutrition-how-it-can-transform-your-diet-and-health/" target="_self" aria-label="how precision nutrition"&gt;how precision nutrition&lt;/a&gt; aims to better tailor diets and nutrition recommendations to different people’s characteristics and circumstances, one should be more tailored and precise about what to expect in pooping, whether you are talking about the content or frequency of poop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in the end, it is a good idea to pay attention to your poop and how often you see it. Your poop and pooping are important measures of your health. So, if you are finding yourself pooping no more than once or twice a week or multiple times each day, you may want to see your doctor to get to the bottom of what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;

One day, you’re reading that a specific food contains compounds that can increase your stroke risk, and the next, you’re told that it’s actually packed with beneficial nutrients. This constant back-and-forth is not only exhausting, but it also leaves you feeling confused about what truly belongs on your plate. We asked dietitians to break down the science and share the top six misunderstood foods that may lower your chances of having a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Nuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nuts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nuts&lt;/a&gt; are often tossed aside for their high calorie content. But crack open the truth, and you’ll find those calories come from healthy fats that support your heart and may reduce stroke risk. “The unsaturated fats in nuts are actually very good for cardiovascular health,” says &lt;a href="https://www.meghanpendleton.com/about-us" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Meghan Pendleton, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Meghan Pendleton, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, of Meghan Pendleton Nutrition, a private practice based in Metro Detroit. Research suggests that munching on nuts at least five times a week may help reduce stroke risk by 19%. But that’s not all. Pendleton shares that nuts are also rich in antioxidants like vitamin E and polyphenols, which help reduce inflammation. “Inflammation is a key process in atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), which can lead to stroke,” she explains. To incorporate more nuts into your diet, try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7881665/everything-seasoned-almonds/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Everything-Seasoned Almonds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Everything-Seasoned Almonds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Bananas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to their higher sugar content, biting into a banana is often put on the “don’t” list when it comes to weight loss and overall health. However, this sweet fruit &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009266/benefits-of-bananas/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brings much more to the table;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brings much more to the table&lt;/a&gt; than carbohydrates. “They’re actually a great source of potassium, a mineral that can help lower blood pressure,” says &lt;a href="https://theheartdietitian.com/the-heart-dietitian-meet-veronica-rouse/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Veronica Rouse, RD, CDE;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Veronica Rouse, RD, CDE&lt;/a&gt;, founder of The Heart Dietitian. “Since high blood pressure is one of the leading risk factors for stroke, getting enough potassium each day is an important step in reducing your risk,” she emphasizes. Many Americans &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290730/signs-youre-not-getting-enough-potassium-and-what-to-do-about-it/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fall short;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fall short&lt;/a&gt; of the recommended intake of 4,700 milligrams of potassium each day. Fortunately, you can easily boost your intake by adding banana slices to a parfait or tossing frozen bananas into the blender for a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/251254/almond-butter-banana-protein-smoothie/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:creamy smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;creamy smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many, coffee is a daily pick-me-up, but its impact on stroke risk often brews debate. “Good news: You don’t need to give up your morning coffee. While caffeine can cause a temporary rise in blood pressure, it doesn’t appear to contribute to sustained high blood pressure over time. In fact, moderate [filtered] coffee consumption (2 to 3 cups per day) has been linked to a lower risk of stroke in long-term studies,” says Rouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:coffee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; is best known for its caffeine content, this beloved beverage is also brimming with antioxidants, such as chlorogenic acid and flavonoids, that contribute to its stroke-protective properties. But there’s a catch: Rouse warns that higher intake could increase stroke risk, so it’s best to cap your cup of joe habit at no more than 3 cups a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Oatmeal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long regarded as an artery-friendly grain, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7996442/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-oatmeal-every-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:oatmeal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; has faced some undeserved skepticism for its impact on blood sugar. “Some people are afraid to eat oatmeal due to concerns about it spiking blood sugar. However, you can build a bowl of oatmeal in a smart way, while still gaining the heart-healthy benefits of beta-glucan, a type of soluble fiber known for its cholesterol-lowering effects,” says Pendleton. Oats also contain phenolic compounds that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and are linked to reduced stroke risk. To reap these benefits, Pendleton recommends choosing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7989862/steel-cut-rolled-or-instant-oats-which-is-the-healthiest/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:steel-cut or rolled oats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;steel-cut or rolled oats&lt;/a&gt; over instant oats, which are more processed and may be more rapidly digested. She also advises pairing your oatmeal with a source of protein, healthy fat and extra fiber, like in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/251317/oatmeal-with-fruit-nuts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Oatmeal with Fruit &amp;amp; Nuts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Oatmeal with Fruit &amp;amp; Nuts&lt;/a&gt;, to make your breakfast a more well-rounded meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Beans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Beans are an excellent, affordable food to help improve cardiovascular health, despite getting a bad rap about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7827647/what-is-the-lectin-free-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lectins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lectins&lt;/a&gt; through misinformation on social media,” says Pendleton. Lectins are proteins associated with symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. The reality is that properly soaking and cooking beans helps to neutralize lectins, making them not only safe but incredibly nutritious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pendleton highlights that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053850/are-beans-good-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:beans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;beans&lt;/a&gt; are rich in artery-protective soluble fiber. This fiber binds to cholesterol in the intestines and removes it through the stool. Studies suggest that this effect plays a major role in reducing stroke mortality. Beans are also rich in potassium and magnesium, making them a powerhouse for heart and brain health. If beans aren’t already a staple in your diet, check out our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sweet-potato-black-bean-tostadas-8769923" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sweet Potato-Black Bean Tostadas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sweet Potato-Black Bean Tostadas&lt;/a&gt; for a hearty dish that is flavorful and satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Tofu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tofu often gets dismissed as a “fake” food that disrupts your hormones, but there’s no evidence that this plant-powered protein is harmful—in fact, it can be &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291534/is-tofu-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:incredibly beneficial;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;incredibly beneficial&lt;/a&gt;. Made from soybeans through a natural curdling process (similar to cheese), tofu has been a staple ingredient in Asian cuisine for centuries. “Tofu is rich in isoflavones, a type of antioxidant that can support healthy blood pressure. A meta-analysis found that higher consumption of soy products like tofu was linked to a lower risk of stroke,” says Rouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Tips to Lower Your Stroke Risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with enjoying the foods and drinks mentioned above, both dietitians suggest embracing these lifestyle and dietary habits to further reduce your risk of stroke:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow the Mediterranean or DASH diet: &lt;/strong&gt;These diets are rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, with moderate amounts of fish, lean protein and low-fat dairy. They also emphasize limiting processed foods and added sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get moving: &lt;/strong&gt;Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise, like walking or biking, per week. In addition, dedicate two days a week to muscle-strengthening exercises like lifting weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quit smoking: &lt;/strong&gt;When you give up smoking, your risk of having a stroke goes down significantly. Try making a list of reasons why you want to quit, setting a date and outlining a plan to combat nicotine cravings. A health care professional can also help navigate you through this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure you’re getting seven to nine hours of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2060332/what-happens-to-your-body-if-you-dont-get-enough-sleep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:quality sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; each night. It’s also important to get treatment if you have sleep apnea, which is linked to increased stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-reduce-your-risk-of-stroke-11698358" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:7 Habits to Reduce Your Risk of Stroke, According to Doctors and Dietitians;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;7 Habits to Reduce Your Risk of Stroke, According to Doctors and Dietitians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many misconceptions about what you should and shouldn’t eat to lower your stroke risk. Unfortunately, many foods are labeled as “bad” based on half-truths that are not firmly rooted in science. The full truth is that many of these foods—like nuts, bananas, coffee, oatmeal, tofu and beans—contain beneficial compounds that can reduce stroke risk. So, the next time you come across a post that dismisses a food based on one component of its nutritional profile, reach out to a dietitian or a health care professional to clear up the confusion. After all, eating to improve your brain and heart health should be enjoyable, and plenty of foods can fit seamlessly into a balanced diet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-foods-to-eat-for-lower-stroke-risk-11722148" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 17:27:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE9xSkp2THBkUnpHUlZsekRkakdCYjdvR1c4SkVLMDlzYkxKb3ZLQ01uMFZmVjB6MGc1Unh2ejF5dXJMa0lHaEdibGYwRjh4M0tlaEo3VVh6X2xjTERJM19DRU0zcjFaY2t3SkVPSkwzUQ</guid></item><item><title>快速简单的数字听诊器保持猫的标签- Hackaday | Quick And Easy Digital Stethoscope Keeps Tabs On Cat - Hackaday</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPMElrYTFySmtZRTNPdDdLVmpvWVhQU2xjR3NnaGpqQ3R0bVRfMXpiX1BxcUVTMUlHLUlFY2hzeHdWOHBiQ0UzRUJiMnBKYk5zOVgzXzFCeFJmX0ZGbmR0STQ3M2dQdkg1bjV1VWJiQ0xKUU80YXZlRk9UUE9iMXJjb3hBNzhpbEVmTThLenRn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" id="post-772957" class="post-772957 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-medical-hacks tag-audacity tag-auscultation tag-feline tag-krita tag-lavalier tag-stethoscope tag-vet"&gt;
    

    &lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For all their education, medical practitioners sometimes forget that what’s old hat to them is new territory for their patients. [David Revoy] learned that when a recent visit to the veterinarian resulted in the need to monitor his cat’s pulse rate at home, a task that he found difficult enough that he hacked together &lt;a href="https://www.davidrevoy.com/article1075/diy-digital-stethoscope-for-cats" target="_blank"&gt;this digital cat stethoscope&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never fear; [David] makes it clear that his fur-baby [Geuloush] is fine, although the gel needed for an echocardiogram likely left the cat permanently miffed. With a normal feline heart rate in the 140s, [David] found it hard to get an accurate pulse by palpation, so he bought a cheap stethoscope and a basic lavalier USB microphone. Getting them together was as easy as cutting the silicone tubing from the stethoscope head and sticking the microphone into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tricky part, of course, would be getting [Geuloush] to cooperate. That took some doing, but soon enough [David] had a clean recording to visualize in an audio editor. From there it’s just a simple matter of counting up the peaks and figuring out the beats per second. It probably wouldn’t be too hard to build a small counter using a microcontroller so he doesn’t have to count on the cat napping near his PC, but in our experience, keyboards are pretty good cat attractants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those nice, quick hacks whose simplicity belies their impact. It’s certainly not as fancy as some of &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/02/25/stethoscopes-electronics-and-artificial-intelligence/"&gt;the smart stethoscopes we’ve seen&lt;/a&gt;, but it doesn’t need to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to [Spooner] for the tip.&lt;/p&gt;

That can include removal of the stomach or bladder, a permanent colostomy bag, radiation that makes patients infertile and lasting damage from chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So a research group at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, using a drug from the pharmaceutical company GSK, tried something different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The researchers started with a group of 103 people. The trial participants were among the 2 to 3 percent of cancer patients with tumors that should respond to immunotherapy, a drug that overcomes barriers that prevent the immune system from attacking cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But in clinical trials, immunotherapy is not supposed to replace the standard treatments. The researchers, led by Dr. Luis A. Diaz Jr. and Dr. Andrea Cercek, decided to give &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.jemperlihcp.com/?cc=ps_URB1EFKZME2461058&amp;amp;mtrc=240012&amp;amp;mcm=240012&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=21607606479&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAACUY6raNQGmtKNPqxUXD9_68gN_zt&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw5azABhD1ARIsAA0WFUEsfdtoNrkFWkDRZPh_q43pIIPf3LuDXkN3l44zhqM1ZzZSazPpEOcaAgF9EALw_wcB&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;dostarlimab&lt;/a&gt;, an immunotherapy drug, on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The result was stunning, and could bring hope to the limited cohort of patients contending with these cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In 49 of the patients, who had rectal cancer, the tumors disappeared and, after five years, have not recurred.

It was August 2022. The tumor, she said, blocked off a portion of her esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach, making it difficult to swallow food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The standard treatment approach for &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-patients-often-better-less-intensive-treatment-study-shows-rcna155158" target="_blank"&gt;esophageal cancer&lt;/a&gt; — chemotherapy and radiation, followed by surgery to remove part of the esophagus and stomach  — “is quite devastating,” said Dr. Luis Diaz, the head of solid tumor oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. “One can overcome that, and there’s a new normal after that, but it’s not like what it was before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Going through all of those treatments, Sideris said, “would have been horrendous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Instead, she received just one treatment — &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/jimmy-carter-drug-immunotherapy-melanoma-rcna153166" target="_blank"&gt;immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt; — as part of a clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering. It’s been two years since she completed her treatment and she’s in remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/250425-Maureen-Sideris-se-116p-0d7813.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250425-Maureen-Sideris-se-116p-0d7813.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/250425-Maureen-Sideris-se-116p-0d7813.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250425-Maureen-Sideris-se-116p-0d7813.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250425-Maureen-Sideris-se-116p-0d7813.jpg" alt="Maureen Sideris"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Maureen Sideris, of Duchess County, New York, has been in remission for two years.

You don’t need chemotherapy, radiation or surgery,’” Diaz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The approach won’t work for everyone. The Phase 2 trial focused on people whose tumors had what’s known as mismatch repair deficiency, a mutation that means mistakes in the DNA aren’t fixed when cancer cells replicate. This leads to even more mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For the treatment to work, “the tumors need to have this mutation,” said Dr. Andrea Cercek of Memorial Sloan Kettering. Cercek led the clinical trial and presented the findings at the &lt;a href="https://www.aacr.org/meeting/aacr-annual-meeting-2025/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=21152382950&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAADrBdMT_RFsPg0d8_6DW1lRKXNZdn&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwwqfABhBcEiwAZJjC3p8iqS1RGj8bumvKzKrO5ALMys4qwvrswsSucJZ3DDWPTIT3dMRURhoCvVIQAvD_BwE" target="_blank"&gt;American Association for Cancer Research’s&lt;/a&gt; annual meeting on Sunday in Chicago. The research was simultaneously published in &lt;a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2404512" target="_blank"&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Mismatch repair deficiency occurs &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9582475/" target="_blank"&gt;more frequently&lt;/a&gt; in some cancers than in others. About 16% of ovarian cancers and as much as 30% of endometrial cancers have the mutation, compared to 10%-20% of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959804922004464#:~:text=Microsatellite%20unstable%20(MSI)%20colorectal%20cancers,MMR%20system%20(Lynch%20syndrome)." target="_blank"&gt;colorectal cancers&lt;/a&gt;. Between 8% and 22% of nonmetastatic &lt;a href="https://jnccn.org/view/journals/jnccn/22/3/article-e237103.xml" target="_blank"&gt;gastroesophageal cancers&lt;/a&gt; are mismatch repair deficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Immunotherapy drugs work by teaching a person’s immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. The drugs have been found to work particularly well against tumors with mismatch repair deficiencies, because the many mutations provide more targets for immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, the drugs typically aren’t used as a first-line treatment for these cancers. Instead, they’re brought in if approaches like chemotherapy and radiation don’t work, or if a cancer returns or has already spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The new trial expanded on a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2201445" target="_blank"&gt;smaller study&lt;/a&gt; from Cercek that used the immunotherapy drug dostarlimab as the first treatment in 12 people with rectal cancers that were advanced but had not spread elsewhere in the body. All of the people’s tumors had mismatch repair deficiencies. Everyone underwent immunotherapy treatment for at least six months. At the end of that time, all 12 had a complete response, meaning there was no evidence of the tumor remaining. None of them had to undergo other cancer treatments that would usually be used to treat these types of cancer, including surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers started with rectal cancers because the treatments, and in particular the surgery, can be life-changing. Surgery may involve removing the rectum — the final portion of the large intestine before the anus. Patients who undergo this surgery must have &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/colon-cancer-young-people-describe-signs-ignored-rcna129838" target="_blank"&gt;a colostomy&lt;/a&gt;, an operation where the intestine is rerouted to a hole made in the abdomen for stool to pass out of the body into what’s known as an ostomy bag. “This will have a significant impact on your quality of life,” Diaz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The second part of the trial expanded the treatment to more people, including patients with other cancers known to have mismatch repair deficiencies, including cancers of the esophagus; endometrium; kidney and ureters; and liver, gallbladder and bile ducts. Everyone enrolled in the trial had early-stage cancer, meaning it hadn’t spread to other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Sideris was one of the first people with a noncolorectal cancer to be cleared for the treatment in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;During her first appointment, Sideris was hooked up to an IV that dripped the immunotherapy into her bloodstream. “Within 45 minutes, it’s done,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Sideris repeated the process every three weeks over the next six months as Cercek and her team enrolled other people who had recently been diagnosed with cancer. They were divided into two categories: those with &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/colon-cancer-young-people-dna-damage-gut-toxin-antibiotics-rcna202572" target="_blank"&gt;colorectal cancers&lt;/a&gt;, and those with the other types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The first group, rectal cancers, included 49 patients who completed six months of immunotherapy. All of them responded to the therapy and didn’t need surgery, chemotherapy or radiation. About 75% of them were still cancer-free a year or more after completing the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In the second group, 54 people completed the six-month treatment, and 35 — about 61% — had complete responses and didn’t need to undergo further treatment. The researchers didn't look at data on the patients’ 12-month results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Sideris said she’s grateful she didn’t have to endure the side effects of chemotherapy, but the immunotherapy did cause kidney failure, a known side effect of the drug. She’s now taking medication to manage the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Still, Sideris said, “it was like winning the lottery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Suneel Kamath, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic, cautioned that mismatch repair deficiencies only account for “1%-2% of cancers at most.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Unfortunately, this is not going to be something that is a cure-all,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But for people who do have this type of cancer, the findings offer substantial hope: Cancer surgery can often be “life-altering,” Kamath said. “A huge number might not need surgery at all and can be cured from the immunotherapy alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Diaz said that for patients with mismatch repair deficiency, it may be possible to avoid 80% of surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Being able to preserve people’s organs by avoiding surgery can have a huge effect on quality of life. Depending on the surgery, patients could experience sexual dysfunction, loss of bowel control, acid reflux and infertility. Chemotherapy and radiation can also hurt fertility.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Navigating the endless advice on what to eat for better brain and blood vessel health can leave you feeling dizzy. One day, you’re reading that a specific food contains compounds that can increase your stroke risk, and the next, you’re told that it’s actually packed with beneficial nutrients. This constant back-and-forth is not only exhausting, but it also leaves you feeling confused about what truly belongs on your plate. We asked dietitians to break down the science and share the top six misunderstood foods that may lower your chances of having a stroke.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Nuts&lt;/a&gt; are often tossed aside for their high calorie content. But crack open the truth, and you’ll find those calories come from healthy fats that support your heart and may reduce stroke risk. “The unsaturated fats in nuts are actually very good for cardiovascular health,” says &lt;a href="https://www.meghanpendleton.com/about-us" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Meghan Pendleton, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, of Meghan Pendleton Nutrition, a private practice based in Metro Detroit.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research suggests that munching on nuts at least five times a week may help reduce stroke risk by 19%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But that’s not all. Pendleton shares that nuts are also rich in antioxidants like vitamin E and polyphenols, which help reduce inflammation. “Inflammation is a key process in atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), which can lead to stroke,” she explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To incorporate more nuts into your diet, try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7881665/everything-seasoned-almonds/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Everything-Seasoned Almonds&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thanks to their higher sugar content, biting into a banana is often put on the “don’t” list when it comes to weight loss and overall health. However, this sweet fruit &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009266/benefits-of-bananas/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;brings much more to the table&lt;/a&gt; than carbohydrates. “They’re actually a great source of potassium, a mineral that can help lower blood pressure,” says &lt;a href="https://theheartdietitian.com/the-heart-dietitian-meet-veronica-rouse/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Veronica Rouse, RD, CDE&lt;/a&gt;, founder of The Heart Dietitian. “Since high blood pressure is one of the leading risk factors for stroke, getting enough potassium each day is an important step in reducing your risk,” she emphasizes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Many Americans &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290730/signs-youre-not-getting-enough-potassium-and-what-to-do-about-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;fall short&lt;/a&gt; of the recommended intake of 4,700 milligrams of potassium each day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fortunately, you can easily boost your intake by adding banana slices to a parfait or tossing frozen bananas into the blender for a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/251254/almond-butter-banana-protein-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;creamy smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For many, coffee is a daily pick-me-up, but its impact on stroke risk often brews debate. “Good news: You don’t need to give up your morning coffee. While caffeine can cause a temporary rise in blood pressure, it doesn’t appear to contribute to sustained high blood pressure over time. In fact, moderate [filtered] coffee consumption (2 to 3 cups per day) has been linked to a lower risk of stroke in long-term studies,” says Rouse.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; is best known for its caffeine content, this beloved beverage is also brimming with antioxidants, such as chlorogenic acid and flavonoids, that contribute to its stroke-protective properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But there’s a catch: Rouse warns that higher intake could increase stroke risk, so it’s best to cap your cup of joe habit at no more than 3 cups a day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Long regarded as an artery-friendly grain, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7996442/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-oatmeal-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; has faced some undeserved skepticism for its impact on blood sugar. “Some people are afraid to eat oatmeal due to concerns about it spiking blood sugar. However, you can build a bowl of oatmeal in a smart way, while still gaining the heart-healthy benefits of beta-glucan, a type of soluble fiber known for its cholesterol-lowering effects,” says Pendleton.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Oats also contain phenolic compounds that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and are linked to reduced stroke risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To reap these benefits, Pendleton recommends choosing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7989862/steel-cut-rolled-or-instant-oats-which-is-the-healthiest/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;steel-cut or rolled oats&lt;/a&gt; over instant oats, which are more processed and may be more rapidly digested. She also advises pairing your oatmeal with a source of protein, healthy fat and extra fiber, like in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/251317/oatmeal-with-fruit-nuts/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Oatmeal with Fruit &amp;amp; Nuts&lt;/a&gt;, to make your breakfast a more well-rounded meal.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Beans are an excellent, affordable food to help improve cardiovascular health, despite getting a bad rap about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7827647/what-is-the-lectin-free-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lectins&lt;/a&gt; through misinformation on social media,” says Pendleton. Lectins are proteins associated with symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The reality is that properly soaking and cooking beans helps to neutralize lectins, making them not only safe but incredibly nutritious.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pendleton highlights that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053850/are-beans-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;beans&lt;/a&gt; are rich in artery-protective soluble fiber. This fiber binds to cholesterol in the intestines and removes it through the stool. Studies suggest that this effect plays a major role in reducing stroke mortality.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Beans are also rich in potassium and magnesium, making them a powerhouse for heart and brain health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If beans aren’t already a staple in your diet, check out our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sweet-potato-black-bean-tostadas-8769923" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Sweet Potato-Black Bean Tostadas&lt;/a&gt; for a hearty dish that is flavorful and satisfying.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tofu often gets dismissed as a “fake” food that disrupts your hormones, but there’s no evidence that this plant-powered protein is harmful—in fact, it can be &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291534/is-tofu-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;incredibly beneficial&lt;/a&gt;. Made from soybeans through a natural curdling process (similar to cheese), tofu has been a staple ingredient in Asian cuisine for centuries. “Tofu is rich in isoflavones, a type of antioxidant that can support healthy blood pressure. A meta-analysis found that higher consumption of soy products like tofu was linked to a lower risk of stroke,” says Rouse.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Along with enjoying the foods and drinks mentioned above, both dietitians suggest embracing these lifestyle and dietary habits to further reduce your risk of stroke:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow the Mediterranean or DASH diet: &lt;/strong&gt;These diets are rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, with moderate amounts of fish, lean protein and low-fat dairy. They also emphasize limiting processed foods and added sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get moving: &lt;/strong&gt;Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise, like walking or biking, per week. In addition, dedicate two days a week to muscle-strengthening exercises like lifting weights.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quit smoking: &lt;/strong&gt;When you give up smoking, your risk of having a stroke goes down significantly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Try making a list of reasons why you want to quit, setting a date and outlining a plan to combat nicotine cravings. A health care professional can also help navigate you through this process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure you’re getting seven to nine hours of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2060332/what-happens-to-your-body-if-you-dont-get-enough-sleep/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; each night. It’s also important to get treatment if you have sleep apnea, which is linked to increased stroke risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are many misconceptions about what you should and shouldn’t eat to lower your stroke risk. Unfortunately, many foods are labeled as “bad” based on half-truths that are not firmly rooted in science. The full truth is that many of these foods—like nuts, bananas, coffee, oatmeal, tofu and beans—contain beneficial compounds that can reduce stroke risk. So, the next time you come across a post that dismisses a food based on one component of its nutritional profile, reach out to a dietitian or a health care professional to clear up the confusion. After all, eating to improve your brain and heart health should be enjoyable, and plenty of foods can fit seamlessly into a balanced diet.&lt;br&gt;

But crack open the truth, and you’ll find those calories come from healthy fats that support your heart and may reduce stroke risk. “The unsaturated fats in nuts are actually very good for cardiovascular health,” says &lt;a href="https://www.meghanpendleton.com/about-us" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Meghan Pendleton, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Meghan Pendleton, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, of Meghan Pendleton Nutrition, a private practice based in Metro Detroit. Research suggests that munching on nuts at least five times a week may help reduce stroke risk by 19%. But that’s not all. Pendleton shares that nuts are also rich in antioxidants like vitamin E and polyphenols, which help reduce inflammation. “Inflammation is a key process in atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), which can lead to stroke,” she explains. To incorporate more nuts into your diet, try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7881665/everything-seasoned-almonds/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Everything-Seasoned Almonds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Everything-Seasoned Almonds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;2. Bananas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Thanks to their higher sugar content, biting into a banana is often put on the “don’t” list when it comes to weight loss and overall health. However, this sweet fruit &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009266/benefits-of-bananas/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brings much more to the table;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;brings much more to the table&lt;/a&gt; than carbohydrates. “They’re actually a great source of potassium, a mineral that can help lower blood pressure,” says &lt;a href="https://theheartdietitian.com/the-heart-dietitian-meet-veronica-rouse/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Veronica Rouse, RD, CDE;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Veronica Rouse, RD, CDE&lt;/a&gt;, founder of The Heart Dietitian. “Since high blood pressure is one of the leading risk factors for stroke, getting enough potassium each day is an important step in reducing your risk,” she emphasizes. Many Americans &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290730/signs-youre-not-getting-enough-potassium-and-what-to-do-about-it/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fall short;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;fall short&lt;/a&gt; of the recommended intake of 4,700 milligrams of potassium each day. Fortunately, you can easily boost your intake by adding banana slices to a parfait or tossing frozen bananas into the blender for a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/251254/almond-butter-banana-protein-smoothie/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:creamy smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;creamy smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;3. Coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For many, coffee is a daily pick-me-up, but its impact on stroke risk often brews debate. “Good news: You don’t need to give up your morning coffee. While caffeine can cause a temporary rise in blood pressure, it doesn’t appear to contribute to sustained high blood pressure over time. In fact, moderate [filtered] coffee consumption (2 to 3 cups per day) has been linked to a lower risk of stroke in long-term studies,” says Rouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Although &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:coffee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; is best known for its caffeine content, this beloved beverage is also brimming with antioxidants, such as chlorogenic acid and flavonoids, that contribute to its stroke-protective properties. But there’s a catch: Rouse warns that higher intake could increase stroke risk, so it’s best to cap your cup of joe habit at no more than 3 cups a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;4. Oatmeal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Long regarded as an artery-friendly grain, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7996442/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-oatmeal-every-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:oatmeal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; has faced some undeserved skepticism for its impact on blood sugar. “Some people are afraid to eat oatmeal due to concerns about it spiking blood sugar. However, you can build a bowl of oatmeal in a smart way, while still gaining the heart-healthy benefits of beta-glucan, a type of soluble fiber known for its cholesterol-lowering effects,” says Pendleton. Oats also contain phenolic compounds that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and are linked to reduced stroke risk. To reap these benefits, Pendleton recommends choosing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7989862/steel-cut-rolled-or-instant-oats-which-is-the-healthiest/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:steel-cut or rolled oats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;steel-cut or rolled oats&lt;/a&gt; over instant oats, which are more processed and may be more rapidly digested. She also advises pairing your oatmeal with a source of protein, healthy fat and extra fiber, like in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/251317/oatmeal-with-fruit-nuts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Oatmeal with Fruit &amp;amp; Nuts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Oatmeal with Fruit &amp;amp; Nuts&lt;/a&gt;, to make your breakfast a more well-rounded meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;5. Beans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Beans are an excellent, affordable food to help improve cardiovascular health, despite getting a bad rap about &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7827647/what-is-the-lectin-free-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lectins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;lectins&lt;/a&gt; through misinformation on social media,” says Pendleton. Lectins are proteins associated with symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. The reality is that properly soaking and cooking beans helps to neutralize lectins, making them not only safe but incredibly nutritious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pendleton highlights that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053850/are-beans-good-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:beans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;beans&lt;/a&gt; are rich in artery-protective soluble fiber. This fiber binds to cholesterol in the intestines and removes it through the stool. Studies suggest that this effect plays a major role in reducing stroke mortality. Beans are also rich in potassium and magnesium, making them a powerhouse for heart and brain health. If beans aren’t already a staple in your diet, check out our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sweet-potato-black-bean-tostadas-8769923" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sweet Potato-Black Bean Tostadas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Sweet Potato-Black Bean Tostadas&lt;/a&gt; for a hearty dish that is flavorful and satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;6. Tofu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Tofu often gets dismissed as a “fake” food that disrupts your hormones, but there’s no evidence that this plant-powered protein is harmful—in fact, it can be &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291534/is-tofu-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:incredibly beneficial;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;incredibly beneficial&lt;/a&gt;. Made from soybeans through a natural curdling process (similar to cheese), tofu has been a staple ingredient in Asian cuisine for centuries. “Tofu is rich in isoflavones, a type of antioxidant that can support healthy blood pressure. A meta-analysis found that higher consumption of soy products like tofu was linked to a lower risk of stroke,” says Rouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Other Tips to Lower Your Stroke Risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Along with enjoying the foods and drinks mentioned above, both dietitians suggest embracing these lifestyle and dietary habits to further reduce your risk of stroke:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow the Mediterranean or DASH diet: &lt;/strong&gt;These diets are rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, with moderate amounts of fish, lean protein and low-fat dairy. They also emphasize limiting processed foods and added sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get moving: &lt;/strong&gt;Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise, like walking or biking, per week. In addition, dedicate two days a week to muscle-strengthening exercises like lifting weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quit smoking: &lt;/strong&gt;When you give up smoking, your risk of having a stroke goes down significantly. Try making a list of reasons why you want to quit, setting a date and outlining a plan to combat nicotine cravings. A health care professional can also help navigate you through this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure you’re getting seven to nine hours of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2060332/what-happens-to-your-body-if-you-dont-get-enough-sleep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:quality sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; each night. It’s also important to get treatment if you have sleep apnea, which is linked to increased stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-reduce-your-risk-of-stroke-11698358" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:7 Habits to Reduce Your Risk of Stroke, According to Doctors and Dietitians;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;7 Habits to Reduce Your Risk of Stroke, According to Doctors and Dietitians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are many misconceptions about what you should and shouldn’t eat to lower your stroke risk. Unfortunately, many foods are labeled as “bad” based on half-truths that are not firmly rooted in science. The full truth is that many of these foods—like nuts, bananas, coffee, oatmeal, tofu and beans—contain beneficial compounds that can reduce stroke risk. So, the next time you come across a post that dismisses a food based on one component of its nutritional profile, reach out to a dietitian or a health care professional to clear up the confusion. After all, eating to improve your brain and heart health should be enjoyable, and plenty of foods can fit seamlessly into a balanced diet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-foods-to-eat-for-lower-stroke-risk-11722148" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 15:54:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE5lV1VndUlCX1Q2NkJ1VTVhUWRFX1dPY1pvZFF3Ql9Kc0V0VEtOLUtzamhHN2lqdHJMaHFHLUlWQ1pUUE96TlF6bVZlMlluX01NeTlWMnhTdVFBcXNtYVBHQkN0MTBTSEQxTy1WYmNtOW93eWlReEpteERnVjM0SzA</guid></item><item><title>一杯超便宜的“红汁”可以帮助“解锁动脉” - RSVP Live | Glass of super cheap 'red juice' can help 'unblock arteries' - RSVP Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTFB4SE9XWWZBT3l0OUhWeE1vUkFvOFJrTmxXS0ljWTd1RDE5a3Etd2JIekphcTk0ZzktOGM5WUVoNnFUdnloY2ttaGpPZGdWdEZhR3ZEQzRQZDkzZ3ZlVnJxQnN5M0JtTmF4T0Z4bXU3U09OM25JUXhmRUVmckvSAYIBQVVfeXFMUFVreEs0bXJueFJWQmJkdHQ1Z1RHd3RNVFhEeUd0aEx0SVdVYXFucHhIdEhiWE0zNEtzRU1mQzk4bWxMV3JTODIxOTFNZE1KS0p6aURTZjZZQTd0UV8yd2hIQkpzZUV6NVVhXzBadk1aUHBvTFNsN0NnclFDRVdnZktQQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts suggest that a morning glass of tomato juice might be just the trick for tackling high cholesterol and could be a buffer against other chronic ailments thanks to its powerful key ingredient.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This choice of beverage might not be everyone's go-to, especially when contrasted with more widely-favoured fruit juices such as orange or apple. However, the unique tang of tomato juice could well pay off in dividends for heart health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;University of Illinois experts tout this "health hero" drink, attributing its potent benefits to high levels of lycopene. This not only grants tomatoes their vibrant red hue but also acts as a formidable antioxidant shielding cells from harm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; These volatile molecules, known colloquially as free radicals, are implicated in &lt;a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/anti-ageing" target="_self" rel="Follow" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section-topic"&gt;ageing &lt;/a&gt;and various health complications, suggesting that a diet rich in lycopene-containing foods could provide some defence. An imbalance where free radicals outpace the body's antioxidants creates oxidative stress, a condition connected to numerous chronic diseases and ageing signs, reports &lt;a target="_self" rel="Follow" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/drinking-red-juice-could-help-35098915" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link"&gt;the Mirror&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Edward Giovannucci, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, has said: "The shape of the lycopene molecule makes it very effective in being able to quench free radicals. We don't really understand it entirely yet, but lycopene may have specific properties that protect the cell in a way other antioxidants may not."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cellular protection extends beyond just warding off signs of ageing; it could also be crucial in diminishing inflammation and consequently reducing high cholesterol. A study from 2014 delved into the impact of drinking tomato juice on individuals with high cholesterol levels and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings revealed that participants who consumed tomato juice at least four times a week over a two-month period showed a decrease in LDL (bad) cholesterol levels, and some even noted a "slight increase in HDL" – the beneficial type of cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As per the NHS website, having high cholesterol can result in blocked blood vessels, elevating the risk of heart complications or a stroke. There are various reasons for high cholesterol, varying from genetics to lifestyle factors such as &lt;a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/diet" target="_self" rel="Follow" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section-topic"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;, exercise habits, weight, smoking, and alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To complement any medications, modifying one's diet plays a significant role in naturally lowering harmful cholesterol levels.

&lt;/p&gt;

							
							&lt;p&gt;“The Office of the Chief Medical Officer has identified two confirmed cases of whooping cough” and the government said that “while there is no known link between the cases, this potentially indicates that pertussis is circulating in the community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minister of Health, Kim Wilson explained: “Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is an extremely contagious respiratory illness that primarily spreads through close contact, such as coughing or sneezing near others. While indirect transmission through the air or contaminated objects is uncommon, it remains crucial to recognize the risks posed by this illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unlike the common cold, pertussis bacteria can lead to severe illness, particularly in young children and individuals with weakened immune systems. In rare instances, this infection can even result in fatalities. It is imperative that we take the necessary precautions to protect our most vulnerable populations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spokesperson said, “The first signs of whooping cough are like a common cold. After about a week, you or your child:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will get coughing bouts that last for a few minutes and are worse at night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will make a “whoop” sound – a gasp for breath between coughs [young babies and some adults may not “whoop”]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May bring up a thick mucus, which can make you sick [vomit]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May become very red in the face [more common in adults]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Although the current risk to the community remains guarded, the Chief Medical Officer strongly advises anyone with the above symptoms to consult their GP. Babies under 6 months are at an increased risk of developing problems such as dehydration, breathing difficulties, pneumonia or fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Call 911 or go to the Emergency Department immediately if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your child has periods of stopping breathing and their face or lips go blue [cyanosis]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You or your child are finding it hard to breathe properly [shallow breathing]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You or your child have chest pain that’s worse when breathing or coughing – this could be a sign of pneumonia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your child is having fits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You should see a GP urgently or call 911 if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your baby is under 6 months old and has symptoms of whooping cough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You or your child have a very bad cough that is getting worse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve been in contact with someone with whooping cough, and you’re pregnant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You or your child has been in contact with someone with whooping cough and have a weakened immune system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whooping cough can spread very easily. It’s best to call the GP before you go in. They might suggest talking over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If your GP suspects whooping cough, you may have a swab or other test taken, and you may be prescribed antibiotics to help stop it from spreading to others. Antibiotics may not reduce symptoms. You can relieve the symptoms of whooping cough by getting plenty of rest, drinking lots of fluids, and taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve discomfort. Always check doses of paracetamol or ibuprofen with a GP or pharmacist before giving them to a child aged under 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you have whooping cough, you will be contagious from about 6 days after the start of cold-like symptoms to 3 weeks after coughing starts. If you start antibiotics within 3 weeks of starting to cough, it will reduce your contagious time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your healthcare provider is required by law to notify the Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit [ESU] about any cases of whooping cough. If diagnosed, you may receive a call from an ESU nurse to try to prevent further spread. Please be reassured that any details you provide to the ESU nurse will be treated as medical in confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fortunately, pertussis is preventable with vaccination and the appropriate public health response to a case is to identify the immunization status of the contacts and to offer care and vaccination to those who need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can reduce the risk of catching whooping cough by taking respiratory hygiene precautions, as with any other respiratory infection such as flu, COVID or RSV. Please cover your cough to stop the spread of respiratory infections, regularly wash your hands and avoid the 3 Cs: close contact, crowded spaces and confined places with poor ventilation.”&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each year, about 93 million CT scans are performed on 62 million patients across the US as a vital diagnostic tool of modern medicine. However, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ct-scans-radiation-cancer-diagnoses-study/"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; reports there could be a troubling side effect: a potential long-term cancer risk linked to radiation exposure. In a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778?guestAccessKey=afde7c2e-df6b-4e7b-9ced-7a15ed74dc1d&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=041425"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; at &lt;/p&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;, researchers estimate that CT scans performed in 2023 alone could ultimately lead to around 103,000 cases of radiation-induced cancer over the lifetimes of the patients exposed. The study's authors wrote, "If current practices persist, CT-related cancer could eventually account for 5% of all new cancer diagnoses annually."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        And the projected cancer risks aren't distributed evenly. While children and adolescents are more vulnerable to radiation, adults undergo CT scans more frequently, so they account for the majority of the projected cases. The scans most commonly linked to future cancers were abdominal and pelvic CTs, followed by chest scans. The most frequent resulting cancers included lung, colon, leukemia, and bladder cancers, with breast cancer ranking second among female patients. And the study stresses that CT technology is essential, but that it must be used judiciously—with a growing need to weigh the benefits of fast, accurate imaging against potential long-term harm.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        This isn't the first time radiation from CT scans has been scrutinized. A &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/01/the-surprising-dangers-of-ct-sans-and-x-rays/index.htm"&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/a&gt; investigation in 2015 found that up to a third of all CT scans could be medically unnecessary, while experts warn it could be difficult to limit CT imaging because its speed and relative affordability have made it ubiquitous. Still, the study's editors say the new projections should be taken seriously, likening CT-induced cancer risk to other established risk factors like alcohol consumption and obesity. As part of the solution, they recommend using radiation-free imaging alternatives when possible, lowering radiation doses in CT protocols, and educating clinicians to avoid unnecessary scans.

&lt;li class="font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Health experts say how you age matters more than simply how long you've been alive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Biological age tracks your body’s function—not just your chronological age since your birth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="font-meta-serif-pro font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;AI-powered apps now estimate and aim to reverse biological age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;What if you could slow—or even reverse—the way your body ages? A new wave of health-tech startups, powered by artificial intelligence and cutting-edge medical research, is making it possible to measure not just how many years you’ve lived but also how well your body is actually aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;The concept of “biological age” isn’t new, but it’s increasingly gaining traction among medical experts, who say it could transform how we approach preventive care, health optimization, and aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;“That transition—from candle-counting to function-assessment—is significant. It allows us to care less about the number and more about how someone's body is actually doing,” Dr. Bill Kapp, CEO of longevity research company Fountain Life, told &lt;i&gt;Decrypt&lt;/i&gt;. “Two individuals can be 60 on paper but have significantly different risks for heart disease, memory loss, or recovery from illness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Kapp explained that focusing on biological age alters how healthcare providers practice preventive medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;“It's not about waiting for problems but seeing early wear-and-tear and acting before things fall apart. That's a smarter way to age,” he said. “It provides individuals with a better opportunity to stay strong and independent longer—regardless of what the calendar says.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;The concept of biological age is attributed to British physician Alex Comfort's 1969 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673669909507" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="sc-adb616fe-0 bJsyml"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, “Test-Battery to Measure Aging-Rate in Man.” Comfort’s study was groundbreaking because it introduced the notion of biological age as an alternative to chronological age for assessing how a person is aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Age is often seen as just a number—but not all numbers tell the same story. Chronological age is simply how many years you've been alive; &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/biological-age" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external" class="sc-adb616fe-0 bJsyml"&gt;biological age&lt;/a&gt; reflects how well—or poorly—your body is functioning relative to that number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;A person might be 40 years old on paper, but if their body operates like a 50-year-old, then this is their biological age. Because the body is closer to 50, the person could face elevated risks for age-related diseases such as cardiovascular issues, cancer, or cognitive decline. Conversely, a lower biological age could signal better health and a longer potential lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;With longevity awareness becoming more of a focus in healthcare, a growing number of health-tech companies are developing tools to track and reverse biological aging. According to a December 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/anti-aging-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external" class="sc-adb616fe-0 bJsyml"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by market research firm Precedence Research, the anti-aging industry is expected to reach $140 billion by 2034.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-b2a202e4-2 bmropA gg-dark:text-white scene:font-itc-avant-garde-gothic-pro scene:font-light"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A growing market of apps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Unsurprisingly, the number of tools claiming to track or reverse biological age is growing, too. But which ones work—and how do you choose? According to Dr. David Cheishvili, chief innovation officer at EpiMedTech Global, biological aging isn’t something that can be measured with just one number, calling it a complex process that plays out across different systems in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;“There are a lot of biomarkers people talk about—telomeres, gene expression, metabolism— but in my view, DNA methylation-based epigenetic clocks are currently the most reliable when it comes to estimating biological age,” Cheishvili told &lt;i&gt;Decrypt&lt;/i&gt;. “If a platform includes those and uses peer-reviewed, validated methods, that’s usually a good sign it’s grounded in solid science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Let’s break that down. DNA methylation-based epigenetic clocks estimate a person’s biological age by measuring chemical changes to their DNA that accumulate over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;As the co-developer of the epiAge epigenetic age test, which analyzes DNA methylation data from saliva, Cheishvili pointed out red flags that consumers should watch out for when choosing a longevity app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;“The first thing to keep in mind is that these companies are selling something—and that’s fine, but it means you should be cautious,” he said. “If you see big claims about reversing aging with a supplement and there’s no scientific data or peer-reviewed research behind it, that’s a red flag. Real change takes time, consistency, and evidence—not magic pills.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Another company looking to support the tracking of biological age is Rejuve AI. Launched in 2023, Rejuve AI is an AI-powered longevity research network co-founded by Jasmine Smith and Dr. Ben Goertzel, the founder of decentralized AI developer SingularityNET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Earlier this month,, Rejuve AI launched “&lt;a href="https://www.rejuve.ai/longevity-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external" class="sc-adb616fe-0 bJsyml"&gt;Longevity&lt;/a&gt;,” a mobile app that tracks several metrics, including weight, sleep, and diet. These metrics are combined to give users their biological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;“Biological age is becoming something that we need to develop biomarkers for when we talk about measuring how much we’ve improved or reversed aging,” Smith told &lt;i&gt;Decrypt&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Rejuve.AI’s recently launched Longevity app is part of a broader decentralized science movement that uses wearable integrations, health data, and artificial intelligence to estimate and help reduce users' biological ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;Smith noted that interest in health and longevity is growing every year, driven by high-profile moments like the release of &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/205729/bryan-johnson-longevity-blueprint-sleep-gene-therapy-kate-tolo" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="sc-adb616fe-0 bJsyml"&gt;Bryan Johnson&lt;/a&gt;’s Netflix documentary “Don’t Die,” and the popularity of concepts like Blue Zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;“Initiatives like Make America Healthy Again are also pushing conversations about food quality and long-standing health concerns into the spotlight,” she said. “At the same time, personalized and preventative care is gaining traction—even in mainstream medicine, where more clinicians are embracing holistic approaches. It’s an exciting time to be part of this shift.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-meta-serif-pro scene:font-noto-sans scene:text-base scene:md:text-lg font-normal text-lg md:text-xl md:leading-9 tracking-px text-body gg-dark:text-neutral-100"&gt;A number of other platforms also help track biological age and offer insights into aging. &lt;a href="https://store.insidetracker.com/products/innerage?srsltid=AfmBOoqRjMj_RaDIKuw0G9xQ5riw2DP1-S3m3MBDrtQwK1cELGFFatJW" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external" class="sc-adb616fe-0 bJsyml"&gt;InsideTracker’s InnerAge 2.0&lt;/a&gt; uses blood biomarkers to estimate age and give personalized health tips.

Someone weighing 185lbs would burn 56 calories per hour, totaling 392 to 504 calories burned per night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not everyone will burn the same calories at the same rate, Dr Cassidy Jenkins, a psychology expert at Welltech, explained - saying it all depends on &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-9887363/Metabolism-Rate-calorie-burning-stays-stable-decades-doesnt-decline-youre-SIXTY.html"&gt;a person's basal metabolic rate (BMR)&lt;/a&gt;, the number of calories your body burns at rest to maintain basic bodily functions like breathing and circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And each person's BMR is influenced by factors such as weight, age, sex, and overall health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, the ability to burn any number of calories without hitting the gym is appealing to even the laziest of couch potatoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Getting a full night’s sleep burns hundreds of calories. While the body rests every night, it undergoes a range of processes to repair tissues, consolidate memories, conserve energy, and regulate hormone levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anyone can check their nightly calorie burn by calculating their BMR. For men, the formula is as follows: 66 + (6.2 multiplied by weight in pounds) + (12.7 multiplied by height in inches) – (6.76 multiplied by age in years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women can calculate their BMR using the formula: 655.1 + (4.35 multiplied by weight in pounds) + (4.7 multiplied by height in inches) – (4.7 multiplied by age in years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Online calculators can also easily determine your BMR. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Once you’ve calculated your BMR, divide that number by 24 [to get your hourly calorie burn], then multiply it by the number of hours you typically sleep,’ Dr Jenkin explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to BMR, the number of calories burned at night also depends on a person’s body mass and composition, age, sex, sleep quality, and underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recommended number of hours of sleep to aim for per night are seven to nine. During this time, the body undergoes approximately four to six sleep cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When falling asleep, the body transitions from light sleep to deep sleep, and then to REM sleep, where dreaming occurs most frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;REM burns the most calories. During this phase, the brain is highly active, processing emotions and consolidating memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heart rate and breathing become irregular and sometimes faster, while the body’s normal ability to regulate temperature becomes less efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This raises the body’s demand for energy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the dreaming that occurs in the brain in this stage also requires fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A majority of U.S. adults, 57 percent, say they would feel better if they got more sleep, while 42 percent say they get as much sleep as they need&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While burning up to 500 calories doing nothing sounds nice, sleeping shouldn't be a substitute for regular exercise, Dr Jenkins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘While these totals are surprisingly significant, about the same calorie burn as a 30 to 45-minute walk, that doesn’t mean you should skip regular physical activity.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: ‘Instead, it highlights the important role rest and recovery play in your overall wellness and weight management.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly 84million Americans struggle to get the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep every night and a&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/642704/americans-sleeping-less-stressed.aspx"&gt; survey&lt;/a&gt; by Gallup reported approximately 57 percent of Americans would feel better if they could get more sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 20 percent of Americans &lt;a target="_self" href="/wellness-us/article-13092389/Sleeping-fewer-seven-hours-heart-disease.html"&gt;sleep five hours or fewer every night, a habit that deprives the brain of crucial nightly rejuvenation and the body of necessary hormone and energy regulation.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sleep deprivation also raises cortisol levels, which can encourage fat storage and disrupts hunger hormones, such as ghrelin and leptin, thereby increasing appetite and cravings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, sleep deprivation can slow down metabolism and impair decision-making, often leading to unhealthy food choices and late-night snacking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Together, these effects are linked to a higher risk of metabolic disorders and obesity - which impacts about 42 percent of Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Routinely sleeping less than six or seven hours a night demolishes your immune system and significantly raises your risk of developing numerous forms of cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To get the most out of those seven to nine hours of sleep, Dr Jenkins recommends establishing a consistent sleep schedule. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day will help strengthen your body's natural sleep cycle, also known as your circadian rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Creating a sleep environment that encourages restful sleep is also crucial, Dr Jenkins said: ‘You should avoid going to sleep in a room that’s too hot or too cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘A cool space (around 65 degrees) that’s dark and quiet promotes a deeper, more restorative sleep, which is essential for metabolic recovery.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, she said, prioritize physical exercise during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Regular exercise, in particular resistance training, boosts muscle mass and raises your BMR, increasing the number of calories you’re likely to burn during your sleep,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise also helps regulate the body’s circadian rhythm, reduces stress, and boosts the production of melatonin, a sleep hormone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Illinois residents and pet owners are being urged to use caution after a dead rabbit was diagnosed with tularemia in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1101048225389468&amp;amp;set=a.247699787390987" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1101048225389468&amp;amp;set=a.247699787390987"&gt;to the Douglas County Health Department,&lt;/a&gt; the rabbit was tested for the illness after being found in Tuscola, a community located approximately 25 miles south of Champaign.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In addition, a squirrel die-off was reported in the Urbana area in recent weeks, with one of the animals testing positive for the bacterial disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/about/index.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/about/index.html"&gt;According to the CDC, &lt;em&gt;Francisella tularensis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is a bacterium commonly found in animals, especially rodents, rabbits and hares. Humans can become infected with the bacteria, as can domestic pets like cats and dogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s most commonly spread through contact with infected animals, or can be passed via tick or flea bites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People infected with the bacterial disease may develop skin ulcers, swollen lymph nodes, sudden fever, chills, headache, diarrhea, joint pain, muscle ache, cough and weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farmers and landscapers are especially vulnerable to the illness, as running over animals with machinery can cause the bacteria to become airborne.&lt;/p&gt;
			
	
&lt;p&gt;Residents are encouraged to use insect repellant, to wear gloves when handling sick or dead animals, and to avoid mowing over dead animals, according to CDC guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pet owners are also advised not to let their cats or dogs to roam unsupervised, and to make sure that pets are receiving anti-tick and flea treatments.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, residents are encouraged to contact their local animal control unit if they note any significant die-offs of animals like rabbits or squirrels in their area.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s because AI doesn’t understand the social nuances, context or conversational patterns needed to provide accurate and helpful responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A2P7CPYQWFBWDPPSPXV3OJOJIA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If we have an overreliance on an AI to navigate the social situation then we might also be discouraging things like self-advocacy or personalized support … which we know are really critical for their growth and for independence,” Laugeson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YSEPJ5YFIFHIHFPHKV6LCVHOJM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Autistic Translator was built using advice from therapists, and the bot generates answers based on published scientific research and responses in online forums about autism. Its founder, Michael Daniel, who is autistic and has attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), says its instant responses make the AI chatbot helpful and popular among users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GKVQHLHBH5GYLIW7NLEH6YAADM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I found it really took the emotional sting out of the situation and helped process through those things much faster than I normally would’ve,” Daniel said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GPHGRXJO7FF2VGILU3WZ3PJ7TI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The 34-year-old created Autistic Translator from his home in Newcastle, Australia, after losing his job in August. Daniel, who also&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;has a daughter with autism and a son with ADHD, said living in a home with different neurotypes made communicating hard. If he could use AI to communicate at work, he could use it to do the same at home, he thought. Daniel released the AI tool to the public via a Reddit post, garnering thousands of positive interactions overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5NFIIB64LJAM5O5FJG7GRJB7GY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Using his background as a data analyst, Daniel built the translator using OpenAI’s ChatGPT models.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; Today, he says it has more than 3,000 downloads, and it costs $4 to $12 a month depending on the tier. Since then, Daniel made the service into an app called NeuroTranslator and expanded its translation capabilities to users with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7KI5UTYJYRAU7LGQQXAS74E4XI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are other tools that claim to help neurodiverse people. Bram De Buyser created Goblin Tools, a website that offers eight different AI chatbot tools geared for all neurotypes. Users can ask questions or put down their scrambled thoughts into different AI tools to mitigate tasks such as creating to-do lists, mapping out tasks, and weighing pros and cons. While Goblin Tools doesn’t translate social situations, tools like “The Formalizer” help users convey their thoughts in the way they want it to come across to avoid miscommunication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FOGJCKCJ3JAZHL4RNCYD2YWEDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;AI tools are particularly popular among people on the autism spectrum because unlike humans, AI never gets tired of answering questions, De Buyser said in an interview. “They don’t tire, they don’t get frustrated, and they don’t judge the user for asking anything that a neurotypical might consider weird or out of place,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4C6C57GU6BEABNMIZTVGRISJBM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Lawrence Fung, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University, said the Autistic Translator can be a great tool to improve communication and articulate what is going on in their social settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UY4HVAG3QBEV3OUI7DAH4JX77M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I think that they can definitely learn from it,” Fung said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SEEAMNZW6NFR5NJOLSNREZ5DPE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However, autistic people don’t always get the whole picture and because the AI is reliant on the user’s understanding of the situation, it can result in inaccurate outputs, Fung said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VYBPQHL36ZCLJME62EKHMZY4CM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For 22-year-old Eva Dale,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;understanding the entire picture of certain social situations&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;can be a challenge. The bakery worker from Connecticut often finds that people say one thing when they really mean another. Deciphering what people mean isn’t intuitive for Dale, who has autism and relies on direct translations from her mom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZXEZPVMKO5HWZNNBDUUXTIHVBM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;During one instance, Dale’s grandmother mentioned multiple times that her dog needed to go out, meaning it needed to be walked, but Dale interpreted it literally to take the dog outside. Later, Dale’s mom explained that her grandmother was really asking her to walk the dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PBOMCKIALBHRDPV3RERO3S6ESE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“A lot of times, people say something like the dog has to go out, and it means a secret message like ‘Will you take the dog out?’ They won’t tell you the secret message and expect you to know it,” Dale said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HHYNSM6BW5A3JLJWKCV3DM3TKI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Skeptical, Dale entered the interaction into the Autistic Translator. To her surprise, she got the same response her mom had given her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X5C2MGA5U5E57CYSGBIPUS2HFY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I feel like the program understands at least somewhat the autistic brain in general. It’s actually very impressive that it can understand such a wide range of people,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DH4BYBSR7JAFTJWOQ2H5AQZH5M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However, not all users get direct answers. After coming across the Autistic Translator on Reddit, Phillip Lee, a 28-year-old from California, tested out the AI tool on multiple occasions but ultimately decided that he’d prefer to get feedback from the people around him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LDIFVVEYIZDG3EA62WML6BUCOQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Understanding tone, social cues and other nonverbal language has always been a challenge for Lee, who has autism and ADHD. He was reprimanded last year by his graduate program committee for delivering jokes at inappropriate times. He also heard from his peers and colleagues that his blunt tone and lack of eye contact came off as dismissive. Frustrated, Lee sought to better understand his cognitive difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BRUE512F2D3GV27Z9CNZY9F1Q8" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Asking the translator how people perceive his mannerisms helped Lee clarify some things, like when he asked the AI: “Why do people get mad when I don’t smile?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UJGPFF3WXZFI7LF4ZJ52IGLAEQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The translator responded, “Neurotypicals often rely on smiles as a nonverbal cue for friendliness, while this might not be a natural expression for autistics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5QVUM73DDBCBHNCAZVNNFQV4PE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This made sense to Lee. As he entered more specific scenarios from his personal life such as “Why do I get so angry?” the responses grew more vague and general, sometimes not even getting a response at all because of the complicated nature of the questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MZK5TPE4JJDD7FPBYE5ZNW5ZGA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Daniel says that users are given a disclaimer about the translator’s capabilities, and that people don’t have to agree with everything the AI tool says. The Autistic Translator is programmed to acknowledge and redirect any questions about complex topics like violence, drugs and medical advice and divert back to communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2IV26NHOW5CIFA3TOUG5ISUOWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Wary of the AI’s ability to factor in the context and dynamics of his life, Lee prefers to hear feedback directly from his colleagues and family now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RYWTEPPNV5ENTFS4UAIPORYWQQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s informational but not holistic enough to suffice as a solution for everything,” Lee said of the AI tool. “There is no road map nor a flowchart because the autistic experience is an individualized experience that requires so much time and patience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D3MLAXHDC5C57HVVZOO6JQTFTE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As for Pierce, the translator recently helped them navigate a tricky relationship question.

But if sleep continues to elude you, there's always the tried-and-true method: sleeping pills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are different prescription sleeping pills used to help a person relax and feel drowsy. The most common are benzodiazepines and antihistamines that promote signals telling your brain it's time to shut down for the night.

People were surveyed on their sleep quality, how long they slept and if they used sleeping pills. Medical tests ruled out any prior health conditions that could have also affected a person's risk of dying early. Based on their sleep schedule, people were divided into four categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;extremely short sleepers (slept less than 4 hours a night)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;short sleepers (slept 4-6 hours a night)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;medium sleepers (slept 6-8 hours a night)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;long sleepers (slept over 8 hours)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People who did not use sleeping pills and regularly slept 6 to 8 hours a night had the lowest mortality risk than people who slept less than 4 hours and over 8 hours. One interesting finding, however, was that people who also slept 6 to 8 hours a night but took sleeping pills had a 55% higher mortality risk than non-users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Our results are staggering to say the least. Many people rely on sleeping pills to help them sleep, so it’s a shock to find that taking them may more than double your mortality risk," says &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eck.org.tw/en/team/yu-sun/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Yu Sun, MD, Ph.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Yu Sun, MD, Ph.D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a researcher at En Chu Kong Hospital in Taiwan who led the study, in a press release.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The authors also observed that sleeping pill users have a shorter life expectancy than non-users. Men's life expectancy was 5.3 years shorter, and women's was 5.7 years shorter. Additionally, sleeping pill users had a higher cancer death rate than nonusers who slept 6 to 8 hours a night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1399416/kaitlin-vogel/chronic-insomnia-patient-journey/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What One Woman With Chronic Insomnia Does to Sleep Better;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;What One Woman With Chronic Insomnia Does to Sleep Better&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How Could Sleeping Pills Be Affecting Mortality Risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sleep scientists don't know for certain whether it's the sleeping pills that are causing the increased risk of death. &lt;a href="https://readyo2.com/meet-emma-lin/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Emma Lin, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Emma Lin, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a pulmonary and sleep medicine physician at ReadyO2, says people who need sleeping pills every night tend to have other health problems, including depression, anxiety or respiratory problems. All three are independently linked to poor health that may contribute to an early death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, if sleeping pills are really to blame, sleep doctors have some explanations for how this could be happening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, many sleeping pills are benzodiazepines (think Klonopin or Xanax), a type of medication that slows down activity in your brain. &lt;a href="https://sleeplessinarizona.com/ruchir-p-patel-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Ruchir Patel, MD, FACP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Ruchir Patel, MD, FACP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a sleep medicine physician and owner of The Insomnia and Sleep Institute of Arizona, says using benzodiazepines for a long time is linked to memory problems and decreased concentration. It may also start to change people's emotional states and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"These effects can indirectly contribute to increased mortality risk by affecting daily functioning and increasing the likelihood of accidents, especially in older adults," Dr. Patel explains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There has also been &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2773826" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; linking benzodiazepine use with an increase in mortality among people 65 or younger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People who use benzodiazepines in general also have 66% greater odds of ending up hospitalized or dying, Dr. Patel warns. "When benzodiazepines are combined with non-benzodiazepine receptor agonists, the odds of serious health outcomes nearly quadruple," he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/healthy-habit-thats-taking-years-102500219.html" data-ylk="slk:The 'Healthy' Habit That's Taking Years Off Your Life ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;The 'Healthy' Habit That's Taking Years Off Your Life &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Should You Stop Using Sleeping Pills?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the study results are concerning, there are some limitations to consider before flushing your pills. First, the authors were only observing people's behavior and how it may affect their mortality risk. The higher death rate could be from an unexplained illness, not the sleeping pills. Second, the study relied on people's recall of their nighttime habits, and memory of events can get fuzzy. Third, while questionnaires were filled out at every annual visit, only the results from the first visit were used in the calculations. It's possible that changes in sleep behavior and the use of sleeping pills changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Lin recommends talking with your doctor before you stop taking sleeping pills, explaining, "Stopping by yourself is risky. Certain sleep pills have to be tapered off, or your sleep will become worse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He adds that when working with patients, he tries to get to the root of what's causing the sleeplessness in the first place: "Is it stress? Is sleep apnea, in that they are not breathing at night? Do they have lung problems which cause them to have trouble breathing when they are in bed? If we know the cause, then we can treat the problem, not cover it up with a pill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/4-things-almost-everyone-lives-002500834.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: 4 Things Almost Everyone Who Lives to 100 Has In Common, According to Longevity Experts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: 4 Things Almost Everyone Who Lives to 100 Has In Common, According to Longevity Experts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 14:25:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPZ3hZc0gxRkhKS0JUTGFIUG1ITjFPeVpsZE04Vnl5cUZDRllsQ3BDZTMyRFI3R1pOeXhweC12V2NwcHFLUzNqUGZobnMwSlJsbVh1UHRlNDFmQldDc1VKZ2VaQ3dDUjJzNUhWRHZEUnRTNGtJTklyc25HNEd2bWlyeA</guid></item><item><title>我在52岁时超级健康，治愈了我的焦虑和抑郁-每日邮报 | I got super-fit at 52, cured my anxiety and depression - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxPNWxQcVE2X0RBNmhlU293RFd4QlllakMya1JtbjNJTnhlaS1KekVrZWxWM2Y2OWFpT3JVYkJuQjd2RjJGU2ZFeXd3TXgyUWswMlR3eUZqTG43aUQ4NDFLVzFlUnhQNDIxNWROa2dBZTB1RGdTVGRYNmYwZ2R6VC1USGVYel9OclBDWFd5QXhJT2RUX2lQVW5B?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the dead of night, Alison Weihe got out of her warm bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother-of-two tiptoed past her children's bedrooms to ensure she didn't disturb them and silently snuck into the kitchen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her stomach was rumbling.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier that evening, she'd barely touched the dinner she'd prepared for the family and instead kept herself busy cleaning and chatting while everyone else tucked in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm on a diet,' she told herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now, in the early hours of the morning, the then-40-year-old wrenched open the fridge door and began to stuff her face with food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was a pattern she knew only too well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To me food wasn't fuel, it was the enemy,' Alison, now 66, from Johannesburg, South Africa, tells Daily Mail Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In her 50s, Alison was still struggling with the disordered eating she'd been suffering with since she was just eight years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was constantly battling with food for decades. I wasn't overweight, but I wasn't slim either.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The battle began for Alison when she was just eight years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She felt like the 'odd one out' growing up in a sporty household and 'wanted to be invisible' because she felt different. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My siblings were always out playing sport whereas I was a very sensitive, quiet, and gentle,' she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as feeling isolated from her siblings, Alison had struggles with her parents. Her father was suffering with bipolar disorder, although there wasn't a name for the diagnosis at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He would have these manic ups and downs and drive away, tyres screeching into the night, saying he's going to commit suicide,' Alison says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I started emotional eating as a way of numbing myself. I was like an invisible child. It set in motion of pattern for the next 50 years.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alison's anxiety, depression and comfort eating followed her into her twenties - and only got worse when she began to attempt extreme diets to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alison now exercises regularly, running and doing Pilates. She eats a mostly vegetarian diet, consisting of lots of fruit, vegetables and eggs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;At 52, Alison hit 'rock bottom' after her business fell apart due to a fraud scandal where US$1.3million (AU$2million) was lost. The financial strain put pressure on her marriage too&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I was 24 I went to the doctor and started a radical extreme diet. I just wanted to be thin,' Alison says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She started following a very low calorie diet, weighing and measuring every ingredient, becoming completely obsessive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I tried so hard to maintain the weight and would take laxatives, I'd do anything to lower the needle on the scale,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This obsession developed into an eating disorder, where Alison would binge, then purge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alison's weight was up and down like a yo-yo and she spent years losing and gaining the same 30kg over and over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her disordered eating continued into her thirties and it became so overwhelming she contemplated suicide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I drove around the edge of the cliffs of Cape Town wanting to end it all,' she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thankfully, she didn't go through with it, and soon afterwards she met her husband, got married and started her own business.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But her battle with food continued even after having her two children, a son and a daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite thinking 'I need to stop this' over and over again, she simply couldn't. Her binging, purging and laxative abuse were having serious health implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In my forties I fainted and scraped my face against the wall,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My body was so dehydrated that I ended up in a hospital ward surrounded by sick people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But I wasn't sick, I had done it to myself. I looked in the mirror that day, shook my head and thought: "What am I doing to my children?"' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At 52, Alison hit 'rock bottom' after her business fell apart after losing US$1.3million (A$2million) to fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'After having built up this award-winning company, we crashed. We were literally on our knees. My husband and I had to rebuild from the ground up,' Alison says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The financial strain put pressure on her marriage and it was one of the most challenging situations Alison has ever been in both personally and professionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she was aware rebuilding her business could take years, Alison knew there was one thing she could take control of in that moment - her health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By then, she was going through menopause too - but rather than see it as a reason not to start, she began to view it like her failed business - as another challenge to overcome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As she struggled in other areas of her life, it was like something had finally clicked when it came to weight loss and health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I signed up with a personal trainer who was wonderful but for an entire year I felt like I was in victim mode. Then something started shifting and I joined a run club, then started swimming and doing yoga,' she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've been running for eight years now and the furthest I've ever run is 21km, which I only started doing in my fifties.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At 58 she made another promise to herself: she was going to stop stepping on the scales. Instead she was going to focus on how good it felt to fuel and move her body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she turned 60, Alison experienced a spiritual shift after attending a ten-day wellness retreat where she was 'forced to confront herself'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, six years later, Alison feels like she's ageing backwards and is on a mission to prove it's never too late to start. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She follows a mostly vegetarian-based diet full of fibrous vegetables, eggs, salads and smoothies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crucially, she practises intermittent fasting by not eating until 11am, a habit she credits with maintaining her weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Intermittent fasting was popularised by the late Dr Michael Mosley, who found it assisted weight management, enhanced metabolic health and reduced the risk of chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Now in her mid-60s, Alison feels like she's aging backwards and is on a mission to prove it's never too late to start (pictured with her husband of 31 years) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatLHS femail" data-version="2" id="mol-82af20d0-1b34-11f0-bd0a-11e57df6c2bc" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/real-life/article-14617095/Alison-Weihe-super-fit-66.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;Alison's 'day on a plate'&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alison follows the intermittent fasting eating pattern whereby she doesn't eat until 11am.

I'm sorry for the person I used to be,' it began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mother and daughter embraced and no other words were said.

Drawing on a large sample of students in New York City public schools, the study found that each standard deviation increase in height was associated with modestly higher scores in both English Language Arts and math across grades 3 through 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted this study to better understand why taller individuals often earn higher wages in adulthood, a pattern well-documented in prior research. One possible explanation is that taller individuals may have had academic advantages earlier in life, which could partly explain their later success in the labor market. While previous studies hinted at a link between height and early academic performance, this research aimed to examine that relationship more directly using a large, recent dataset from a major urban school district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a well-known result in the social sciences that taller men and women have higher earnings than shorter ones in countries all over the world,” said Stephanie Coffey, an assistant professor of economics at Saint Anselm College, who conducted the research along with Amy Ellen Schwartz of the University of Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research has offered a few possible explanations for the phenomenon. One explanation is social channels (i.e. taller people may be more self-confident, or may be perceived more positively by others). Another is that height is positively associated with ability (taller individuals tend to score higher on tests of cognitive ability than shorter ones). So, maybe it’s ability that is rewarded on the labor market, rather than height &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since academic achievement is an important determinant of eventual earnings, we were curious whether taller children might similarly perform better on state standardized tests during school. A great dataset from the New York City Department of Education that has annual measures of height and test scores for students enrolled in NYC public schools facilitated the analysis. A huge plus of these data is that they allow us to compare students directly to their peers within the same school.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dataset included longitudinal data from nearly 500,000 students enrolled in New York City public schools between 2010 and 2017. It contained detailed records of student height measurements, standardized test scores in math and English Language Arts, demographic characteristics, and other information such as obesity status and school attendance. Height was standardized relative to same-sex, same-grade peers within each school to capture a student’s height standing among classmates. The researchers then used regression models to examine how differences in height related to differences in test performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings showed a consistent, though small, association between height and academic achievement. Among boys, each one standard deviation increase in height was associated with a 0.03 standard deviation increase in math scores and a 0.039 standard deviation increase in English scores. Among girls, the corresponding increases were 0.034 and 0.04 standard deviations. Although these numbers may seem small, they add up over time. For instance, the tallest 2.5% of boys and girls in their grade performed around 0.18 to 0.19 standard deviations better in English compared to the shortest 2.5%, a difference that can be meaningful in large-scale educational assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our primary finding is that boys and girls who are taller than their grade mates score higher in math and English Language Arts in every grade between 3-8 (the years in which tests are administered),” Coffey told PsyPost. “The size of the effect is small on average, but large enough to yield substantial disparities in achievement between the tallest and shortest kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, after we control for some basic demographic characteristics, the tallest 2.5% of boys and girls score about 20% of one standard deviation higher in English Language arts than the shortest 2.5% of boys and girls in the same grade and school. An educational intervention is typically viewed as having a meaningful impact if it improves test scores by 10% of one standard deviation, so we consider this to be a pretty large effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study found that height relative to classmates, not just absolute height, also appeared to matter. Students who ranked higher in height compared to their peers tended to do slightly better in English, even after accounting for their actual height. This suggests that social perceptions tied to being taller than one’s peers might play a small role in academic performance, at least in language-related subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something else our data allow us explore whether it is simply being &lt;em&gt;tall&lt;/em&gt; that explains the effect, or being &lt;em&gt;taller&lt;/em&gt; than peers specifically,” Coffey explained. “We can tease this out because the distribution of height varies between schools, so a student may be relatively tall or short for his grade depending on the heights of his peers. Essentially, our estimates show that if you compare two students of the same height in the same grade (but at different schools) the student who attends a school where he is relatively tall compared to peers will score slightly higher in English Language Arts than the same-height student who attends a school where he is relatively short. This suggests that social benefits of height are at least part of the story.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An important part of the study was testing whether health could explain the relationship between height and achievement. Taller students might be healthier, and healthier students might perform better in school. To examine this possibility, the researchers controlled for obesity status and found that the relationship between height and achievement actually grew stronger after accounting for obesity. They also tested whether taller students were less likely to miss school, finding very little evidence that absenteeism played a meaningful role. This suggests that the observed height-achievement link is unlikely to be explained by better health among taller students alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address the possibility that family background or early childhood conditions might explain both greater height and better academic performance, the researchers estimated models that controlled for each student’s fixed characteristics over time. Once they accounted for these unchanging traits, the relationship between height and test scores weakened considerably, but still remained statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think what surprised us most was how robust the height achievement relationship is,” Coffey told PsyPost. “We find it in both math and English Language Arts achievement in every grade between 3-8 and for every racial/ethnic group we look at. Given social norms around height, we thought the ‘height premium’ might be larger for boys, but we found very similar effects for boys and girls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings are robust across multiple statistical models, the study does have limitations. The researchers could not directly measure early childhood conditions, such as prenatal health or family socioeconomic status during infancy, which likely contribute to both height and academic performance. Nor could they fully separate the effects of social treatment based on height from the effects of innate ability or other factors. Although the fixed-effects models help address some of these concerns, they cannot completely rule out all potential sources of bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main caveat is that we’re limited in our ability to uncover the underlying mechanisms that drive the academic height premium,” Coffey noted. “We looked at attendance and found that shorter kids really aren’t absent more frequently than taller ones, so we don’t think it’s about health. However, it’s difficult to untangle how much of the effect might arise through early childhood advantage (that leads kids to be tall and to do well in school) vs. any social benefits of height &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re interested in exploring, more generally, how physical characteristics shape the way kids experience school. One way we could extend our research on height is by looking into the NYC School Climate Survey, which asks students about how they perceive the school environment, teachers and peers. We’ve also discussed the possibility of conducting similar analyses looking at childhood obesity rather than height.

Using a patented immuno-infrared sensor (iRS) technology, they measured the misfolding of the alpha-synuclein (αSyn) protein, a key driver of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early diagnosis is crucial, as clinical symptoms usually appear only after severe and irreversible brain damage.

Moreover, diagnosis is difficult and often incorrect because the disease takes many forms and symptoms overlap with other disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109228"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-biomarkers-new-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Dopamine supplements can compensate for the loss and temporarily alleviate the symptoms. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the PRODI Center for Protein Diagnostics at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, and the biotech company betaSENSE have now discovered a biomarker in the spinal fluid that facilitates a reliable diagnosis at an early stage and can shed light on the progression of the disease and the effect of a therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They report their findings in the journal &lt;em&gt;EMBO Molecular Medicine on&lt;/em&gt; April 25, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parkinson’s disease – an unstoppable condition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic nerve cells in the brain, which usually leads to increasing motor impairments as the symptoms progress. Dopamine supplements can compensate for the loss and temporarily alleviate the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The misfolding of the key protein alpha-synuclein (αSyn) from α-helical structures to β-sheet-rich structures plays a crucial role in the development of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These misfoldings make the protein sticky, leading to the formation of larger complexes, so-called oligomers. The oligomers then produce long fibrillar filaments and cause the aggregation of these filaments into macroscopically large Lewy bodies in the brain,” explains Professor Klaus Gerwert, founding and managing director at PRODI and CEO of betaSENSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced platform technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In two independent clinical cohorts with a total of 134 participants, the Bochum-based researchers showed that, with a sensitivity and specificity of well over 90 percent, this misfolding of αSyn in body-fluids is a viable biomarker for the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted using cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients at the Parkinson’s centers in Bochum (St. Josef Hospital, Professor Lars Tönges, Professor Ralf Gold) and Kassel (Paracelsus-Elena-Klinik, Dr. Sandrina Weber, Professor Brit Mollenhauer).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measurements were carried out using the patented iRS (immuno-infrared sensor) technology from betaSENSE GmbH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;betaSENSE has already successfully implemented the iRS technology for diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. In this case, it was shown that the misfolding of the biomarker Aβ can indicate the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia at a later stage with high accuracy up to 17 years before clinical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have now transferred this approach to Parkinson’s for the misfolding of αSyn,” stresses Klaus Gerwert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development of Parkinson’s drugs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to diagnostic applications, the technology can also help to develop new active substances and prove their efficacy in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Parkinson’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b4dec1d8ddd59ac3d1ddd8d1c6f4c6c1d69ad0d1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Julia Weiler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://rub.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RUB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Julia Weiler – RUB&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s44321-025-00229-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alpha-synuclein Misfolding as Fluid Biomarker for Parkinson’s Disease Measured with the iRS Platform&lt;/a&gt;” by Klaus Gerwert et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;EMBO Molecular Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alpha-synuclein Misfolding as Fluid Biomarker for Parkinson’s Disease Measured with the iRS Platform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misfolding and aggregation of alpha-synuclein (αSyn) play a key role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Despite considerable advances in diagnostics, an early and differential diagnosis of PD still represents a major challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We innovated the immuno-infrared sensor (iRS) platform for measuring αSyn misfolding. We analyzed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from two cohorts comprising PD cases, atypical Parkinsonian disorders, and disease controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We obtained an AUC of 0.90 (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 134, 95% CI 0.85–0.96) for separating PD/MSA from controls by determination of the αSyn misfolding by iRS. Using two thresholds divided individuals as unaffected/affected by misfolding with an intermediate area in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparing the affected/unaffected cases, controls versus PD/MSA cases were classified with 97% sensitivity and 92% specificity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spectral data revealed misfolding from an α-helical/random-coil αSyn in controls to β-sheet enriched αSyn in PD and MSA cases. Moreover, a first subgroup analysis implied the potential for patient stratification in clinically overlapping cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The iRS, directly measuring all αSyn conformers, is complementary to the αSyn seed-amplification assays (SAAs), which however only amplify seeding competent conformers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 14:10:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5SM2hUcGczYlFWQTM1aTNfNEtzVGJoc3FjeXFHWjZFQ0sxUmgxVHJNNW1OM3NNQjFYYmpuQUREWWNWcm12M20weGRMdlUycXE2bVU5bW8zSk90bEtJYjJlcEJCM3lodTRTN2lzZzhwUmlOZk14</guid></item><item><title>根据专家的说法，如果你不吃早餐，你的身体会发生什么。- Stewartville Star | Here’s what happens to your body if you skip breakfast, according to an expert. - Stewartville Star</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxPQzE2TVdwa3B2NUY5VjlXZmpJa2V0cnM2dXVOUk9NQTBOTS1LTlVYZlJlOVRPakJYZ3lqNmtqM0xmWGJjeXFMWmN2Ul9hX090X1FzYmNSano5aGt2Uy1Jb0N3eHotSmdEai1ZTGM1Sk1aU1llMDB4ZlQxQmlRN0tza0dYSDVDZXhoSHBWWHdLcEZuUl82aDVtNVBuSTRYQmsxSTlnRWhlazFSenV1Nnk3RFZBdzNaRXZmOGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="text"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking the overnight fast with a morning meal has long been considered a nutritional cornerstone. Yet, millions regularly skip breakfast, either through habit or deliberate intermittent fasting practices. A nutrition expert has recently revealed surprising effects this common habit has on your body, challenging conventional wisdom about the “most important meal of the day.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-1"&gt;The surprising metabolic impact of skipping breakfast&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you finish your evening meal around 8 PM, your body begins a natural fasting period. By midnight, your blood sugar typically returns to normal levels. By 6 AM, after approximately ten hours without food, your digestive system has essentially reset itself. If you then continue to delay your first meal, your metabolism enters an interesting state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-in-text" id="think-2761774683"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The twelve-hour mark is when your body transitions to fat-burning mode,” explains dietitian Wintertok7, who has studied breakfast habits extensively. “Around 10 AM, this fat-burning process accelerates significantly, especially if you’ve incorporated morning exercise into your routine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/04/25/heres-the-actual-distance-you-should-walk-every-day-to-get-back-in-shape/"&gt;
                        &lt;span class="label dynamic"&gt;Well being&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Here’s the actual distance you should walk every day to get back in shape.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This metabolic shift represents the core benefit many intermittent fasting enthusiasts seek. By extending the overnight fast until midday, your body maintains this fat-burning state for longer periods. Breaking your fast around noon with a protein-rich meal that includes healthy fats and fiber helps maintain stable blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-adsense-2" id="think-1422578327"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that this approach may help avoid insulin spikes that typically follow carbohydrate-heavy breakfast options. For those working toward &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/02/01/doctor-reveals-five-hidden-effects-of-stopping-alcohol-for-30-days-has-on-the-brain/"&gt;specific health goals&lt;/a&gt;, this metabolic advantage could complement other healthy habits like reducing alcohol consumption.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-2"&gt;Energy regulation and cognitive function without morning meals&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Morning fasting creates distinct energy patterns throughout the day. Without the immediate glucose influx from breakfast, your body maintains more stable energy levels by drawing from fat stores. This can prevent the mid-morning energy crashes many experience after consuming sugar-laden breakfast options.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, cognitive function responses vary significantly between individuals. Some report enhanced mental clarity during extended morning fasts, while others experience concentration difficulties, irritability, or decreased productivity. These variations often relate to metabolic flexibility—how efficiently your body switches between glucose and fat for fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/04/15/heres-what-to-do-if-you-wake-up-in-the-middle-of-the-night-and-cant-get-back-to-sleep-according-to-this-expert/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Here’s what to do if you wake up in the middle of the night and can’t get back to sleep, according to this expert&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nutrition expert Nicci Roscoe notes, “While intermittent fasting works beautifully for some, others genuinely need that morning metabolic kickstart to function optimally.” Individual factors like sleep quality, stress levels, and activity demands all influence your morning nutritional needs.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those seeking to improve their mental resilience, breakfast timing may be worth examining. The relationship between nutritional habits and psychological fortitude is complex, as demonstrated in studies of &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/11/30/people-who-recover-quickly-failure-tend-display-these-8-traits/"&gt;traits associated with resilience&lt;/a&gt;. Your breakfast choices—or decision to skip—may influence how effectively you handle daily challenges.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-3"&gt;Who should reconsider the breakfast-skipping trend&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite potential benefits for some, breakfast remains crucial for specific populations. Growing children and adolescents typically require regular morning nutrition to support development and academic performance. Athletes with high energy demands often benefit from early fueling to optimize training quality and recovery.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with blood sugar regulation issues, including diabetes or hypoglycemia, should approach breakfast skipping cautiously. Similarly, those taking certain medications requiring food or experiencing certain digestive conditions may need consistent morning meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/04/05/after-knee-surgery-a-17yo-teenager-forgets-his-native-language/"&gt;
                        &lt;span class="label dynamic"&gt;Well being&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;After knee surgery, a 17yo teenager forgets his native language.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those juggling busy schedules, combining breakfast skipping with &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/05/is-walking-1-mile-per-day-enough-to-reap-health-benefits-experts-weigh-in/"&gt;simple exercise habits like daily walking&lt;/a&gt; may provide manageable health improvements. However, breakfast timing should complement rather than complicate your overall wellness approach.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People struggling with disordered eating patterns should be particularly mindful about meal timing strategies. What begins as intermittent fasting can sometimes reinforce problematic relationships with food. Working with nutrition professionals helps ensure fasting practices support rather than undermine health goals.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-4"&gt;Finding your optimal breakfast strategy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than viewing breakfast habits through a rigid lens, nutrition experts increasingly recommend personalized approaches based on individual responses. Self-experimentation with different meal timing patterns—while tracking energy, hunger, mood, and performance metrics—can reveal your optimal strategy.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you decide breakfast benefits you, prioritize protein-rich options while minimizing sugar and caffeine. This approach provides sustained energy without dramatic blood sugar fluctuations. For those who thrive without breakfast, ensuring adequate nutrition during eating windows becomes especially important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/04/04/how-long-should-you-walk-per-day-for-effective-weight-loss-a-fitness-coach-explains/"&gt;

                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developing self-awareness around hunger signals represents a crucial skill regardless of your breakfast preference. Learning to distinguish between habitual eating, emotional hunger, and true physiological need helps create sustainable nutrition patterns that &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/12/20/if-you-want-boost-your-confidence-say-goodbye-these-8-self-doubting-behaviors/"&gt;boost confidence in your health decisions&lt;/a&gt;.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that nutritional needs evolve with life circumstances. During particularly demanding periods, you might benefit from adjusting your breakfast approach. Remaining flexible rather than dogmatic allows for adaptation to changing requirements.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, protect your dietary choices from unnecessary social pressure.

More specifically, the study found that eating 150 grams or more of processed meat per week increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by 46% and the risk of early death by 50%, compared to eating no processed meat. The study authors also noted that processed meat consists of any type of meat that is “salted, cured, or treated with preservatives and/or food additives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While removing foods like processed meats from your diet (or limiting them) is a great way to stay healthy, keeping your heart health in check requires a multifaceted approach consisting of not only a healthy diet but also proper exercise and lifestyle choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for even more ways to protect your heart, try taking our &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a63743032/heart-health-quiz/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart health quiz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart health quiz&lt;/a&gt; to see how well you know the organ.
