                Phillipa Munari suffered nerve pain and exhaustion after she stopped taking antidepressants. She struggled to train her horse, Bella, and "could barely walk because of the withdrawal," said Munari. "I spent 20 hours in bed most days for two years."

   &lt;p&gt;Phillipa Munari started antidepressants in 2003. Her doctor recommended one, she said, after she complained of feeling tired. She didn't think it helped, but she kept taking it anyway. When she decided to stop taking the drug 10 years later, her doctor helped her taper off it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first, this went fine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"And then, six to nine months later, I started feeling horrible," she said. "I had nerve pain. My neck and shoulders were sore all the time. My anxiety was through the roof." These were symptoms Munari had never experienced before.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Munari, who lives in New Brunswick, Canada, said she became so exhausted and physically weak she found it difficult to continue her job at a call center. She spent much of the next two years in bed. To receive disability, she agreed to go back on the drug she'd been on, Effexor. She then weaned off it again, this time much more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The nerve pain and exhaustion gradually improved, she said, but the anxiety got worse.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I had complete panic. I couldn't leave the house," she said. Driving in the car, she said, "I'd be in the passenger seat with my eyes closed." It took two more years before things began to improve, she said in an interview as she choked up&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Munari is one of the tens of thousands of people who have turned to online forums to discuss lasting health problems after going off antidepressants. Many say their doctors didn't warn them this could happen, and didn't believe them when they said they were having a problem.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Doctors have long understood that stopping antidepressants can cause short-term withdrawal, with patients &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12602_discontinuation-symptoms-treatment-serotonin-reuptake.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;suffering from symptoms&lt;/a&gt; like dizziness, anxiety, insomnia and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What most prescribers and patients don't understand is that "you can have symptoms that persist for long periods after you stop them," said British psychiatrist Mark Horowitz, who specializes in antidepressant withdrawal. According to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489088/" target="_blank"&gt;one analysis&lt;/a&gt; of patient narratives, people who experienced long-term withdrawal suffered for an average of eight years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Although psychiatrists have been documenting cases like Munari's for decades, no large-scale studies on the problem exist. Because of that, experts still disagree on how common this kind of condition is, how to prevent it, or even what to call it.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It should be very concerning to the medical system and the public that there are tens of millions of people walking around on drugs whose long-term exposure and withdrawal effects we do not understand," Horowitz said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, survivors of antidepressant withdrawal and related conditions are coming together online and pushing for education, research and recognition. They say prescribers must inform themselves about these issues and warn patients about them before starting or keeping them on the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;'Before I took it, I had feelings'&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-76668" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                After spending 13 years on antidepressants, Sven Huber, from western Germany, had lasting problems after stopping the drugs.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Sven Huber found himself Googling depression symptoms in 2009 after reading media coverage of a German soccer player's suicide that November. The symptoms, he said, "fit on me."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huber, a 35-year-old living in western Germany, spent the next 13 years on antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His doctor first prescribed him one drug, which helped with his depression but made him sleepy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huber said he then switched to escitalopram (marketed as Lexapro), but that one was even worse. The day after he started it, Huber said, his genitals went numb and his emotions became blunted. He lost his libido, his vision went blurry, his feet felt like they were burning, and his cognition and short-term memory became unreliable, he said. "It felt like a switch was flipped," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huber's doctor recommended he wean off the medication over a few weeks. But immediately, Huber began experiencing sensations like electrical shocks in his head, known in psychiatry as "brain zaps." He grew anxious, confused, and had suicidal thoughts he'd never had before. All of these are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32259826/" target="_blank"&gt;documented symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of antidepressant withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you or someone you know is in crisis, contact the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://988lifeline.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;988 Suicide &amp;amp; Crisis Lifeline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; via call, text or chat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huber went back on the escitalopram. It seemed he had to choose: Endure extreme side effects or excruciating withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For nine years, Huber struggled to taper off the drugs, failing to quit them five times. Finally, a year and a half ago, he took his last dose.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The brain zaps, anxiety and suicidal thoughts all resolved, he said, but the blurry vision, burning feet, sexual dysfunction and emotional numbness persisted.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I can't relate to any family members or friends," he said. "Before I took it, I had feelings – bad feelings often – but I felt something. And now I do not feel anything at all."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This emptiness, he said, is the hardest to bear. "I would just like to feel like a human," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Side effects that may never go away&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lasting problems after withdrawal like Huber's probably occur very infrequently, estimates Nassir Ghaemi, a prominent psychiatrist and professor at Tufts University's School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I would say it's an unknown minority of patients who may have this kind of side effect long term," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But doctors who specialize in antidepressant withdrawal say the true risk of severe and lasting symptoms may be obscured by the fact that many patients try and fail to stop the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I've never seen anybody come off long-term Effexor or Cymbalta and not have years of trouble," said Horowitz, the British psychiatrist. While these two drugs are known to be harder to stop, Horowitz said he also frequently sees severe and lasting problems among patients coming off drugs with less risk for withdrawal, like fluoxetine (marketed as Prozac) and escitalopram.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For some people, Horowitz said, these symptoms only begin after stopping the drug, while for others, the symptoms begin like side effects during treatment and get worse after stopping.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While patients and researchers often refer to lasting symptoms as "protracted withdrawal," Horowitz and other specialists have suggested terms like "serotonin-induced neurological dysfunction" or "antidepressant withdrawal injury" as umbrella terms for the phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Horowitz's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178125001453?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; the longer someone stays on antidepressants, the more likely they are to suffer from severe and long-lasting conditions after stopping them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Ghaemi and Horowitz both said it's important for anyone considering it not to stop antidepressants cold turkey, but rather to carefully taper off of them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Antidepressants can be helpful for short-term relief, said Ghaemi. But for depression, they are most effective in the first six months of use, he said, and "shouldn't be given routinely for years and decades. I think that's where we're running into problems." For certain conditions, he adds, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, long-term use may be recommended.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Eli Lilly, which makes Cymbalta and Prozac, and AbbVie which makes Lexapro, declined to comment for this story. APM Reports and NPR could not reach Viatris, which makes Effexor for comment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;'That's historic'&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huber was relieved to learn he wasn't alone when he discovered online forums full of people with stories like his, he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSSD/" target="_blank"&gt;Reddit page&lt;/a&gt; geared specifically toward people with PSSD, or post-SSRI sexual dysfunction, people talk about having "genital anesthesia" and no libido while taking and after stopping antidepressants. Many also share the emotional numbness Huber described, saying they can no longer experience love, joy or pleasure, a phenomenon doctors call anhedonia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Reading these, "I knew I wasn't crazy," Huber said. But it was scary to learn how long people were suffering for, and that there wasn't a cure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That page has grown from 700 to 16,000 subscribers over the past five years. Other groups have grown too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A forum called &lt;a href="http://survivingantidepressants.org" target="_blank"&gt;Surviving Antidepressants&lt;/a&gt; has 23,000 members. A Facebook group that helps users taper off the antidepressant Cymbalta has 43,000 members.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Many more exist on different platforms, for specific drugs and in various languages.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While pharmaceutical companies have poured billions into efforts to show antidepressants work, relatively few studies have explored the drugs' negative effects.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Frustrated by the absence of research, advocates are lobbying governments and the medical establishment to fund studies that could reveal the conditions' prevalence, causes, and possible cures. Some patients are spending their own money on research.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The nonprofit PSSD Network has raised more than $200,000 for research over the past two years, which it directs to a research team at the University of Milan, in Italy. And in response to pressure from the Canadian PSSD Society, the Canadian government recently began funding research into PSSD through small grants through the University of British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's historic," Nick Alves, a spokesperson for the PSSD Network said&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;about this kind of institutional involvement. "That's huge."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another organization, the &lt;a href="https://antidepressantinfo.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Antidepressant Coalition for Education&lt;/a&gt;, is pushing people to report their withdrawal experiences to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-76669" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                After experiencing seven years of withdrawal symptoms from Paxil, Adele Framer started an online community forum in 2011.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;'People don't learn this stuff in medical school'&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Adele Framer started the online forum Surviving Antidepressants in 2011, following seven years of withdrawal symptoms after quitting an antidepressant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the website, volunteer moderators share best practices for tapering, often referring to a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Maudsley-Guidelines-prescribing-Prescribing/dp/111982298X" target="_blank"&gt;handbook&lt;/a&gt; for doctors written by Horowitz, the British psychiatrist. His method of reducing one's dose gradually – by 10% of the previous dose each month over a year or more, for example – differs dramatically from the standard medical guidance of tapering over a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Framer has worked with researchers to extract patient narratives from the forum into data that can be analyzed. This data has been used in many published studies. For example, one sought to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489088/" target="_blank"&gt;establish the duration&lt;/a&gt; and common symptoms of protracted withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's a hidden public health problem in people experiencing withdrawal symptoms because they and their doctors don't know how to gradually reduce the dosage," she said, and "people don't learn this stuff in medical school."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Recently, Framer has turned her attention to a new endeavor: a nonprofit called the Psychotropic Deprescribing Council, which she founded in 2023. The council's goals are to develop best practices for tapering off psychotropic medications to minimize risk of withdrawal symptoms and relapse, and to inform clinicians about them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And now, the influential American Psychiatric Association appears to be paying attention. Dr. Alan Schatzberg, a Stanford psychiatrist and consultant to the APA, said he thinks depression is worse than withdrawal symptoms, and warned "we would not want people not to take the medications."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But because the group received complaints about PSSD from patients, he said, the APA's research council has begun to review the literature on PSSD and other lasting problems from antidepressants. It will publish the results.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Horowitz, the British psychiatrist, said he welcomes the APA's interest, but a review of the literature will likely be inadequate. "When you do a review, you're only reviewing what exists," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;existing studies on modern antidepressants, known as SSRIs and SNRIs, weren't designed to assess withdrawal or long-term use.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Horowitz said he'd like to see government-funded research that follows long-term antidepressant users' experiences after they stop the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Whether this is likely in the U.S. is uncertain. On the one hand, Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is an outspoken critic of antidepressants. On the other hand, the Trump administration has cut federal funding for biomedical research as well as &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/06/nx-s1-5424670/rfk-jr-samhsa-mental-health-addiction-overdose-trump-budget-cuts" target="_blank"&gt;staffing at federal health agencies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Horowitz said he believes the APA's literature review is a sign patients and advocates are being heard. "It means that pressure has got somewhere."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was produced by&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apmreports.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt; APM Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the investigative reporting unit at American Public Media.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Recent research reveals nuanced answers based on age, health status, and goals like weight loss or brain health. Latest data shows moderate egg intake can boost longevity in older adults, support cognition, and maintain cholesterol balance, while overdoing it might tip the scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this guide, we’ll dive deep into cutting-edge findings, expert recommendations, and creative ways to enjoy eggs without cracking your health. Let’s get cracking!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eggs: What's inside that shell?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are nutrient powerhouses. One large egg delivers about 6–7 g of protein, all nine essential amino acids, and rich vitamins A, D, E, and B12, along with choline, lutein, zeaxanthin, and unsaturated fats. The yolk is the star for brain and eye health; whites offer pure, cholesterol-free protein. Perfect fuel for muscles, minds, and overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the recent research say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study featured in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/fo/d3fo04248k/unauth" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Food &amp;amp; Function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; has provided new insights into how egg intake relates to overall health. The research tracked nearly 19,000 adults and revealed that those who consumed around 1.5 eggs daily exhibited markedly stronger bones compared to individuals who completely avoided eggs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, participants who regularly included eggs in their diet displayed a 72% increase in bone density at the femur and an 83% increase in bone density at the spine. These results challenge earlier beliefs about the dangers of egg consumption and underscore their potential benefits for bone health, especially in adults prone to osteoporosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusions of the study imply that eggs may offer more health benefits beyond just being a source of high-quality protein. The bone-supporting features of eggs are significant, with the study indicating that consistent consumption of this food could positively impact skeletal integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eggs: The benefits in the basket&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are one of nature’s most extraordinary foods – compact nutritional powerhouses that effortlessly combine taste, convenience, and versatility. Thanks to vitamins, minerals, high-quality protein, and brain-boosting choline, eggs support everything from muscle repair to vision and immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nutrient-density unmatched&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are often called “nature’s multivitamin” – and for good reason. A single large egg (≈70–80 kcal) delivers ~6 g high-quality protein (all 9 essential amino acids), significant choline (~113–147 mg), vitamins A, D, E, B12, riboflavin, folate, riboflavin, selenium, zinc, iron, lutein and zeaxanthin, and healthy fats. The yolk supplies most nutrients and fat; whites contribute lean protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Protein perfection and weight management&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a “biological value” benchmark score of 100 (perfect protein source), eggs support lean muscle repair and metabolic health. Studies show egg-based breakfasts curb appetite, stabilize blood sugar, and help reduce calorie intake later in the day – leading to greater weight loss compared to carb-heavy breakfasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brain and mental boosters&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egg yolks are among the richest dietary sources of choline, vital for neurotransmitter synthesis and cell membrane structure. Pregnant women particularly benefit, with choline supporting fetal brain development. In older adults, choline supports memory and cognitive function-evidenced by reduced Alzheimer’s risk among regular egg consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eye protection powerhouses&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egg yolks contain lutein and zeaxanthin, antioxidants that concentrate in the retina, shielding eyes from blue light and oxidative damage. Daily intake raises blood levels of these pigments by over 100%, reducing the risks of macular degeneration and cataracts. They’re also rich in vitamin A, essential for vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Heart Health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs once faced backlash due to yolk cholesterol (~186–200 mg per egg).

Recent research reveals nuanced answers based on age, health status, and goals like weight loss or brain health. Latest data shows moderate egg intake can boost longevity in older adults, support cognition, and maintain cholesterol balance, while overdoing it might tip the scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this guide, we’ll dive deep into cutting-edge findings, expert recommendations, and creative ways to enjoy eggs without cracking your health. Let’s get cracking!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Eating an egg a day: Is it good or bad for your heart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eggs: What's inside that shell?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are nutrient powerhouses. One large egg delivers about 6–7 g of protein, all nine essential amino acids, and rich vitamins A, D, E, and B12, along with choline, lutein, zeaxanthin, and unsaturated fats. The yolk is the star for brain and eye health; whites offer pure, cholesterol-free protein. Perfect fuel for muscles, minds, and overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you think eggs should be a regular part of everyone's diet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the recent research say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study featured in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/fo/d3fo04248k/unauth" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Food &amp;amp; Function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; has provided new insights into how egg intake relates to overall health. The research tracked nearly 19,000 adults and revealed that those who consumed around 1.5 eggs daily exhibited markedly stronger bones compared to individuals who completely avoided eggs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, participants who regularly included eggs in their diet displayed a 72% increase in bone density at the femur and an 83% increase in bone density at the spine. These results challenge earlier beliefs about the dangers of egg consumption and underscore their potential benefits for bone health, especially in adults prone to osteoporosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusions of the study imply that eggs may offer more health benefits beyond just being a source of high-quality protein. The bone-supporting features of eggs are significant, with the study indicating that consistent consumption of this food could positively impact skeletal integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eggs: The benefits in the basket&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are one of nature’s most extraordinary foods – compact nutritional powerhouses that effortlessly combine taste, convenience, and versatility. Thanks to vitamins, minerals, high-quality protein, and brain-boosting choline, eggs support everything from muscle repair to vision and immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nutrient-density unmatched&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are often called “nature’s multivitamin” – and for good reason. A single large egg (≈70–80 kcal) delivers ~6 g high-quality protein (all 9 essential amino acids), significant choline (~113–147 mg), vitamins A, D, E, B12, riboflavin, folate, riboflavin, selenium, zinc, iron, lutein and zeaxanthin, and healthy fats. The yolk supplies most nutrients and fat; whites contribute lean protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Protein perfection and weight management&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a “biological value” benchmark score of 100 (perfect protein source), eggs support lean muscle repair and metabolic health. Studies show egg-based breakfasts curb appetite, stabilize blood sugar, and help reduce calorie intake later in the day – leading to greater weight loss compared to carb-heavy breakfasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brain and mental boosters&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egg yolks are among the richest dietary sources of choline, vital for neurotransmitter synthesis and cell membrane structure. Pregnant women particularly benefit, with choline supporting fetal brain development. In older adults, choline supports memory and cognitive function-evidenced by reduced Alzheimer’s risk among regular egg consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eye protection powerhouses&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egg yolks contain lutein and zeaxanthin, antioxidants that concentrate in the retina, shielding eyes from blue light and oxidative damage. Daily intake raises blood levels of these pigments by over 100%, reducing the risks of macular degeneration and cataracts. They’re also rich in vitamin A, essential for vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Heart Health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs once faced backlash due to yolk cholesterol (~186–200 mg per egg). In fact, a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/how-many-eggs-can-i-safely-eat" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Harvard study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; showed dietary cholesterol raises LDL (“bad”) cholesterol less than saturated fat, and most people can safely enjoy up to 7 eggs per week – which implies only one egg a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, research shows dietary cholesterol has less impact on blood cholesterol than saturated fat.

Well, that depends on your personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My personality is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“enjoys cake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;”.&lt;/strong&gt; That doesn’t sound very scientifically thorough, but it’s a start. Do you enjoy exercise?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the basis that I’m not a masochist, no, of course not.&lt;/strong&gt; Interesting. And why is that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, what if I’m at the gym and all the big men look at me?&lt;/strong&gt; In that case I have good news and bad news. The good news is that you fit an established archetype. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250708045648.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; has determined that people with higher levels of neuroticism are less likely to exercise regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me more about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; University College London invited 132 volunteers to follow an eight-week exercise course, with questionnaires to fill in about their enjoyment levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who doesn’t love&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; a sweaty questionnaire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt; After that, they had their personalities assessed to see if they generally exhibited signs of extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism or openness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And all the neurotics hated the exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt; Kind of. All the neurotics felt shy about exercising in front of other people, and preferred to do light workouts in short bursts away from everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the others? &lt;/strong&gt;Those who scored highly in extroversion loved high-intensity training such as weightlifting or spin classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, a scientific explanation for why spin classes are so obnoxious.&lt;/strong&gt; However, they didn’t have the best overall fitness. That went to those who scored highly in conscientiousness, because they possessed a better understanding of the long-term benefits of regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aside from underlining how awful extroverts are, what’s the point of all this? &lt;/strong&gt;Well, it’s understood that exercise is good for you. But perhaps the reason why people don’t do it is because they’re picking the wrong exercise for their personality type. When was the last time you went to the gym?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Several years ago. There were lots of big men, and potentially some of them were aware of my existence.&lt;/strong&gt; So that isn’t the right exercise type for your personality. What if you bought some resistance bands and worked out at home every morning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, maybe I’d&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; stick to that.&lt;/strong&gt; There we go. And you should, especially if you consider yourself neurotic. The study showed that, of all the five main personality types, neurotics were the only group who experienced a significant reduction of stress after exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So exercise might make me less neurotic?&lt;/strong&gt; It’s certainly a possibility. And who knows, if you really start enjoying it, you might even become a little bit of an extrovert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m going back to bed.&lt;/strong&gt; I suppose that’s understandable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do say:&lt;/strong&gt; “I should pick a workout that matches my personality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t say: &lt;/strong&gt;“I hear that cowering at the state of the world burns a ton of calories.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxOME54LTE0eTQwVXYtRWlpemtEbU1jZTk4STVZX0xpYnlhajFJN3RqQnRpaXNBbkVaTG13Nmkxd2JPWGE1QnNWdk94ZGxGc0xxRnFiZklmdGxTbjRHV1I4OG9LVzRDcHlLa0twOTJHaUdwRkNtQ1FYOV8wTXRwQzFYLUNIX3JSLXA3dmRkTTRhcWtpSXRDcmM0bUdwVlRFTXAwODhkRnN6TzUycmdXWF9TNU9mQVRMZHFGeXFfYVV6ZVl1UQ</guid></item><item><title>根据医生的说法，每天一杯葡萄酒如何影响你的心脏- Earth.com | How a glass of wine a day affects your heart, according to doctors - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxOeURwODVZT0JLbFB6UXFDYzBoNXNsRU9uWXNWWE0xQ2dXSldCai0wOHR1NVQtblBLUUdkeDhpUjRUYVNPTzBWbzFETVRqeDB6eE5EN3QyTUctbmQ4ZmduT1k5WEthREJsNklOMlo4YVFyeWNSNXg3NmthYVdoR2l2MjF1cVNkaUZaMTZzX2JEZHFFbjZoanlyVA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people toast the end of the day with a five‑ounce glass of wine, hoping that ritual keeps heart trouble at bay. Two new analyses suggest the habit might offer real – if limited – protection for adults already at higher risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest evidence comes from a Spanish arm of the long‑running &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28684083/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PREDIMED trial&lt;/a&gt;. The study tracked 1,232 older adults following a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; and found that those who averaged roughly half to one glass per day had significantly lower heart risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After five years, their risk of heart attack, stroke, or cardiac death dropped by nearly half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers verified intake by measuring wine‑derived tartaric acid in urine instead of relying on memory, a switch that turned vague drink logs into hard numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by &lt;a href="https://www.clinicbarcelona.org/en/professionals/ramon-estruch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Ramon Estruch&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://web.ub.edu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.clinicbarcelona.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hospital Clinic Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chemical-reveals-true-wine-intake"&gt;Chemical reveals true wine intake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questionnaires often miss what people actually pour, so scientists struggle to pin down alcohol’s true effects. Using the &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2311-7524/9/11/1173" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;grape‑exclusive metabolite tartaric acid&lt;/a&gt; makes it possible to see how much wine someone enjoyed over the previous week without asking them to confess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By measuring tartaric acid in the urine, alongside food and drink questionnaires, we have been able to make a more accurate measurement of wine consumption,” said Estruch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study linked tartaric acid levels to self-reported wine intake, confirming it as a reliable consumption marker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wine-s-effects-in-mediterranean-diets"&gt;Wine’s effects in Mediterranean diets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopting such objective tools may help resolve decades of conflicting findings that swing from “red wine is medicine” to “no amount is safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators also adjusted for smoking, exercise, and other &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/to-get-fit-and-stay-healthy-walk-this-exact-distance-every-day/"&gt;lifestyle habits&lt;/a&gt;, so the reduced risk cannot be written off as a simple marker of healthier living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, tartaric acid only captures wine, not beer or spirits, letting researchers isolate how fermented &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hidden-chemistry-of-wine-what-actually-shapes-its-texture/"&gt;grape products&lt;/a&gt; behave inside a diet already rich in extra‑virgin olive oil, fish, and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That context matters because many of wine’s plant compounds appear to interact with the broader Mediterranean plate, enhancing their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/healing-chronic-wounds-with-gold-and-red-wine/"&gt;antioxidant reach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-benefits-tied-to-small-servings"&gt;Benefits tied to small servings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who logged between three and thirty‑five five‑ounce glasses a month, roughly half to one serving a day, saw their risk of a major cardiac event fall by 50 percent. Light users who stayed below half a glass a day gained a 38 percent cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once intake climbed above one glass each day, the advantage disappeared and, in some analyses, reversed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pattern mirrors American Heart Association &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt;, which caps daily wine at one five‑ounce serving for women and two for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men, who made up just under half the study group, appeared to draw a stronger benefit. However, statisticians caution that the sex difference may fade in larger samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even within the favorable range, nurses warned that pouring size matters because many home glasses hold eight or nine ounces, inadvertently nudging people past the safer ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-makes-wine-different"&gt;What makes wine different&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wine carries a mix of polyphenols such as resveratrol, quercetin, and catechins that seem to boost the lining of blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34119624/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; report that supplemental resveratrol can improve endothelial function, a key factor in healthy blood pressure and clot prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red wine has more antioxidants due to skin fermentation, though white wine still provides some. That biochemical cocktail may partly explain why studies often find beer or spirits lack the same signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate alcohol itself can raise high-density lipoprotein (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cholesterol/about/ldl-and-hdl-cholesterol-and-triglycerides.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HDL&lt;/a&gt;), the so‑called “good” cholesterol, yet ethanol also raises triglycerides and blood pressure at larger doses. Polyphenols may tilt the equation back toward benefit, but only within a narrow window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-too-much-wine-harms-the-heart"&gt;Too much wine harms the heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 systematic &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2802963" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; that pooled data from 4.8 million people found no reduction in all‑cause mortality among moderate drinkers once misclassified former drinkers were excluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors warned that earlier optimism probably stemmed from comparing social drinkers with people who quit because of illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy pouring is indisputably harmful. Even &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2023/07/31/even-just-1-alcoholic-drink-a-day-may-increase-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;one extra daily drink&lt;/a&gt; can raise systolic blood pressure by two to four millimeters of mercury, a change large enough to push many people into hypertension. Elevated pressure strains arteries, sets the stage for arrhythmias, and accelerates heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://alcoholresearchforum.org/members/giovanni-de-gaetano/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Giovanni de Gaetano&lt;/a&gt; noted that the biomarker approach “provides robust evidence that moderate wine consumption is associated with lower CVD risk. He cautioned that the same data “remind us of the risks associated with higher levels of consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol also carries addictive potential, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that roughly &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/media/releases/2014/p0626-excessive-drinking.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;one in ten deaths&lt;/a&gt; among working‑age adults is tied to excessive drinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sobering statistic explains why public health agencies repeat that zero is the only completely risk‑free dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wine-humans-and-heart-health"&gt;Wine, humans, and heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For adults older than about 35 who already follow a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/16037-mediterranean-diet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, a small glass of wine with supper may fit comfortably into a heart‑conscious lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are pregnant, taking interacting medications, or battling addiction should not take the PREDIMED results as a green light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrients that give wine its appeal, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/moderate-wine-consumption-reduces-cardiovascular-risks/"&gt;including resveratrol&lt;/a&gt;, also reside in grapes, blueberries, nuts, and olive oil. Anyone who chooses to skip alcohol can still obtain similar antioxidant support without ethanol’s downsides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians emphasize that no one should start drinking for health reasons. Instead, the sensible takeaway is that very modest wine, enjoyed with meals and within established limits, is unlikely to harm. It might even help certain high‑risk adults when paired with vegetables, fish, and extra‑virgin olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/46/2/161/7920812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 00:14:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOeURwODVZT0JLbFB6UXFDYzBoNXNsRU9uWXNWWE0xQ2dXSldCai0wOHR1NVQtblBLUUdkeDhpUjRUYVNPTzBWbzFETVRqeDB6eE5EN3QyTUctbmQ4ZmduT1k5WEthREJsNklOMlo4YVFyeWNSNXg3NmthYVdoR2l2MjF1cVNkaUZaMTZzX2JEZHFFbjZoanlyVA</guid></item><item><title>“老年人气味”、肺癌风险和早晨锻炼警告-福克斯新闻 | 'Old people smell,' lung cancer risks and morning workout warnings - Fox News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQdXBHdEJoNW12bjYwcVVCaU9qYkpDZ25aU0x3WUFaWVBmeEZKSHlqemhheFNwTVljTHFJRVlQaXJBNmRwRjl2ZVB4QVR4U19kQ2dSTklsVHFqZmc5M3cwckM3X0NETWg1eEY5NUsyblYzT19rdUVENW9td25yeDB2NDRsbjA5dzNEb1ZQeXp3bGlPc21z0gGaAUFVX3lxTFBCLS1jTHRrV1lpTGRZMEhoSC0yOVU2NmF1a2JrVjc1YUZsaDk5X0hNUGxUbEx0SnNjSjFSYzdkTXFSaUpveXNIRjlENFpGV0o4WTFaYjVjVkk2NW1iV0NYQjB0QldjMDcxcmNjVlBPUHBSWkdXN1lWdllnbjJWN3ZrcGZvQ0xJelVKNVRFNWRWYmE5NEdtblYwcVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fox News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 23:43:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQdXBHdEJoNW12bjYwcVVCaU9qYkpDZ25aU0x3WUFaWVBmeEZKSHlqemhheFNwTVljTHFJRVlQaXJBNmRwRjl2ZVB4QVR4U19kQ2dSTklsVHFqZmc5M3cwckM3X0NETWg1eEY5NUsyblYzT19rdUVENW9td25yeDB2NDRsbjA5dzNEb1ZQeXp3bGlPc21z0gGaAUFVX3lxTFBCLS1jTHRrV1lpTGRZMEhoSC0yOVU2NmF1a2JrVjc1YUZsaDk5X0hNUGxUbEx0SnNjSjFSYzdkTXFSaUpveXNIRjlENFpGV0o4WTFaYjVjVkk2NW1iV0NYQjB0QldjMDcxcmNjVlBPUHBSWkdXN1lWdllnbjJWN3ZrcGZvQ0xJelVKNVRFNWRWYmE5NEdtblYwcVE</guid></item><item><title>根据一项新的研究- EatingWell ，如果您患有糖尿病，您应该摄入的被低估的蛋白质 | The Underrated Proteins You Should Be Eating If You Have Diabetes, According to a New Study - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTFA3dDQ0azh6a1A4alhFUlJVdkdzY24xa1VMR05MdHJCT1E2Y0VoOXdpY19VOEpOYmN1LTBXT2gtNHJHcUdtZVROalY4MTRXRUJiMHlwMklGREtnc3dSeURRZDZvZlhCRGQwR0NXNmdRVnRqbms?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Higher protein intake—especially leucine and lysine—was linked to lower DKD risk in diabetics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both animal and plant foods offer protective amino acids; variety is key for kidney health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plant-based proteins with fiber may support blood sugar control and overall kidney function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Type 2 diabetes is on the rise, and with it, associated complications, like diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Diabetic kidney disease is the primary cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a leading contributor to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/american-heart-association-redefined-heart-disease-risk-2023-8356291" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chronic kidney disease also raises your risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have diabetes, you know that protein is essential to help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-stable-blood-sugar-11758681" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stabilize your blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;.

Plant protein, however, has been shown to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-and-worst-foods-for-kidneys-11762971" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;prevent or slow down kidney function decline&lt;/a&gt;. With that said, the evidence is inconclusive, and the 2022 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative states that there is not enough conclusive evidence to recommend one type of protein over another.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this reason, the Initiative lumps all types together and recommends that people with diabetes or kidney disease who are not on dialysis restrict their protein intake to 0.8 g/kg of ideal body weight per day. This is also a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290496/this-is-how-much-protein-you-need-to-eat-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;general recommendation&lt;/a&gt; for people without diabetes, though that recommendation may be too low for some people.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers from Taiwan wanted to take a closer look at &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-protein-and-its-benefits-11732679" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;proteins and amino acids&lt;/a&gt;—the building blocks of protein— and their associations with diabetic kidney disease. They published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers recruited 378 participants with type 2 diabetes; half were women with an average age of 63. Based on urine tests, participants were split into two groups: those with just diabetes and those with diabetic kidney disease. Of the 378 participants, 237 were categorized as having diabetes without kidney disease, and 141 met the criteria for kidney disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Through structured interviews with registered dietitians, participants completed 24-hour dietary recalls and food frequency questionnaires at baseline. From their responses, protein amount and types were calculated. They were then placed into one of three categories based on their protein consumption: less than 0.8 grams per kilogram of ideal body weight (Group 1),&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;0.9-1.2 g/kg (Group 2) and more than 1.3 g/kg (Group 3). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Also at baseline, demographics like age, sex, diabetes duration and medication use were captured, along with BMI and waist circumference. Blood pressure was measured, and bloodwork was done for fasting glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and microalbuminuria. Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), both screenings for kidney disease, were calculated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Group 1, which had the lowest overall protein intake, also had the lowest mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (78), followed by Group 2 (85) and Group 3 (87). Typically, a normal eGFR is 90 or higher, and 89 to 60 indicates mild loss of kidney function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Group 1’s serum creatinine levels also suggested lower renal (kidney) function; they also had the highest fasting blood glucose levels, HbA1c (an average of blood glucose over three months) and microalbumin levels (UACR). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers then broke down types of protein into &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/should-you-be-taking-an-essential-amino-acid-supplement-11715877" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;amino acids&lt;/a&gt;. Amino acids are what proteins are made of. There are 20 primary amino acids necessary for humans, nine of which are essential amino acids. They’re essential because we need to get them from food, as our bodies cannot make them.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What surfaced after statistical analyses were run was that higher overall protein intake, as well as higher intake of certain amino acids—branched-chain (BCAA), aromatic (AAA) and ketogenic amino acids—were all independently associated with a lower risk of diabetic kidney disease. In particular, leucine and lysine, two essential amino acids, were most strongly associated with a lower risk of diabetic kidney disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers concluded that for non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease patients, in addition to the recommended total protein intake, the balance of amino acid patterns should be considered. They suggest that supplementation with branched-chain amino acids and histidine, and restriction of tyrosine, methionine and glutamic acid—all amino acids found in higher concentrations in meat—may serve as nutritional strategies to support kidney function.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Study authors note that their findings align with previous studies, suggesting that ketogenic amino acids, in particular, leucine and lysine, may help protect against diabetic kidney disease. While found in many foods, leucine and lysine are abundant in:

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As you can see, it’s a nice mix of animal and plant proteins that contain these essential amino acids. Whether you have diabetes or not, it’s important to include a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-protein-vegetarian-foods-11762306" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;variety of protein-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-protein-benefits-11712145" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;plant proteins&lt;/a&gt; are definitely worth prioritizing, as they often include &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044305/best-high-fiber-vegetables/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;fiber and healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have diabetes and struggle with maintaining healthy blood sugar levels, consider how much protein you’re eating.

Many sources of plant protein will offer both of those nutrients. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/misconception-about-protein-survey-11701426" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Combining animal proteins with a plant source&lt;/a&gt; is another great way to get protein and fiber into your day. For example, yogurt with fruit and nuts or tuna with veggies are filling, tasty options.

Pushpa Narayan speaks to Dr Vijay Viswanathan, president of the Research Society for the Study of Diabetes in India (RSSDI), about how these wearables are helping in diabetes management. Take a look...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How good are CGMs at monitoring blood sugar levels?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These wearables give real-time information about glucose levels, providing greater insight into the body’s sugar trends than traditional finger-prick tests. CGMs can show how different foods, exercise, sleep, and stress impact a person’s glucose levels 24x7. This data helps doctors offer dietary and medicinal adjustments to optimise blood sugar levels. Some studies suggest CGMs can detect early signs of impaired glucose tolerance or prediabetes even in those with normal HbA1c (2-3 month blood sugar average) levels. Also, the feedback can motivate people with diabetes to adopt healthier lifestyle choices such as regular physical activity and balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Did You Know? Mangoes Are Low On Calories And Supports Heart Health!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When do you recommend them?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In specific cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, I had a patient whose HbA1c was 6.1, which is very good control for a person with diabetes, but the fasting and postprandial (after a meal) sugar levels were extremely high. We found it was possibly because my patient had been eating mangoes almost every day. HbA1c is the gold standard but doesn’t reveal glucose fluctuations that occur throughout the day. A normal HbA1c with frequent low and high blood sugar indicates wide swings that the average doesn’t capture. A high HbA1c despite ‘good’ clinic readings could mean post-meal spikes or overnight high sugar that are not being captured by intermittent testing. We recommend a CGM when a patient’s average might be masking significant glycemic variability. It provides the timing, magnitude, and frequency of fluctuations, allowing doctors to pinpoint the root cause of disparity and adjust meal plans and medical treatment accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are they tools to improve diagnosis?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. For instance, the Somogyi phenomenon or rebound hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) and the Dawn phenomenon are two distinct causes of high morning blood sugar in people with diabetes. Somogyi phenomenon occurs when an episode of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) during the night triggers the release of counter-regulatory hormones such as glucagon, cortisol, and epinephrine which work to raise blood sugar. In diabetics who lack sufficient insulin, this mechanism can overshoot, leading to high blood sugar levels in the morning. Dawn phenomenon is a more natural process where the hormones cause a blood sugar rise between 2am and 8am to prepare for waking. These hormones increase insulin resistance and signal the liver to produce more glucose. In those without diabetes, the pancreas releases enough insulin but not in diabetics, leading to elevated blood sugar levels upon waking. Unlike Somogyi phenomenon, Dawn phenomenon is not preceded by a hypoglycemic event. It’s important to distinguish between the two as treatment varies. CGMs help the caregiver diagnose, adjust insulin dosage and medication timing, with better long-term health outcomes and lower risk of complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="_oWMq   "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information overload can cause anxiety, unwarranted dietary restrictions, and sometimes an unhealthy obsession with food among healthy folk. Not to mention needless expense&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="DuPus"&gt;Dr Viswanathan&lt;small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Even healthy people are using CGMs as a predictive health tool to prevent diabetes. Would you recommend it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors’ bodies, including RSSDI, are cautious about recommending widespread use in healthy people as the need is not yet proven. Also, most devices have algorithms tailored only to a diabetic’s needs, which can lead to data misinterpretation. There’s also the danger of an information overload that can cause anxiety, unwarranted dietary restrictions, and sometimes an unhealthy obsession with eating among healthy folk. Not to mention the needless spending. That said, manufacturers have designed over-the-counter devices for those who don’t use insulin and are not at severe risk of low blood sugar. For healthy people, I would recommend a balanced diet, exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight for glucose management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can CGMs help kids and the elderly?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They greatly reduce the need for painful finger-prick tests that kids may dislike and the elderly may have difficulty with. Both may be more susceptible to hypoglycemia and may not experience typical symptoms. A CGM can provide life-saving alerts for low glucose that would help prevent severe episodes. And modern CGMs are often user-friendly, which can benefit older adults with cognitive impairments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-gFBVV95cUxQRXZzQUhZRzJrV2JuN2pPampMVEljSENiU2UzNFd5NWhBNWloWGZ3YkhnYTZyak96VDhHYnhSeU5yNFVqRTNnek5uOWtjUmhDdUt1WEZpdzVSVlp1bmxYcGpuQ0dEblh6Zkw5bkJPcXRBWllYcU96cDZqNHU2bWhyTThIT1NZcXFYNVpaQlVITGE5YWRVMjFhYmpVNUJBM1dzbHBCanNVZG1vUTF0UXJpRWZZZ2FCSHNTNWo3YjUwUmdiaGNPVmQ0QjYxOWoyODNWZFZTSDBjZDRnejRfN29tUm5tQ01vTFZlYXlIZFc4VDVpd1JYaHdwMk1R0gH_AUFVX3lxTE5LelBvcDNGeXAwX2w2M1htNVNLR05yakFfVzlVZW91eU9FcllqQWV0NV9iV3ZZSWJSZDUwaVpaWF9lc2Q0TVMtTXNicnFlSDJlc0ZpNW1seTNPWTFJR1ZKMm1xZHJ4clRTSE5lOE5mWDVpWElDNFNsQVVJMGVoY0JDRjdkeWpUd2FrUzdUamdoX3lVYzZxS1Fva25tWUdWWTBiZ0xlRG1LQlZtZWx6UnJSUEllczEwenhCTVo5N1RQWGpWMTR5RUZLeFNRbnRBZ2k4dGE0UWd0aTk4SDgwdXRGaTI5QlMtVS1RVmYwbVdCeXdzQ2l4a2RscU1SVnhyZw</guid></item><item><title>迷幻蘑菇能让时光倒流吗？研究表明，裸盖菇素保留端粒长度- Medical Xpress | Can psychedelic mushrooms turn back the clock?

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A compound found in psychedelic mushrooms may have antiaging properties. Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine have found that psilocybin, the active compound in psychedelic mushrooms, may extend both cellular and organismal lifespans.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-025-00244-x" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;npj Aging&lt;/i&gt;, show that psilocybin reduced multiple hallmarks of aging in cells while also improving survival in aged mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There have been a number of clinical studies that have explored the therapeutic potential of psilocybin in psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety; however, few studies have evaluated its impacts outside the brain," said Dr. Louise Hecker, associate professor of medicine—&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cardiovascular+research/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cardiovascular research&lt;/a&gt; at Baylor and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The overwhelming majority of what we know about psilocybin is how it impacts the brain. Our findings suggest that psilocybin has potent effects on the entire body, including antiaging properties, which also may contribute to the plethora of observed beneficial clinical outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telomeres, the protective caps of repetitive DNA sequences located at the ends of chromosomes, shorten as we age—telomere shortening is a classic hallmark of aging. Hecker's research suggests that psilocybin treatment preserves telomere length, which contributes to cellular life extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current study, using human cells, the team found that psilocybin extended cellular lifespan by up to 57% depending on dosages. In cells, psilocin (the active metabolite of psilocybin) delayed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cellular+senescence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cellular senescence&lt;/a&gt;, preserved telomere length and reduced oxidative stress levels. Their findings also suggest it leads to increased SIRT1 expression, which is associated with regulating longevity, as well as other cellular markers indicating improved DNA damage responses.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers also noted a visible improvement in fur quality, which suggests healthier aging, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a very exciting and clinically relevant finding that suggests that even when intervention is initiated late in life, it can have dramatic impacts," said Dr. Kosuke Kato, lead author of the study and assistant professor of medicine—pulmonary at Baylor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings open an exciting new chapter in psychedelic research beyond its neurological and psychological benefits," Hecker said. "Psilocybin may represent a disruptive agent that promotes healthy aging. The next steps need to explore the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/therapeutic+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;therapeutic effects&lt;/a&gt; across multiple age-related diseases."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is important to note that additional research is needed to validate these findings in human studies," Kato said. "There is still a lot to understand, including optimal dosing protocols that will lead to maximal efficacy. We also need to better understand the potential risks of long-term psilocybin treatment before this type of treatment is ready for public use."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once validated in human studies, the use of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psilocybin/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psilocybin&lt;/a&gt; could offer new options for healthy aging and potentially age-associated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

For months, I thought nothing of it. But then the spot started turning red last December. “Maybe it’s just a pimple,” I thought to myself. A week went by. Then another. And another. The &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a19953557/bumps-you-should-never-pop/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a19953557/bumps-you-should-never-pop/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="annoying bump" data-node-id="0.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;annoying bump&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t changing in size, color, or tenderness like a normal zit would—and I was starting to get a little worried. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This peculiar blemish was painless, but it wasn’t showing any signs of fading and I didn’t like how it looked. So, I figured I’d bring it up to my dermatologist, &lt;a href="https://www.drkhorasani.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.drkhorasani.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hooman Khorasani" data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Hooman Khorasani&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a dermatologic and cosmetic surgeon in private practice in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;When Dr. Khorasani examined the spot under a microscope, he thought it looked a little suspicious because he could see blood vessels that aren’t normally visible in certain &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a60360644/acne-types/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a60360644/acne-types/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="types of acne" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;types of acne&lt;/a&gt;. He didn’t immediately assume it was something serious like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a60687451/the-current-state-of-skin-cancer/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a60687451/the-current-state-of-skin-cancer/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="skin cancer" data-node-id="2.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="2.3.0"&gt;skin cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; because I was only 31 years old at the time, and incidences of skin cancer rise sharply in those who are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6969010/#:~:text=of%20the%20authors.-,Risk%20Factors,12%2C%2016%E2%80%9321%5D." target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6969010/#:~:text=of%20the%20authors.-,Risk%20Factors,12%2C%2016%E2%80%9321%5D." data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="75 or older" data-node-id="2.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="2.5.0"&gt;75 or older&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But to be on the safe side, Dr. Khorasani collected a small piece of skin tissue and sent it to a lab to be analyzed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;All I had to do was wait for him to contact me with the results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="when-the-phone-rang-my-heart-sank" data-node-id="5" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="5.0"&gt;When the phone rang, my heart sank.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt; I was sitting at my desk in my Manhattan office building finishing up a day of work as a marketing professional in the beauty industry when Dr. Khorasani called and told me that the mysterious spot on my forehead was actually &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19949282/basal-cell-carcinoma/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19949282/basal-cell-carcinoma/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="basal cell carcinoma" data-node-id="6.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="6.1.0"&gt;basal cell carcinoma&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/basal-and-squamous-cell-skin-cancer/about/what-is-basal-and-squamous-cell.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/basal-and-squamous-cell-skin-cancer/about/what-is-basal-and-squamous-cell.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the most common form of skin cancer" data-node-id="6.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="6.3.0"&gt;the most common form of skin cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He explained that this type of cancer results from mutations in skin cells called keratinocytes. These mutations can be sporadic and happen randomly, but they’re often caused by exposure to UV radiation from the sun, or artificial radiation from &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a61898762/gen-z-tanning-bed-trend-risks/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a61898762/gen-z-tanning-bed-trend-risks/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="tanning beds" data-node-id="6.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="6.5.0"&gt;tanning beds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Hearing that I had “the Big C” was scary, but I felt like I was in good hands with Dr. Khorasani. He reassured me that we caught the lesion early and that the prognosis of basal cell carcinoma is excellent. We made an appointment to surgically remove the spot a couple weeks after I was diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Of course, there is never a &lt;em data-node-id="9.1"&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; time to get cancer. But my diagnosis came during a particularly hectic time in my personal and professional lives. For one, I had just married my husband, Sam, in September, and we were really looking forward to a mini honeymoon in Tulum, Mexico, in early February. Knowing I'd still be healing with my forehead covered with bandages, we decided to postpone the trip by several weeks. Around the same time, I was also given a thrilling opportunity to represent my company at the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. But like my upcoming vacation, I had to back out and stay home in Brooklyn to recover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-was-scared-to-have-a-scar-on-my-forehead-forever" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;I was scared to have a scar on my forehead forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The scheduling conflicts weren't the only thing that made my diagnosis frustrating. Even in the hands of one of the world’s top dermatologic and cosmetic surgeons, I still dreaded the permanent scar I would have on my forehead. After all, it’s not a spot that’s particularly easy to conceal from others. But come January 28th, Dr. Khorasani performed what’s called a Mohs micrographic surgery on my face. The procedure is done in stages, meaning Dr. Khorasani removed the cancerous skin cells bit by bit to ensure he spared the surrounding healthy tissue and minimized the size of the scar left behind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-13" data-node-id="12" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="large" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-large embed css-1mseg9i e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="writer emily haley the day she underwent mohs microgrpahic surgery to remove basal cell carcinoma from her forehead." title="writer emily haley the day she underwent mohs microgrpahic surgery to remove basal cell carcinoma from her forehead." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emily-surgery-day-jan-2025-68643657cf6fe.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.0570xh&amp;amp;resize=768:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emily-surgery-day-jan-2025-68643657cf6fe.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.0570xh&amp;amp;resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emily-surgery-day-jan-2025-68643657cf6fe.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.0570xh&amp;amp;resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emily-surgery-day-jan-2025-68643657cf6fe.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.0570xh&amp;amp;resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-fw50lw e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1gh9ql8 e1geg53v2"&gt;Emily Haley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;p data-element="caption" class="css-vaz8ot e1fodxfw1"&gt;Emily Haley the day she had surgery to remove basal cell carcinoma from her forehead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The procedure took about five hours and, all things considered, it was pretty easy and painless for me. What came after that took a larger toll: I was forced to wear white gauze on my forehead in the weeks following my surgery, and it was really awkward to explain why I looked the way I did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The state of my scar and the various bandages covering it naturally drew attention, but not necessarily the kind I wanted. I didn’t always feel like explaining myself or revealing that I had been dealing with cancer. However, I’m comforted by the fact that this phase in my life won’t last forever. And that’s because in the weeks and months following my procedure, Dr. Khorasani has—and continues—to perform several procedures to help improve the appearance of my scar. These include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="15" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="15.0"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0.0"&gt;Dermabrasion and CO₂ laser resurfacing&lt;/strong&gt;: Dermabrasion gently polishes the outermost surface of the scar to help smooth out any uneven texture. And CO₂ laser resurfacing uses a beam of light to precisely remove tiny columns of skin. When that skin heals, more collagen is produced which helps the scar tissue more closely resemble normal skin.&lt;br data-node-id="15.0.2"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="15.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.1.0"&gt;Vascular laser treatment&lt;/strong&gt;: This procedure involves using a beam of light to target and remove blood vessels in the skin, which reduces unwanted redness.&lt;br data-node-id="15.1.2"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="15.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.2.0"&gt;Bellafill injections&lt;/strong&gt;:  These gel injections help correct contour abnormalities from the scar, like raised areas or indentations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="15.3"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.3.0"&gt;Botox: &lt;/strong&gt;This injection helps relax the muscles in the forehead so they don't pull on the incision and stretch the scar. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Nevertheless, the healing process since the surgery hasn’t always been picture-perfect (my scar looks especially red immediately after treatments) but on good days, I’m happy to say that you’d hardly know the scar is there thanks to all the help from my doctor and his team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-embed="composite" data-lazy-id="P0-14" data-node-id="17" class="embed css-0 e17cny3g2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-1yt7om e17cny3g0"&gt;&lt;div

So growing up, my parents drilled into me the importance of wearing &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a64760024/facts-about-sunscreen/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a64760024/facts-about-sunscreen/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="sunscreen" data-node-id="19.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;sunscreen&lt;/a&gt;, not just while lounging on the beach in the summer, but every day, all year round. And despite spending most of my childhood indoors, at a dance studio in my hometown in Wisconsin, applying the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a46277622/how-much-sunscreen-to-use-on-your-face/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a46277622/how-much-sunscreen-to-use-on-your-face/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="right amount of sunscreen" data-node-id="19.7" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;right amount of sunscreen&lt;/a&gt; multiple times a day was second nature to my family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Nevertheless, my mom developed basal cell carcinoma on her chest when she was in her 60s, which was about seven or eight years ago. And when I was a child, my dad developed precancerous skin growths when he was in his 50s. My family history combined with my alabaster skin made it feel almost unavoidable that I’d face a similar fate. But in an attempt to protect myself, I stuck to my sunscreen routine, never used &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a61898762/gen-z-tanning-bed-trend-risks/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a61898762/gen-z-tanning-bed-trend-risks/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="tanning beds" data-node-id="20.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;tanning beds&lt;/a&gt;, and visited a dermatologist annually for skin cancer screenings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Developing basal cell carcinoma despite my good habits (and getting diagnosed decades earlier in life than my parents) came as a shock. It was a stark reminder that skin cancer can happen to &lt;em data-node-id="21.1"&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; at &lt;em data-node-id="21.3"&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="ive-become-a-hat-girly" data-node-id="22" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;I’ve become a hat girly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Since my diagnosis, I’ve become even more diligent about protecting my skin. Like always, I make sure to apply (and re-apply) sunscreen throughout the day, using products with an SPF of at least 35, as my doctor recommends. And my day-to-day plans don't determine whether I protect my skin. It doesn’t matter if I’m going for a long walk under the sun or leaving my home for a quick grocery run on a rainy day. Wearing sunscreen is like brushing my teeth—a non-negotiable part of my daily routine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;However, when I know that I’ll be spending some extra time outdoors, I do like to take extra precautions. During my trip to Tulum, for instance, I wore rash guards while lounging by the pool and beach, and I spent a lot of time hanging out in a cabana rather than exposing myself to direct sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;I also now visit my dermatologist for cancer screenings every six months instead of annually, as is recommended by the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/basal-and-squamous-cell-skin-cancer/after-treatment/follow-up.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/basal-and-squamous-cell-skin-cancer/after-treatment/follow-up.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Cancer Society." data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="25.1.0"&gt;American Cancer Society.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; And I plan to pay for &lt;a href="https://molesafe.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://molesafe.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="skin cancer surveillance services" data-node-id="25.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="25.3.0"&gt;skin cancer surveillance services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; once a year. The clinic I go to uses artificial intelligence to analyze high-quality photos of my whole body to determine whether I’ve developed any cancerous moles. But perhaps the most fun change in my life has been learning how to embrace wearing protective hats. Sun hats, baseball caps, bucket hats, you name it! Hats that offer coverage from the sun are a new staple of my personal style. And I’m enjoying experimenting and incorporating them into my outfits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-15" data-node-id="26" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="writer emily haley enjoying her vacation by relaxing under a cabana and wearing a rash guard to protect herself from getting skin cancer." title="writer emily haley enjoying her vacation by relaxing under a cabana and wearing a rash guard to protect herself from getting skin cancer." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/vacation-mexico-february2025-raw-6864338f42bde.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.220xh&amp;amp;resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/vacation-mexico-february2025-raw-6864338f42bde.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.220xh&amp;amp;resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/vacation-mexico-february2025-raw-6864338f42bde.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.220xh&amp;amp;resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/vacation-mexico-february2025-raw-6864338f42bde.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.220xh&amp;amp;resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1gh9ql8 e1geg53v2"&gt;Emily Haley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;p data-element="caption" class="css-vaz8ot e1fodxfw1"&gt;Emily Haley enjoying her vacation in Tulum, Mexico, while protecting her skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;After months of walking around with various hats and scar coverings, I no longer worry what other people think of me or how I look.

              &lt;p&gt;Scientists are developing all sorts of potential new treatments to tackle the most difficult cancer cases—including some that will make you thankful for the existence of herpes and other viruses. Clinical trial data out today shows that a modified version of the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) can help keep late-stage skin cancer at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Southern California and others conducted the study, a Phase I/II trial of people with advanced, treatment-resistant melanoma. About a third of patients given the modified virus, in combination with immunotherapy, saw their tumors substantially shrink, while some even experienced a complete regression of their cancer. A larger, definitive trial of the experimental therapy, code-named RP1, is already underway, and the Food and Drug Administration will decide on an approval later this month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists have been intrigued about the promise of cancer-fighting, or oncolytic, viruses for over a century, according to study author Gino In, a medical oncologist at USC’s Keck School of Medicine. But it’s only recently that this potential has started to look within reach.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Most progress has been made just in the last few decades, thanks to advances and progression in gene editing technologies, which have allowed researchers to specifically design oncolytic viruses that are more effective and safer,” In told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HSV-1, the primary cause of cold sores, has emerged as a particularly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8235327/"&gt;promising candidate&lt;/a&gt; for cancer treatment. HSV-1 is a relatively large virus, meaning scientists can replace or add new genes without too much trouble. And though it does use our cells to replicate, like any virus, it doesn’t insert its DNA into a cell’s genome directly, eliminating the risk of certain mutations (an important consideration for safety). A typical HSV-1 infection also isn’t life-threatening and can be treated with antiviral medications if needed, further limiting its potential danger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These properties have allowed scientists to create strains of the virus that can selectively target cancer cells. The first herpes-based cancer therapy (T-VEC) was &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2015/t-vec-melanoma"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. in 2015 for some cases of metastatic melanoma. But researchers like In are especially excited by the new generation of these treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RP1 is the brainchild of biotech company Replimune, and it’s one of &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/herpes-virus-cancer-treatment-rp2-1849574410"&gt;several cancer-fighting viruses&lt;/a&gt; that the company is currently developing. Compared to the typical HSV-1 virus, RP1 has been weakened, meaning it shouldn’t be able to cause severe infections. It’s also been modified to not only target cancer cells, but to also boost the immune system’s natural tumor-killing ability.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These changes make RP1 both safer and better at killing cancer cells than natural HSV-1,” In explained. And while RP1 might be a viable treatment on its own, Replimune is also testing whether it can be even more effective when paired with other existing immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This latest study involved 140 patients from the company’s IGNYTE trial of RP1 conducted across several sites, including at USC. The participants had late-stage melanoma that was unresponsive to earlier immunotherapy treatment. They received both RP1 and nivolumab, an immunotherapy drug commonly used for melanoma, every two weeks for up to four months. If patients responded to the initial treatment, they continued taking nivolumab alone for up to two years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the study’s end, a third of patients saw their tumors decrease in size by at least 30%, the researchers found, and almost one in every six patients had their tumors disappear entirely. Importantly, this shrinkage was seen in tumors directly injected with RP1 as well as uninjected tumors throughout the body—indicating its immune-boosting potential worked as hoped. The combination therapy also appeared to be safe, with most patients only experiencing minor adverse events like fatigue or other flu-like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings were &lt;a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/246581"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and were &lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO-25-01346"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This study provides an important new approach for patients with immunotherapy-refractory melanoma; this is very important since about half of all melanoma patients&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;do not benefit from immunotherapy,” said In. “So it provides a new type of treatment, one that is both effective and well tolerated.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early trials are primarily intended to vet an experimental treatment’s safety and optimal dosing, not its effectiveness. But given the general outlook of these normally untreatable cases, there’s certainly reason to be optimistic here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, Replimune launched a Phase III trial that will test RP1 &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06264180"&gt;combined&lt;/a&gt; with nivolumab in around 400 people with treatment-resistant melanoma. But even before this study concludes, RP1 could become available to the public. In January, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.cancernetwork.com/view/rp1-nivolumab-earns-priority-review-in-anti-pd-1-failed-advanced-melanoma"&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; to consider the combination therapy for &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/accelerated-approval"&gt;accelerated approval&lt;/a&gt;, a process that allows a novel treatment to be tentatively approved with less direct evidence of its effectiveness (further trial data is still required to secure a full approval). The FDA’s decision on RP1 is scheduled for July 22.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In and the USC team will continue to study their data to better understand how RP1 works. But they expect RP1 to become a new option for these resistant melanoma cases, and In notes that RP1 is also being tested for other kinds of cancer. If things keep going right, virus-based therapies like RP1 could soon become the next frontier of cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

What causes that imbalance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="9" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="9.0"&gt;Antibiotics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You know how antibiotics can throw off your gut microbiome and upset your stomach? They can also affect other bacteria throughout your body. “The most common reason [for oral thrush] is &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a34239788/antibiotics-for-uti/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a34239788/antibiotics-for-uti/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="taking antibiotics" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;taking antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Zingman says. “This kills off the good bacteria and allows for yeast to grow because there won’t be that competition for space anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="11" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.0"&gt;Weakened Immune System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Anyone with an impaired immune system is at risk, because it’s harder to keep the yeast under control, Dr. Zingman says. This includes those with &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a62235177/endocrinologists-guide-to-diabetes/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a62235177/endocrinologists-guide-to-diabetes/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="diabetes" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, cancer, and uncontrolled HIV or AIDS. It also includes those on immune-suppressing medications and those with immune deficiencies due to medical procedures like chemotherapy, organ transplants, or stem cell transplants, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="13" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="13.0"&gt;Inhaled Steroids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Inhaled steroids are an immune-suppressing drug, and they can leave residue in your mouth, allowing yeast to grow. “If a lot of the steroid is deposited in their mouth instead of in their lungs, that suppresses the immune system of the mucus membrane,” Dr. Zingman explains. Many doctors that prescribe inhaled steroids (often for asthma or lung conditions) will recommend rinsing your mouth after taking the inhaler, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="15" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;Poor Dental Hygiene&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you aren’t brushing your teeth properly, you could leave extra room for bacteria and fungi to grow. This is particularly true for people with dentures: Cleaning them incorrectly can allow yeast to overgrow and cause an infection, Dr. Zingman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="17" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;Breastfeeding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Because babies have weaker immune systems, they’re predisposed to getting candidiasis, explains &lt;a href="https://www.onemedical.com/providers/natasha-bhuyan/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.onemedical.com/providers/natasha-bhuyan/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Natasha Bhuyan, M.D." data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="18.1.0"&gt;Natasha Bhuyan, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, regional medical director at One Medical. Both bottle-fed or breastfed babies can get the infection. “This is likely from the infant’s mouth coming into contact with something that contains candida,” she says. “This can also happen if nipples are cracked or have any growth of candida.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="19" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="19.0"&gt;Oral Thrush Symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Oral yeast infection symptoms range from mild to extremely severe and painful, Dr. Zingman says. But some common signs include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="21" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.0"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0.0"&gt;Difficulty eating: &lt;/strong&gt;Oral thrush causes discomfort, making it harder to eat and swallow. And if the candida infection spreads down your esophagus, it can make it difficult for food to pass properly, Dr. Zingman says.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.1.0"&gt;Burning mouth:&lt;/strong&gt; The infection may cause your mouth to burn, especially on, underneath, and around your tongue, Dr. Zingman explains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.2.0"&gt;White or red marks: &lt;/strong&gt;Some people notice white marks in their mouths when they’re brushing their teeth. These spots might also be red, if they’re inflamed, Dr. Zingman says. You can differentiate between these white patches and other white lesions because you can easily scrape them off, adds &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/michael-d-turner" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/michael-d-turner" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Michael D.

In many mild cases, a visit to the doctor isn’t even necessary. Instead, you can use a toothbrush to clean the area and remove any of the overgrown fungus, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If the infection is extremely uncomfortable—or if the person is immunocompromised—many doctors will prescribe an anti-fungal medication, Dr. Zingman says. These treatments typically last seven to 14 days, depending upon the patient’s response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Some doctors may also use a tongue depressor to scrape off large areas of overgrown yeast, both to help diagnose and to relieve some of the discomfort, Dr. Zingman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Because the most common cause of candida infections is antibiotics, it’s best to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a27396444/skipping-antibiotic-medicine/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a27396444/skipping-antibiotic-medicine/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="only take antibiotics" data-node-id="28.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;only take antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; when absolutely necessary, Dr. Zingman says. Don’t take more than you need to, and don’t take them when you don’t need them (like when you have a viral infection).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s also imperative to practice good oral hygiene by brushing your teeth and any other tools, like dentures, regularly, Dr. Zingman says. If you’re concerned about using an oral steroid, always rinse it well after use, work on your technique with a doctor, or use an extender on the inhalation pump to help get the medication down your lungs, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If your oral yeast infections are recurring, it’s important to get to the bottom of it and treat the underlying issue, Dr. Bhuyan says. Be sure to see your primary care provider. In very rare cases, you may be prescribed antifungal medication as a preventative measure, Dr. Zingman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;And don’t worry too much about catching the infection from someone else—unless you’re also immunocompromised or on antibiotics yourself. “It’s not significantly contagious,” Dr. Zingman says. “The yeast is a normal part of our bodies. The exposure of someone with candida does not significantly increase our chances of getting it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While you may want to avoid direct contact with someone’s spit if they have oral thrush, it’s not worth stressing over. “It’s unlikely to pass from person to person if healthy adults are involved, as the immune system will generally control the growth of candida,” Dr. Bhuyan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 17:47:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNWnVRSXNjVkpjS3F1bEJZQUdROEdicG9ZY3dyRFhFUHhkaUMzNlIyLTJ6bzd2Q0syX0NsRUI1STY0NVlCNDU1NDlWOXlQbF9MQ0NlQXhpd0pnS0l5TlhIYm9DTDZLYVFrRFFMUDFySV9LWUVaTm5FWGtPbXdvbFB0TXVBMGN2a3pDUXpfM0dpb1VYaVo1cUxZ</guid></item><item><title>新妈妈的致命妊娠并发症被斥为“焦虑” - TODAY.com | New Mom's Deadly Pregnancy Complication Dismissed as 'Anxiety' - TODAY.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPc3dwOWxEdkVtNjIyWHgzZE9YNDRTdWRJdk54dlBhNV9hdjZvQlMwYnJqaVBNYzQ4dzZKeTVTRWhLTW5Mb19hZEZPd2pOaVlDeEZlcndHd3RSYkxMTVBlX2JjT25jNHZkMXpGbjZkU1g4TFBzelN2ZEYzelJxQWhibjVrRGpqdllOckM5LU5B0gFUQVVfeXFMUHdGQ1d2QlV4SUNXenhMcmRSTGl3TkY5RGdKQ0F5dVQ1WVhvZkctVUNmdHB6eExITFR2ZXpFR2NqZ0xXMUwyRUphc2p3aWl4OFJEUFlY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fd2cc9" class="body-graf"&gt;Most of Lindsay Herriott's first pregnancy had been "super easy," she tells TODAY.com. She gave birth in September 2022, and that was relatively simple as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a8ceef" class="body-graf"&gt;At 10-and-a-half pounds, her new son, Davis, was as big as she'd been warned he would be. But Herriott was "discharged really quickly," and went home ready for rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5b0d0c" class="body-graf"&gt;Herriott, 40, of Chicago, Illinois, was feeling swollen and tired, noting that her legs especially were swollen. But she was told this was all normal, especially after giving birth to a large baby, and went home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fb9d0c" class="body-graf"&gt;"We'd only been home a day or so, and it got to the point where I couldn't lay down," she recalls. "If I laid down, I felt like my heart was racing, and I just couldn't sleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a036a7" class="body-graf"&gt;She called her obstetrician's office multiple times and was told by staff, "You're stressed, you're worried about your baby, you're a first-time mom," Herriott says. A Google search confirmed that anxiety or stress could explain her symptoms on paper, but the label still didn't feel right to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cd5b8f" class="body-graf"&gt;A close friend, who also happens to be a therapist, reminded Herriott that anxiety isn't normal for her. "I have my own problems, but anxiety is not one of them," Herriott says. "I’ve never had the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/how-to-get-rid-of-sunday-scaries-rcna85611" target="_blank"&gt;Sunday scaries&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a6ee26" class="body-graf"&gt;She let it go for another day or two, but developed "a really heavy chest and an awful cough," she says. Herriott called her doctor's office again and was told that she probably &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/specials/effects-covid-19-on-pregnancy/" target="_blank"&gt;had COVID&lt;/a&gt;, she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5ceb20" class="body-graf"&gt;But her symptoms only got worse. Soon after, Herriott was up at night feeding her baby when she thought she was coughing up phlegm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-91602d" class="body-graf"&gt;"When I turned on the light, I saw I was actually spitting up blood," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cc4ae1" class="body-graf"&gt;At that point, Herriott knew she needed to rush to urgent care, where her &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/what-normal-range-blood-pressure-reading-t174055" target="_blank"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; reading was "200 over something" and the situation felt "really scary," she recalls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9b1411" class="body-graf"&gt;Herriott turned down the offer of an ambulance and drove herself to the hospital. To her surprise, she was "whisked back quickly," and diagnosed with postpartum preeclampsia, a potentially life-threatening &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/parents/moms/postpartum-preeclampsia-mom-details-experience-rcna79764" target="_blank"&gt;pregnancy complication&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-71da37" class="body-heading"&gt;Preeclampsia Can Happen During Pregnancy — Or Right After Giving Birth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-700f3f" class="body-graf"&gt;"Preeclampsia is a blood pressure condition that occurs either at the end of or just after a pregnancy," Dr. Priya Freaney, director of the Northwestern Postpartum Hypertension Program within the Women's Heart Care Program, tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fd4284" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s a form of hypertension (high blood pressure) that can have severe, even life-threatening, complications for both the pregnant person and their baby if it's not treated promptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f74e4b" class="body-graf"&gt;The vast majority of cases of preeclampsia happen during pregnancy, says Freaney, who is now Herriott’s cardiologist. And postpartum preeclampsia occurs in fewer than 1% of all pregnancy, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-752dfb" class="body-graf"&gt;During or after pregnancy, preeclampsia can cause symptoms such as severe headaches, shortness of breath, changes in vision, pain in the upper belly and nausea or vomiting, the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/preeclampsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355745" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-583979"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/new-mom-anxiety-zz-250707-c69f5a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/new-mom-anxiety-zz-250707-c69f5a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/new-mom-anxiety-zz-250707-c69f5a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/new-mom-anxiety-zz-250707-c69f5a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/new-mom-anxiety-zz-250707-c69f5a.jpg" alt="Herriott (right) experienced postpartum preeclampsia after both of her pregnancies."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Herriott (right) experienced postpartum preeclampsia after both of her pregnancies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Lindsay Herriott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d6ce1c" class="body-graf"&gt;In Herriott's case, another condition — a leaky mitral valve in her heart — caused her to cough up blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-843b2b" class="body-graf"&gt;This condition is "often asymptomatic for many years or decades for people," Freaney explains, "and only comes to light when the system is provoked in a way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-806b2d" class="body-graf"&gt;Herriott's elevated blood pressure, combined with the extra fluid in her body due to pregnancy, caused her mitral valve leak to push fluid backwards into the lungs. That can lead to shortness of breath and coughing up blood, Freaney says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-09e066" class="body-graf"&gt;Because of the preeclampsia, Herriott's medical team took a deeper look at her heart and discovered the mitral valve issue. Both conditions will require some additional monitoring for the rest of Herriott's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-7ce8c2" class="body-heading"&gt;A Second Pregnancy Gave Herriott Another Set of Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-46bb2c" class="body-graf"&gt;Knowing that having preeclampsia once put her at risk for the condition again, Herriott's was on the lookout for the symptoms during her second pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ed211e" class="body-graf"&gt;After giving birth to son Oakley in October 2024, she was discharged. And, just a few days later, she noticed her heart racing when she tried to lie down — just like before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-68f5c8" class="body-graf"&gt;"I felt like I couldn't really breathe and I was just in a panic," she recalls. "I was like, 'Maybe I'm just having PTSD, but my chest feels so heavy.'" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b9088f" class="body-graf"&gt;This time, Herriott woke her husband up and contacted her cardiologist's office. A few hours later, she got a call from the nurse, who urged her to rush to the ER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0ed5ae" class="body-graf"&gt;Again, Herriott was rushed back for testing. This time, though, she was diagnosed with preeclampsia — and a pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs), another life-threatening complication that can occur after pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ca4f42" class="body-graf"&gt;For Herriott, the experience stirred up a mix of emotions. While she was relieved to have a cardiologist in her corner who could advocate for her in the hospital, learning she also had a pulmonary embolism was terrifying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-43cfc7" class="body-graf"&gt;"I immediately started crying because that's what you see in movies where &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/what-pulmonary-embolism-pregnant-influencer-emily-mitchell-dies-lung-clot-t205923" target="_blank"&gt;people just drop dead&lt;/a&gt;," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0df0a2" class="body-graf"&gt;Herriott was treated promptly in the hospital, and then had to give herself injections of a blood thinner until she was done breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-2f0875"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/new-mom-anxiety-zz-250707-01-e5208e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/new-mom-anxiety-zz-250707-01-e5208e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/new-mom-anxiety-zz-250707-01-e5208e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/new-mom-anxiety-zz-250707-01-e5208e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/new-mom-anxiety-zz-250707-01-e5208e.jpg" alt="Herriott and her younger son Oakley, who is now 8 months old."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Herriott and her younger son Oakley, who is now 8 months old.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Lindsay Herriott&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-b00313" class="body-heading"&gt;Preeclampsia Has Lifelong Implications for Heart Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4ae126" class="body-graf"&gt;“A lot of people believe that preeclampsia is a pregnancy problem, and when the pregnancy is over, the preeclampsia is over,” Freaney says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-701f1c" class="body-graf"&gt;But the message experts are trying to deliver now is that “preeclampsia predicts future heart health,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-48e8b7" class="body-graf"&gt;Having preeclampsia is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease later on, including heart attack and stroke, research shows. And those elevated risks can &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/womens-health/high-blood-pressure-pregnancy-heart-disease-risk-rcna28982" target="_blank"&gt;persist for decades&lt;/a&gt; after giving birth, as TODAY.com explained previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-86d455" class="body-graf"&gt;So, while preeclampsia emerges during or directly after pregnancy, it can have a lifelong impact. That's why Freaney encourages people to think of preeclampsia as "an opportunity for heart disease prevention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bbd75f" class="body-graf"&gt;Herriott's newly diagnosed health conditions mean she'll be in contact with her cardiologist for the rest of her life. She monitors &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/at-home-blood-pressure-monitoring-rcna93872" target="_blank"&gt;her own blood pressure regularly&lt;/a&gt;, and she may one day need her &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/news/heart-transplant-helps-3-girls-living-mitral-valve-replacement-rcna193845" target="_blank"&gt;mitral valve replaced&lt;/a&gt;, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e377ef" class="body-graf"&gt;She encourages others to push to find a doctor they trust. Ideally, that doctor is someone who, like Freaney, specializes in the condition you're dealing with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5e1d83" class="body-graf"&gt;More than anything, though, Herriott hopes her story encourages others to take their symptoms seriously, and to trust their instincts when something feels wrong — especially after giving birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eb2f86" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Looking back on her second pregnancy, Herriott says, "I was proud of myself for trusting my own gut and (recognizing) that, even in the throes of all the hormones, you do know your body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 17:27:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxPc3dwOWxEdkVtNjIyWHgzZE9YNDRTdWRJdk54dlBhNV9hdjZvQlMwYnJqaVBNYzQ4dzZKeTVTRWhLTW5Mb19hZEZPd2pOaVlDeEZlcndHd3RSYkxMTVBlX2JjT25jNHZkMXpGbjZkU1g4TFBzelN2ZEYzelJxQWhibjVrRGpqdllOckM5LU5B0gFUQVVfeXFMUHdGQ1d2QlV4SUNXenhMcmRSTGl3TkY5RGdKQ0F5dVQ1WVhvZkctVUNmdHB6eExITFR2ZXpFR2NqZ0xXMUwyRUphc2p3aWl4OFJEUFlY</guid></item><item><title>专家发现年轻人癌症死亡人数“大幅增加”的原因……以及真正的死亡人数--《每日邮报》 | Experts discover the cause of 'enormous increase' of cancer deaths in young people... and the true toll it takes - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxNZE16OUxKdWxhdTZaX2thYnRmVzBUYnZCME10c1pBcjBXVk1Sa1FDQUJrYU1mc1dmanhXOHg0YXZLRXZTQ3BWTDVZaXM4dVV6WEFhS0tyZHJRVzZORWp6U2RJRnZHYzh2bnM3RGQwQWNjYWVCMkJEcWFuU3gxX2FKd1NqZzJCaF9reHJra2VacTRyRDg1YnRlR3V3R3A1YmIxQjNZ0gGoAUFVX3lxTE55TGVEU28xQi1KMlE2UzlEbldYYkZPRzlHZFI2Z3RFZlZPRHpZQUloRTNxZzFTbG1fQVJWZGN2bmpGWDZNaEhYRjlmRlFKakpYaXFuTHdZMnpqYVVNMHEzdXBFRVNPX3ZzMUptdTc2T0ItVWVVbk1hcmEyWjJKdmpremNqLS1pMDRDcnFuMllTTmp4aWpUeE9VQmo5ckQ2THZBZ215d1NLVA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have revealed the reason why an increasing number of young adults are now found to be suffering from late-stage colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-19990fb0-5c17-11f0-88ad-57bc4c87bc6c"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early onset colorectal cancer has become the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for men under 50 and the second-leading cause for women under 50 in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 50,000 Americans are &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14799325/addiction-cancer-Crave-book-smoking-alcohol-fast-food.html" class=""&gt;expected to die from colorectal cancer this year&lt;/a&gt;, while 150,000 are predicted to be diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While still a minority, experts remain concerned about increasing cases among younger people as officials estimate 2,600 new cases among those under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies also suggest that cases in people between 20 to 24 have risen by 185 percent while the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-a5657540-5c0f-11f0-88ad-57bc4c87bc6c"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; noted a 333 percent increase in cases among teenagers between 15 to 19 as of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases are also expected to double between 2010 and 2030, after having risen two percent a year since the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now, researchers from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School found that patients with early-onset colorectal cancers often experience delays in diagnosis because neither physicians nor patients initially suspect that they are suffering from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, doctors are more likely to diagnose patients when they are at advanced stages of the disease - leading to aggressive forms of treatment and lower chances of survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to research, reasons such as non-obvious symptoms, lack of routine screening and confusion with other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and Crohn's disease can contribute to a delay in diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And not only do young people experience a delay in diagnosis but they also endure hardships unique to their age group such as infertility, medical debt and mental health struggles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Over 50,000 Americans are expected to die from colorectal cancer this year, while 150,000 are predicted to be diagnosed with the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author Sara K. Char, a clinical fellow in Hematology and Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, said: 'The incidence of GI cancers in adults younger than age 50 is rising globally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ongoing research efforts investigating the biology of early-onset GI cancers are critical to developing more effective screening, prevention, and treatment strategies.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers conducted a comprehensive literature review of multiple studies focusing on early-onset colorectal, esophagogastric and pancreatic cancers from across the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, they also reviewed previous studies on rare early onset gastrointestinal GI cancers including appendix and neuroendocrine tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists particularly focused on studies that highlighted the risk factors, common patterns, observable traits and underlying genetic reasons that cause colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed that one of the most common reasons why young people were not being treated during early stages of colon cancer was due to late diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most colorectal cancers start as colon polyps - tumors in the wall of the colon - that are usually non-cancerous and can be removed during colonoscopies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, sometimes these tumors can turn cancerous if left untreated for prolonged periods of time, according to John Hopkins University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, colorectal cancers do not show symptoms in the early stages - making regular screening tests such as a coloscopy essential to ensure good colon health. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the CDC recommends that people should begin to get colonoscopies at the age of 45 and repeat every five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency notes that people under the age of 45 suffering from Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or have a family history of colon cancer should also get tested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the CDC has no such recommendations for young people experiencing symptoms that may not have a family history of colon cancer or are suffering from related diseases - leading to delayed diagnosis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And common symptoms such as abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation), rectal bleeding and weight loss can also be misdiagnosed as IBS or Crohn's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lead author Sara K. Char, a clinical fellow in Hematology and Oncology at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A lack of clear early symptoms combined with irregular screening can lead to delays in colon cancer diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with this, the researchers involved in this study also revealed the toll a cancer diagnosis can take on a young adult - which can further fuel delays in diagnosis or treatment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists noted that despite being in their peak earning years, young patients are more likely to experience financial hardship because of their cancer diagnosis due to treatment costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a 2024 &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.fightcancer.org/policy-resources/survivor-views-majority-cancer-patients-survivors-have-or-expect-have-medical-debt"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network found that nearly half of cancer patients and survivors had medical debt of over $5,000 despite most of them being insured. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found that those with cancer-related medical debt are three times more likely to be behind on recommended cancer screenings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, 27 percent of those surveyed with cancer-related medical debt have gone without adequate food and 25 percent have skipped or delayed care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 50 percent of people saw their credit scores decrease and 30 percent had difficulty qualifying for loans - making their financial condition even worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Aggressive forms of treatment can also damage a patient's chances of having a children as excessive radiation can damage and kill reproductive cells and tissues in the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though official guidelines for early-onset and average-onset cancers are the same, researchers emphasized that younger patients are more likely to receive aggressive colon cancer treatment, often without a survival advantage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These aggressive forms of treatment can also damage a patient's chances of having a children as excessive radiation can damage and kill reproductive cells and tissues in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though the American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends that oncologists discuss treatment-related fertility concerns with patients of reproductive age, a recent study found that 50 percent of patients reported that their doctors did not talk to them about the impact of their disease or treatment on having future children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can make it difficult for couples' or individuals to conceive over time and impact their quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also found that early-onset colorectal cancer survivors are also more likely to report problems with anxiety, body image and sexual dysfunction compared to advanced onset survivors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are also more likely to report worse social functioning and physical quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, male patients with early onset colorectal cancers are more likely to suffer depression than those diagnosed with average onset colorectal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, the involved researchers concluded that 'a better understanding of underlying etiologies, optimized screening strategies and improved survivorship support is necessary' for young adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was published today in BJS journal by Oxford University Press. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE Agriculture, Land and Fisheries Ministry has launched a surveillance initiative after a possible case of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) at a pig farm in North Trinidad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry said in a July 8 press release that PRRS, also known as blue ear disease, is a serious condition affecting domestic pigs, characterised by reproductive failure (abortion, stillbirths, infertility), respiratory symptoms (pneumonia, coughing, sneezing), and increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that PRRS is not a zoonotic disease and poses no threat to food safety and human health. Local pork remains safe for human consumption, the release said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, the ministry is working with the suspected premises and the situation is given the highest priority regarding disease containment and investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nationwide surveillance program on pig farms has been implemented by the ministry's veterinary team to determine if/how far the disease has spread. The ministry is still awaiting country-wide results, which will determine the next course of action for this situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239531467-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release said the ministry's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory was well-equipped to carry out the required testing locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pig farmers should use this time to enhance the biosecurity practices on their premises. These measures include, but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensuring only healthy pigs with proper records are allowed to enter farms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quarantine of new stock for at least three weeks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Placing wheel baths at the entrance of premises and foot baths containing a bleach solution (1 part bleach to 9 parts water) or any other broad spectrum virucidal disinfectant at the recommended dilution/concentration) at the entrance of each pen/section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sanitising all vehicles and personnel prior to entry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not allow non-essential visitors on the premises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep records of all personnel and visitors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep premises as clean as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure pest control measures are in place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid sharing equipment between farms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that pork meat remains safe for human consumption, as PRRS has not been shown to cause illness in humans. However, pigs should not be fed pork meat, as they can become infected with the disease via this practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If pigs are displaying signs of illness and/or mortality, do not sell or purchase these animals, and contact your county veterinary officer as soon as possible during the hours 8 am-  4 pm Monday - Friday and they will advise accordingly.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;

Or, you forgot to submit your cable bill payment online last week. Hey, no judgment—when it comes to getting older, forgetting stuff is part of the deal. But what if your memory loss &lt;em data-node-id="0.1"&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; seem like a typical part of getting older, and this is happening, like, all the time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you’re a woman, that's a serious question to consider. Two-thirds of all Alzheimer’s patients and caregivers are female, according to the &lt;a href="https://thewomensalzheimersmovement.org/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://thewomensalzheimersmovement.org/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Women’s Alzheimer’s Movement" data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Women’s Alzheimer’s Movement&lt;/a&gt;, meaning women are disproportionately affected by the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While the reasons behind that reality aren't totally clear, hormones are likely at play. “Women who have had hysterectomies, gone through early menopause, or had any early loss of estrogen are particularly vulnerable,” says David A. Merrill, MD, PhD, neurologist and geriatric psychiatrist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica. “We know estrogen has a protective effect on the brain and supports healthy brain function.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;To make matters worse, Dr. Merrill says the psychological and cognitive processes of getting older mimic the early warning signs of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62854242/how-to-improve-brain-health/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62854242/how-to-improve-brain-health/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="dementia" data-node-id="5.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; syndromes (&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64232091/alzheimers-treatments-womens-brains/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64232091/alzheimers-treatments-womens-brains/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alzheimer’s" data-node-id="5.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; is the most common one). So it can be easy to dismiss these first signs of brain degeneration as run-of-the-mill aging.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Getting familiar with the early and first signs of the disease here—straight from neurologists!—will make you that much more prepared to take action if and when you notice something seems off with you or someone you love down the line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="memory-loss-is-affecting-your-day-to-day-life" data-node-id="7" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt; 1. Memory loss is affecting your day-to-day life. &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="8" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="9" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="10" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You’re about to order your a.m. latte from your local coffee shop when you realize you can’t remember the barista’s name...and she serves you five days a week. Is that bad? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Probably not, says Henry Paulson, MD, PhD, neurologist and director of the University of Michigan’s Alzheimer’s Disease Center. “As we age, our brains change,” he says. “It’s normal for things like our speed of thinking and recall of names to slow down.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Alzheimer’s-related &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65171543/well-being-brain-health-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65171543/well-being-brain-health-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="memory loss" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;memory loss&lt;/a&gt; is more than just not being able to remember someone’s name. “[We’re talking about] forgetting major events or having a loss of whole episodes,” Dr. Paulson explains. For example, “You don’t remember going on a beach vacation for three days with your family or attending your grandchild’s birthday party last weekend,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-13" data-node-id="14" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="brain memory loss concept" title="Brain memory loss concept" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/brain-memory-loss-concept-royalty-free-image-1744207217.pjpeg?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/brain-memory-loss-concept-royalty-free-image-1744207217.pjpeg?resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/brain-memory-loss-concept-royalty-free-image-1744207217.pjpeg?resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/brain-memory-loss-concept-royalty-free-image-1744207217.pjpeg?resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1gh9ql8 e1geg53v2"&gt;Flavio Coelho&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-fj96c5 e1geg53v0"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-1gh9ql8 e1geg53v1"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Paulson adds that misplacing items—like consistently putting your car keys in the fridge or not knowing what room to find your toothbrush—also falls under the umbrella of memory loss, along with not knowing what day of the week or month it is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;One more thing: Sometimes people will rely too heavily on tricks like repetition or note-taking to force themselves to remember things they know they’ll forget—so if you (or a loved one) notice you're doing this, it's worth seeing a neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="youre-having-issues-with-language-and-vision" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;2. You're having issues with language and vision.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you’re struggling with speaking or writing or experiencing visual impairments, it’s also time to contact your doc. Early brain degeneration can make it hard to communicate and engage with your environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“You might notice spatial changes in your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a30770184/crohns-disease-eyes/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a30770184/crohns-disease-eyes/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="vision" data-node-id="19.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt; or even have difficulty perceiving the world around you,” explains Dr. Paulson. “When you speak, you’re having to take the long way around and come up with other phrases to explain what you need because you can’t remember the exact word.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Again, these problems go beyond squinting at the television from across the room or writing the wrong date on your checks, which are all normal parts of aging; early Alzheimer's symptoms would likely be more obvious and ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="you-cant-seem-to-problem-solve-or-use-good-judgment" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;3. You can't seem to problem solve or use good judgment. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;There are several red flags to look out for within this category, including trouble completing tasks, problem-solving, and displaying poor judgment. According to Dr. Paulson, our brains have to process a range of information in order to productively move through our day-to-day lives. The degeneration brought on by early Alzheimer’s can make something as simple as choosing what to order for lunch a complicated decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;People in early stages of the disease may show other signs of cognitive deterioration such as being unable to follow directions or recipes, making serious financial errors, or struggling to maintain a healthy hygiene routine, per the &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/10_signs" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/10_signs" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alzheimer’s Association" data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="youre-withdrawing-from-your-social-life" data-node-id="24" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="24.0"&gt;4. You're withdrawing from your social life.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Did you (or your aging mother, perhaps) used to be the life of every party—but now you're staying home more and more often from social gatherings? You could be experiencing a normal decrease in energy...or it could be an early warning sign of Alzheimer’s.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Paulson says when brain degeneration makes it hard to remember commitments, participate in conversations, or engage fully in social events, many people begin to withdraw from these activities.  Sometimes this is a symptom of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19920419/depression-symptoms-in-women/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19920419/depression-symptoms-in-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="depression" data-node-id="27.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; (which also shouldn’t be ignored), but either way it’s important to seek help if someone’s behavior seems out of character for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="your-mood-or-personality-seems-drastically-different" data-node-id="28" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.0"&gt;5.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greek yogurt is slightly richer in micronutrients, lower in lactose, and a more consistent source of probiotics, making it a great option for gut health and those with dairy sensitivities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cottage cheese edges out Greek yogurt in protein content per serving but is notably higher in sodium, which may be a concern for those watching their salt intake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both are nutritious, high-protein snacks that support muscle, bone, and immune health—so the “better” choice really depends on your health goals, taste preferences, and dietary needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://cms.greenhouse.dotdash.com/edit/11767885?vertical=REALSIMPLE" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/cottage-cheese-health-benefits-7109196" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt; are extremely popular dairy choices—both are featured ubiquitously across social media. But beyond being tasty additions to sweet and savory recipes alike, they’re equally loved for their unique nutritional benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although both Greek yogurt and cottage cheese are made from cow’s milk and touted as &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-protein-dinner-recipes-11737611" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-protein&lt;/a&gt;, they actually offer slightly different nutrition. Each has their place and may be a better fit for certain individuals, depending on their needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here, we’ll explore the ins and outs of Greek yogurt and cottage cheese—what makes them unique, the nutrition they offer, and which is a better choice when prioritizing protein intake.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; First things first, what is Greek yogurt?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Greek yogurt is made by curdling milk and then straining it multiple times to remove a significant amount of liquid whey, to result in a thicker, creamier, and much more tart yogurt than regular yogurt. In turn, it contains less lactose and is significantly higher in protein,” shares Jamie Baham, MS, RDN, LD, registered dietitian and owner of Ladybug Nutrition.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, you can also expect Greek yogurt to offer plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/probiotic-foods-7643548" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, this nutritional analysis tells us a lot about how Greek yogurt can benefit overall health. “It delivers high-quality protein, probiotics for &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-foods-for-gut-health-7098940" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;, and key nutrients like &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/high-calcium-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/foods-high-in-potassium" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, phosphorus, and vitamins A, B2, and B12,” explains Ali McGowan, MS, RD, LDN, a Boston-based registered dietitian. These nutrients combine to support muscle, tissue, bone, heart, immune, gut, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/foods-that-boost-metabolism" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And given that Greek yogurt is &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/popular-ingredients/cheese-can-eat-lactose-intolerant" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower in lactose&lt;/a&gt; than regular yogurt, it may be an especially smart choice for those sensitive to lactose. “For my patients who are lactose intolerant, Greek yogurt is also a safer option when testing tolerance with yogurt, since it tends to be lower in lactose than milk, regular yogurt, and even ice cream,” shares Baham. “Plus, the live and active cultures in Greek yogurt help further break down the lactose&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, making it even easier to digest.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Maybe the only concern surrounding this dairy product is its saturated fat content. While some research&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; shows full-fat dairy, like yogurt, to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be linked to higher cholesterol or heart disease risk, other studies tie saturated fat to increased cholesterol levels&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, in turn upping cardiovascular disease risk. However, the &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/fermented-foods-8783423" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fermentation process&lt;/a&gt; involved in Greek yogurt (and cottage cheese) thankfully converts some of its saturated fat&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; into &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-fats-8740244" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;heart-healthy unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt;, further quelling this concern.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Fermented dairy&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, like Greek yogurt, has been associated with benefits for bone, metabolic, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-for-immune-system-7093660" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;immune health&lt;/a&gt;,” McGowan concludes.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ever trendy on social media, many of us likely are pretty familiar with cottage cheese. However, if you’re not, “cottage cheese is a soft, fresh cheese made from curdled milk,” explains McGowan. “It’s made by acidifying milk, which separates the whey from the curds,” Baham adds, with those curds going on to become cottage cheese.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s a closer look at cottage cheese nutrition, according to the USDA&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Plain Cottage Cheese, Full Fat (100 grams, around ½ cup)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Macronutrients&lt;br&gt;Calories: &lt;/strong&gt;105 calories&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Protein: &lt;/strong&gt;12 grams (g)&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Total Carbohydrates: &lt;/strong&gt;5 g&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fat: &lt;/strong&gt;4.2 g&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Saturated Fat: &lt;/strong&gt;2.6 g
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Micronutrients&lt;br&gt;Riboflavin (Vitamin B2):&lt;/strong&gt; 0.16mg, 13% DV&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vitamin B12: &lt;/strong&gt;0.7 micrograms (mcg), 29% DV&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vitamin A: &lt;/strong&gt;36 mcg, 5% DV&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Calcium:&lt;/strong&gt; 88 mg, 9% DV&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zinc: &lt;/strong&gt;0.45 mg, 5% DV&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phosphorus:&lt;/strong&gt; 154 mg, 12% DV&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Selenium:&lt;/strong&gt; 9.7 mcg, 18% DV&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sodium:&lt;/strong&gt; 350 mg, 18% DV
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Certain brands of cottage cheese also contain digestion-supporting probiotics—but not all of them. “Generally, cottage cheese is rich in casein—a slow-digesting protein that helps with satiety and muscle repair—and provides calcium, selenium, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/vitamin-b-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;B vitamins,&lt;/a&gt;” shares McGowan. Speaking of B vitamins, “this protein-packed dairy food is also a great source of riboflavin (B2), which plays a key &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/food/antioxidant-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;antioxidant&lt;/a&gt; role in reducing cell damage&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,” Baham adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, cottage cheese is pretty darn similar to Greek yogurt in terms of health benefits. “Like Greek yogurt, it’s a nutrient-dense, high-protein option that can support &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-foods-for-bone-health-7495764" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bone health&lt;/a&gt; and weight management,” McGowan summarizes—alongside championing energy metabolism and gut, heart, and immune health.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-which-dairy-product-is-better-for-you"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Which Dairy Product Is Better for You? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But this brings us to the question, which of these dairy products is actually better for you?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the numbers are very similar, Greek yogurt offers slightly more micronutrients pretty much across the board compared to cottage cheese, with the exception of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-phosphorus-7567264" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;phosphorus&lt;/a&gt; and sodium. It’s also slightly lower in calories, a more reliable source of probiotics, and generally lower in lactose. There’s virtually no difference between the fat and saturated fat content of the two dairy products.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The sodium in cottage cheese, however, is not to be overlooked, as one small half cup serving provides almost a fifth of your daily allowance of the mineral—and most of us eat more than half a cup in one sitting. While cottage cheese might be the only high-sodium food one has in a day, that’s often not the case—and prolonged &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-foods-high-in-sodium-7564072" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excessive sodium intake&lt;/a&gt; can lead to elevated blood pressure levels over time. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But when deciding which of the two is the better &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-protein-snacks-keep-you-energized-longer-than-granola-bar-11761162" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;high-protein&lt;/em&gt; snack&lt;/a&gt;, cottage cheese technically wins, as it boasts three more grams per serving. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, they’re both excellent choices that offer &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/high-protein-cheeses-recipes" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, calcium, and a range of other beneficial micronutrients. “‘Better’ really depends on the individual and their specific health goals,” Baham agrees. “If you’re trying to reduce your protein intake—like in the case of chronic kidney disease, for example—a dollop of Greek yogurt will be lower in protein than a dollop of cottage cheese. If you’re trying to increase your calcium intake, Greek yogurt tends to be higher per serving than cottage cheese,” she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Taste preference plays a role here, too. “It also comes down to what you enjoy. Greek yogurt contains probiotics and has a tangy, smooth texture, while cottage cheese offers a milder taste and chunkier consistency,” says McGowan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regardless of which dairy option you choose, plain varieties are always the best picks to avoid sneaky pro-inflammatory added sugars&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Also be sure to look for cottage cheese that contains &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/what-is-a-probiotic" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt; (usually advertised on the packaging).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With your plain Greek yogurt and cottage cheese, the culinary possibilities are nearly endless. “I love adding Greek yogurt to boost the probiotics and protein in my &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/heathy-breakfast-smoothies" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;smoothies&lt;/a&gt;, or using it as a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/browse-all-recipes/sour-cream" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;substitute for sour cream&lt;/a&gt; or mayo in my homemade dressings, whereas I like to use cottage cheese in both savory and sweet dishes like tasty dips, fluffy pancakes, and even homemade ice cream to reduce fat and added sugars,” shares Baham.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Meanwhile, McGowan loves “adding fruit, nuts, a drizzle of honey or maple syrup, or spices like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/cinnamon-benefits" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cinnamon&lt;/a&gt; or Everything Bagel seasoning for extra flavor to either Greek yogurt or cottage cheese.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the end of the day, it’s hard to go wrong with either dairy choice, as both Greek yogurt and cottage cheese offer a range of beneficial nutrients and satiating protein, sure to keep you energized throughout the day.&lt;br&gt;

In people with &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hypertension" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, adding 1,000 daily steps lowered overall death risk by 9% and heart‑related death risk by 8% in a twelve‑year U.S. cohort study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists call those outcomes reductions in &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/all-cause-mortality" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;all‑cause mortality&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10809869/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular mortality&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found little extra benefit above 8,250 steps for overall survival and 9,700 for heart health, a range well under the folklore goal of 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those numbers echo a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2734709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2019 trial&lt;/a&gt; of older women in which 7,500 steps delivered the same survival edge as 10,000. Led by &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/i-min-lee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. I‑Min Lee&lt;/a&gt; of Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, this research supported the idea that most people can stop chasing ever‑higher counts once they reach a moderate plateau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The simple message could perhaps be refined to, ‘Some stepping is good. More is better, up to a certain point,’” said Lee, explaining that health gains plateau after that range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea dates back to 1965, when a Japanese pedometer maker coined “&lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/Mythbusting-The-10000-Steps-Per-Day-Trend.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Manpo‑kei&lt;/a&gt;,” or 10,000‑step meter, as a catchy slogan rather than a physiologic milestone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-finding-the-sweet-spot"&gt;Finding the sweet spot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitting 8,000 to 9,700 steps translates to about 3.8 to 4.8 miles for an average adult stride. At that distance, energy expenditure lands near 300 to 400 calories, a figure the research team noted can help shave roughly one pound a week when paired with mindful eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.22171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;higher body weight&lt;/a&gt; tend to burn more calories per step, while lighter individuals may need more distance to match that burn. Either way, reaching the same calorie goals depends on stride length, walking pace, and overall effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same twelve‑year U.S. cohort study that pinpointed 8,250 steps showed risk curves flattening beyond that mark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers think the body’s major adaptations, better blood‑pressure control, improved insulin sensitivity, stronger leg muscles, occur early, then taper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than pushing for 15,000 steps, time‑pressed adults can focus on hitting the middle ground consistently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accumulating steps on two or three separate days each week still cut ten‑year &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2802810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;death risk&lt;/a&gt; by about fifteen percent in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/how-many-steps-a-day-health-benefits-7375335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-turning-healthy-steps-into-timelines"&gt;Turning healthy steps into timelines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple rule converts steps to distance: two thousand steps equal one mile for most people. Using that, 8,000 steps equal about four miles, which most folks cover in eighty minutes of leisurely walking or forty‑five minutes at a brisk clip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In pace terms, keeping conversation but not singing comfortably marks &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/japanese-interval-walking-training-technique-iwt-improves-health-prevents-disease/"&gt;moderate intensity&lt;/a&gt;. Heart‑rate monitors read roughly fifty to seventy percent of maximum during these walks, the sweet zone for cardiovascular conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who prefer time targets can aim for 150 minutes of moderate walking per week, the level in federal activity guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spread across seven days, that’s just over twenty minutes daily, slightly less than the time needed for 4,000 steps but far short of 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginner? Start slow. Build consistency first, then distance, per the implications of the findings. Once consistency feels easy, adding an extra block or two extends the workout without scheduling gymnastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-age-health-and-walking-distance"&gt;Age, health, and walking distance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age, baseline fitness, and chronic conditions shape the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/walking-can-counteract-the-health-risks-of-sitting/"&gt;ideal daily distance&lt;/a&gt;. People over sixty often see benefits plateau near 6,000 to 8,000 steps, according to the study mentioned earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, younger adults can climb to 10,000 before gains level off, according to Lee’s pooled analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight‑loss seekers may stretch walks beyond the plateau because calorie balance, not mortality curves, dictates fat loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bigger goals = longer walks,” an idea that underscores that cutting calories works best alongside extra movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those living with joint pain can still gain overall health benefits by combining short walks with cycling or water exercise to protect knees while keeping step counts modest. Smartwatches capture equivalent “active minutes,” ensuring effort registers even without heel strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical limits aside, the most reliable predictor of long‑term success is enjoyment. If neighborhood strolls bore you, shifting to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/outdoor-exercise-amplifies-physical-and-mental-health-benefits/"&gt;park trails&lt;/a&gt;, mall loops, or treadmill podcasts can supply variety without complicating the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-walking-yourself-better-health"&gt;Walking yourself better health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time scarcity derails many routines, but short bouts add up. The research &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/outdoor-exercise-amplifies-physical-and-mental-health-benefits/"&gt;offers a template&lt;/a&gt;: “Morning reset,” “Lunchtime stroll,” and “Evening unwind” sessions lasting ten to fifteen minutes each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skipping elevators for stairs, parking farther from the store, or pacing during phone calls collects hidden steps. A mile‑and‑a‑half grocery run with reusable bags in hand turns errands into strength training and step boosting at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking helps: pedometer apps reward mini‑wins and reveal idle stretches begging for micro‑walks. Celebrating streaks reinforces habit loops, a psychological trick as potent as any shoe technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, pairing walks with friends or pets injects accountability and pleasure. Social walkers often over‑shoot goals without noticing, a happy accident that health research fully supports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-024-21216-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 15:38:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPajhQU181bTNJeVd1dEI5aDlYdU5yZWotY3dYTDdfWkNlNWM2Ym13ZDB0b2JzY2pIT3NRcWh5bTVBSkhIUFdXZlZQSEczemd5andJWWpfZ0poNG9ZdzBMWGhYTGtoOW93VFBUTXJxbTRUZ2hkV3QycnlUTUtvV0FiaHdxMUVpSEpieDJSeE5kRXMxd3lO</guid></item><item><title>阳光对健康有哪些好处？ -《纽约时报》 | What are the Health Benefits of Sunshine? - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE1XcE1PcmVXV0JGdjBlTDloTENZbWtVX2pSM3Y0X3JpXzVMSXZwNzg0blJ2RkRFVjNRT3duenRqcXczaVBPVFAxM1M0UXBZR3pwT1FlX21mVC1UZ1QwZHp2LVp4SW1HUGJqSzBMWHR6MlM5dmpTbFFTUTBGNEFqUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 15:32:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE1XcE1PcmVXV0JGdjBlTDloTENZbWtVX2pSM3Y0X3JpXzVMSXZwNzg0blJ2RkRFVjNRT3duenRqcXczaVBPVFAxM1M0UXBZR3pwT1FlX21mVC1UZ1QwZHp2LVp4SW1HUGJqSzBMWHR6MlM5dmpTbFFTUTBGNEFqUQ</guid></item><item><title>诺华获批首款针对新生儿和婴儿的疟疾药物--路透社 | Novartis wins approval for first malaria drug for newborns and babies - Reuters</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNeVV1Qm1UcHdjbTJiRzc2NUJqb21ndTN5T3hjdVZ4N3k0UlNoQ2FmM2lWSXB6ZTU5eGIwTDBxaGVWQkhSYW5ZQTdDZmFaR2xIZ3MxeENxb291RDBHSVhQX2c1YjY5LWEtRXFhV3o1dmNzYWNRNXNBRFB6V3VXdThlc1hNR0VxSHpMWGZmbk9lUGxyRERtc2dYLVl6OXRDeDh5VWJVQ0hFRU51X2pUOHdkM2RQWU1QTXVKbFVXTk9YVXVDSlQ4eW9mSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 14:17:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNeVV1Qm1UcHdjbTJiRzc2NUJqb21ndTN5T3hjdVZ4N3k0UlNoQ2FmM2lWSXB6ZTU5eGIwTDBxaGVWQkhSYW5ZQTdDZmFaR2xIZ3MxeENxb291RDBHSVhQX2c1YjY5LWEtRXFhV3o1dmNzYWNRNXNBRFB6V3VXdThlc1hNR0VxSHpMWGZmbk9lUGxyRERtc2dYLVl6OXRDeDh5VWJVQ0hFRU51X2pUOHdkM2RQWU1QTXVKbFVXTk9YVXVDSlQ4eW9mSQ</guid></item><item><title>运动真的能改善心理健康吗？新的研究揭示了令人惊讶的事实-研究发现 | Does Exercise Really Improve Mental Health?

&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-octonary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New research highlights that the link between exercise and mental health is more complex than widely believed.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Leisure-time activities like sports or gym workouts are consistently linked to lower depression and anxiety, but work-related or household chores may not provide the same benefit, and can sometimes correlate with worse outcomes for some groups.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Placebo effects and contextual factors, like group settings or supportive programs, play a huge role in whether exercise helps.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The authors argue that while exercise can help, it won’t fix the broader social and economic drivers of mental health issues on its own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ATHENS, Ga. —&lt;/strong&gt; For decades, the prescription has been simple: feeling down? Hit the gym. Stressed? Go for a run. Depression got you down? Start lifting weights. But new research from top universities is turning this conventional wisdom on its head, revealing that the relationship between exercise and mental health is far more complicated than anyone imagined.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A major study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/abstract/2025/05000/up_for_debate__does_regular_physical_activity.17.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports &amp;amp; Exercise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; found that while exercise does benefit mental health, the effects are often smaller than expected and may be largely due to placebo responses. Even more surprising: certain types of physical activity, such &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/chores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;household chores&lt;/a&gt; or work-related movement, might not provide the same mental health benefits, and in some cases may even be linked to worse outcomes for certain groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team noted that “&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/exercise-mental-health-drugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health benefits of exercise&lt;/a&gt; may be partially a placebo response or result from contextual factors surrounding exercise programs.” This revelation comes as America grapples with a mental health crisis, with 10% of adults and 20% of teens experiencing depression annually.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For example, if a &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/soccer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;soccer player&lt;/a&gt; runs down the field and kicks the game-winning ball, their mental health is fantastic,” said co-author Patrick O’Connor, of the University of Georgia, in a statement. “In contrast, if you do the exact same exercise but miss the goal and people are blaming you, you likely feel very differently. Anecdotes such as these show how context matters even when people are performing a similar exercise dose.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-exercise-equity-gap-nobody-talks-about"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Exercise Equity Gap Nobody Talks About&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study revealed a troubling disparity in who actually benefits from physical activity. Large-scale population studies consistently show that people who engage in recreational exercise — sports, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/hiking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hiking&lt;/a&gt;, gym workouts — report lower rates of depression and anxiety. But this advantage doesn’t extend to other forms of movement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Latino adults in the United States have the highest overall physical activity levels when measured by &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/fitness-trackers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fitness trackers&lt;/a&gt;, but most of it comes from manual labor jobs rather than leisure activities. Despite being the most physically active group, they have the lowest rates of recreational exercise among all ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This creates what researchers describe as a potential equity problem. People who lack time, money, or safe access to recreational facilities are told to exercise more while receiving little psychological benefit from their existing physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-placebo-effect-problem"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Placebo Effect Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials present an even more complex picture. While &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hundreds of studies&lt;/a&gt; show exercise can improve mental health symptoms, they suffer from a fundamental flaw: participants always know whether they’re exercising or sitting still.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike drug studies where patients receive identical-looking pills, it’s impossible to hide whether someone is running on a treadmill or doing nothing. This creates what researchers call “outcome expectations,” which is when people expect exercise to help because that’s what they’ve been told their entire lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one analysis examining &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/adhd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ADHD symptoms&lt;/a&gt; in children, researchers estimated that roughly half of exercise’s benefits came from the activity itself, while the other half stemmed from contextual factors like behavior management programs. When researchers compared exercise programs to equally engaging activities like arts and crafts, the mental health advantages of exercise often disappeared or shrank dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most exercise studies also fall short of medical research standards, lasting less than six months with fewer than 100 participants, while FDA guidelines recommend following 100–300 people for up to two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-context-matters-more-than-cardio"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context Matters More Than Cardio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most eye-opening discovery involves how, where, and with whom people exercise. Studies of children with ADHD found that physical activity programs only worked after researchers added psychological interventions like behavior management and reward systems — treatments that reduce ADHD symptoms on their own.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;College students participating in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/children-team-sports-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;group sports&lt;/a&gt; showed better mental health than solo exercisers, regardless of how much they actually moved. After-school programs with better-trained staff produced superior mental health outcomes in children, independent of the physical activities involved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several studies also revealed a “U-shaped” relationship between exercise and mental health: &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/exercise-50s-prevent-alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;some activity beats none&lt;/a&gt;, but extremely high levels can actually worsen psychological outcomes. This pattern appeared across depression, anxiety, and other mental health measures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rethinking-exercise-as-mental-health-medicine"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rethinking Exercise as Mental Health Medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team argues that treating exercise as a mental health cure-all distracts from addressing America’s real psychological wellness crisis. Social factors like economic stability, housing security, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/healthcare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthcare access&lt;/a&gt; likely matter much more than individual exercise habits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the researchers put it: “Just as physical inactivity did not cause a mental health crisis of this magnitude, neither will physical activity solve our mental health crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mental health&lt;/a&gt; professionals routinely prescribe exercise, insurance companies promote gym memberships as wellness benefits, and public health campaigns encourage physical activity as a psychological solution. But if household chores, work movement, and commuting don’t provide the same benefits as leisure exercise, these recommendations may miss the mark entirely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest recognizing that context matters enormously &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;when it comes to exercise&lt;/a&gt;; not all physical activity provides equal benefits, and exercise works best as part of comprehensive mental health strategies rather than a standalone fix. Rather than abandoning exercise entirely, understanding its limitations may be key to unlocking its true potential for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/psychological/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;psychological wellness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted a comprehensive review examining physical activity and mental health from three angles. They analyzed published studies and searched three major databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO) from 2018-2023, reviewing 710 abstracts. The team examined different types of physical activity (leisure, work, transportation, household) and evaluated existing research on exercise interventions and contextual factors that influence mental health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leisure-time physical activity consistently linked to reduced depression, anxiety, and dementia risk in large population studies. However, evidence for mental health benefits from work, transportation, or household physical activity was limited or mixed. Clinical trials supported exercise benefits but showed small effect sizes, especially in healthy populations. Approximately half of exercise’s mental health benefits may be due to placebo effects. Contextual factors like social environment and program quality significantly influenced outcomes independent of physical activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most exercise studies were too small (under 100 participants) and short (under 6 months) for reliable conclusions. Participants can’t be blinded to exercise interventions, creating bias from expectations. Publication bias favors positive results. Research primarily focused on white, higher-income populations, limiting broader applicability. Studies often failed to account for contextual factors beyond physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h3&gt;

Sugar-sweetened beverages like sodas led to an 8 percent higher risk of type 2 diabetes and a 2 percent higher risk of heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The researchers stressed that more research is needed, but say the findings only add to the growing recommendations that people cut back on their ultra-processed food intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-considered-ultra-processed" data-node-id="11" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.0"&gt;What is considered “ultra-processed”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The level of processing that food undergoes before it ends up on our table is classified by a system known as the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224421004970#" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224421004970#" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="NOVA scale" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;NOVA scale&lt;/a&gt;.

For starters, UPFs are linked with a higher risk of developing serious health issues like heart disease and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19850497/colon-cancer-survivor-stupid-cancer-cancercon/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19850497/colon-cancer-survivor-stupid-cancer-cancercon/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="colorectal cancer" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and having those conditions raises your risk of early death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It's likely related to inflammation, says Keri Gans, RDN, author of &lt;em data-node-id="16.1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Small-Change-Diet-Thinner-Healthier/dp/145160890X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=womenshealth-auto-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.63975057%5Bsrc%7Cwww.google.com%5Bch%7C%5Blt%7Csale%5Bpid%7Cbe2a9af4-c004-45e6-8580-ba1f7f582197%5Baxid%7Cd0ea1d71-8b32-4622-8710-eb9018bbe27b" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.amazon.com/Small-Change-Diet-Thinner-Healthier/dp/145160890X" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Small Change Diet" data-node-id="16.1.0" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Small-Change-Diet-Thinner-Healthier/dp/145160890X" data-product-url="https://www.amazon.com/Small-Change-Diet-Thinner-Healthier/dp/145160890X" data-affiliate="true" data-affiliate-url="https://www.amazon.com/Small-Change-Diet-Thinner-Healthier/dp/145160890X?tag=womenshealth-auto-20" data-affiliate-network='{"site_id":"6b499c58-dc46-4f93-80b3-25265395e77a","metadata":{"links":{"default":"https://www.amazon.com/Small-Change-Diet-Thinner-Healthier/dp/145160890X?tag=womenshealth-auto-20","sem":"https://www.amazon.com/Small-Change-Diet-Thinner-Healthier/dp/145160890X?tag=wh-lift-20","social":"https://www.amazon.com/Small-Change-Diet-Thinner-Healthier/dp/145160890X?tag=wh-soc-lift-20"}},"network":{"name":"Amazon"},"product_metadata":null,"afflink_redirect":"/_p/afflink/rzqk/amazon"}' data-vars-ga-product-brand="amazon.com" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="9de8c213-e8b5-4361-8b92-827e3cbe7093" data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="amazon.com" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="sale | (not set)" data-vars-ga-axid="d0ea1d71-8b32-4622-8710-eb9018bbe27b" data-amazon-ascsubtag="[artid|2140.a.63975057[src|www.google.com[ch|[lt|sale[pid|be2a9af4-c004-45e6-8580-ba1f7f582197[axid|d0ea1d71-8b32-4622-8710-eb9018bbe27b" data-aps-asc-tag="womenshealth-auto-20" data-aps-asc-subtag="[artid|2140.a.63975057[src|www.google.com[ch|[lt|sale[pid|be2a9af4-c004-45e6-8580-ba1f7f582197[axid|d0ea1d71-8b32-4622-8710-eb9018bbe27b" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;The Small Change Diet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="16.2"&gt;. “&lt;/em&gt;Diets rich in ultra-processed foods may cause inflammation in the body, which over time may increase the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and other serious health issues that can reduce your lifespan,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-are-ultra-processed-food-bad-for-your-health-and-heart-health" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;Why are ultra-processed food bad for your health and heart health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;There are a few reasons why these foods aren’t great for your heart. “Ultra-processed foods are often high in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium, which may increase blood pressure, LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, and inflammation, all key risk factors for heart disease,” Gans says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But eating a lot of UPFs also means that you’re likely crowding out healthier choices, Cording points out. “If someone is eating a lot of ultra-processed foods that don’t offer much in the way of important vitamins and minerals, and over-consuming sugar, preservatives, and empty calories, it can set someone up for adverse health issues,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-can-i-cut-out-ultra-processed-foods-from-my-diet" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;How can I cut out ultra-processed foods from my diet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This food category is quite broad and includes things like bars and protein powders, along with stuff people typically think of, like hot dogs and sodas. While dietitians stress that whole foods are best, Cording says you don’t need to freak if you grab the odd bar to tide you over until dinner. “It’s really the overall diet pattern that matters,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Still, if you’d prefer to cut out or cut down on UPFs in your life, Gans recommends filling your plate with whole foods first. “Focus on eating more whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and lean proteins, which naturally leave less room for ultra-processed ones,” she says. Reading ingredients lists is also helpful, Gans adds. “Look for lengthy lists that include added sugars, saturated fats, and excessive sodium,” she suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The experts also know that it's difficult to be perfect here. “You don’t have to cut everything out, but being mindful helps,” she says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1y37fga ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in moderation, consumption of ultra-processed foods is linked with measurable increases in risk for chronic diseases, according to research from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. Processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), and trans fatty acids (TFAs) were associated with an increased disease risk, such as type 2 diabetes, ischemic heart disease (IHD), and colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Multiple previous studies have linked ultra-processed foods, particularly processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, and trans fatty acids, with elevated chronic disease risks. Estimates suggest that diets high in processed meat contributed to nearly 300,000 deaths worldwide in 2021, while diets rich in sugar-sweetened beverages and trans fats accounted for millions of disability-adjusted life years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processed meats preserved through smoking, curing or chemical additives often contain compounds such as N-nitroso agents, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/polycyclic+aromatic+hydrocarbons/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons&lt;/a&gt; and heterocyclic amines—compounds implicated in tumor development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugar-sweetened beverages remain the primary dietary source of added sugars in many populations, contributing to weight gain, cardiovascular disease and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/diabetes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; risk. Artificial trans fats, created to solidify &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/vegetable+oils/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vegetable oils&lt;/a&gt;, have been associated with systemic inflammation and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/coronary+heart+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;coronary heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clarity about dose-response relationships has been limited by variability in data availability and inconsistent findings across studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Health effects associated with consumption of processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages and trans fatty acids: a Burden of Proof study," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03775-8" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, researchers applied Burden of Proof meta-regression methods to evaluate the associations between processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages and trans &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/fatty+acids/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; and the risk of type 2 diabetes, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/ischemic+heart+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;ischemic heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For processed meat and type 2 diabetes, the analysis included 15 cohort studies and one nested case-control study, representing 1,115,885 participants and 64,607 diabetes events. Processed meat and IHD analyses incorporated 11 cohort studies with 1,173,821 participants and 31,549 IHD events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For colorectal cancer, 18 cohort studies contributed data on 2,678,052 participants and 30,259 cancer events. Analyses of sugar-sweetened beverages included 19 studies comprising 563,444 participants and 39,505 diabetes events, and eight studies with 961,176 participants and 24,542 IHD events. Trans fat and IHD analyses incorporated six cohort studies with 226,509 participants and 12,548 events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/meat+consumption/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;meat consumption&lt;/a&gt; between 0.6 grams per day and 57 grams per day was associated with at least an 11% higher average risk of type 2 diabetes compared with no consumption. Relative risk of developing type 2 diabetes was estimated at 1.30 at a daily intake of 50 grams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumption between 0.78 grams per day and 55 grams per day was associated with a 7% higher average risk of colorectal cancer. Relative risk of colorectal cancer was estimated at 1.26 at 50 grams per day intake. Relative risk of IHD was estimated at 1.15 at 50 grams per day intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugar-sweetened beverage intake between 1.5 grams per day and 390 grams per day was associated with at least an 8% higher average risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Relative risk of type 2 diabetes was estimated at 1.20 at 250 grams per day consumption. Intake between 0 grams per day and 365 grams per day was associated with a 2% higher average risk of IHD. Relative risk of IHD was estimated at 1.07 at 250 grams per day consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trans fatty acid consumption between 0.25% and 2.56% of daily energy intake was associated with at least a 3% higher average risk of IHD. Relative risk of IHD was estimated at 1.11 at 1% daily energy intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk increased continuously at every level of consumption, with the steepest increases occurring at low habitual intake, approximately equivalent to one serving or less daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers conclude that these conservative estimates support existing public-health recommendations urging reductions in consumption of processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages and industrial trans fats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the global burden of diabetes, heart disease and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/colorectal+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;, the findings reinforce WHO initiatives including bans on industrial trans fats and taxes on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sugar-sweetened+beverages/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sugar-sweetened beverages&lt;/a&gt;. The study authors note that even low habitual intake levels could pose measurable risks.&lt;/p&gt;
