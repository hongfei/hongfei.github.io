      &lt;p&gt;WILLISTON, N.D. — North Dakota has reported its first case of measles in more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unvaccinated child from Williams County contracted the virus, likely during an out-of-state visit, according to a news release the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services issued Friday evening, May 2. &lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;The child has been isolated at home, HHS said, but the agency didn’t disclose the child’s name, age or condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“HHS is contacting those who may have been exposed and advising unvaccinated individuals how long to quarantine,” the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a contagious viral illness that was once common among children. The virus can lead to serious and deadly symptoms in young children and those with compromised immune systems, HHS said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include a fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation and a body-wide rash, the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anyone with symptoms consistent with measles should call ahead before visiting a clinic to avoid exposing others,” HHS Immunization Director Molly Howell said in a statement. “Vaccination remains the most effective defense against measles. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination is safer than risking measles illness. The MMR vaccine has been safely used in the United States since 1973.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illness spreads through the air and is contagious for several days before and after signs appear, HHS said. Most people recover after 10 days of being infected, according to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no specific medical treatment for measles, antibiotics may be used in cases that have a developed secondary bacterial infection,” North Dakota HHS said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, thanks to a “highly effective vaccination program” in the country, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Texas has reported an outbreak, where more than two-thirds of the country’s 935 confirmed cases have been reported, the CDC reported Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 70% of the cases were reported in patients 19 years old and younger, the CDC said. Three people have died and 121 have been hospitalized, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has, in general, questioned the safety and effectiveness of vaccinations. Last month, he said on the social media platform X that the MMR vaccine is the "most effective way to prevent the spread of measles."&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;North Dakota’s case is the first reported since 2011. Minnesota reported its 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.inforum.com/health/doctor-urges-residents-to-check-measles-vaccination-status-after-confirmed-case-in-minnesota" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;first case of the year in March.&lt;/a&gt;
    
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Dakota has a high vaccination rate, with 81% among toddlers and 90% in kindergarten students, according to North Dakota HHS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“According to public health data, a 95% vaccination rate is generally needed to prevent wider spread in communities,” HHS said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state said two doses of the MMR vaccine is 97% effective in preventing infection.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;“The vaccine is routinely recommended for children at 12-15 months of age and again between 4-6 years,” the release said. “Most adults born in 1957 or later should have at least one documented dose. People born before 1957 are assumed to be immune due to the history of measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state advised families and patients to consult with health care providers on the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;

I didn't want to miss work," he told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mr Friede's motivation was to develop better therapies for the rest of the world, explaining: "It just became a lifestyle and I just kept pushing and pushing and pushing as hard as I could push - for the people who are 8,000 miles away from me who die from snakebite".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;'I'd love to get my hands on some of your blood'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Antivenom is currently made by injecting small doses of snake venom into animals, such as horses. Their immune system fights the venom by producing antibodies and these are harvested to be used as a therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But venom and antivenom have to be closely matched because the toxins in a venomous bite vary from one species to another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There is even wide variety within the same species – antivenom made from snakes in India &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97501-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;is less effective&lt;/a&gt; against the same species in Sri Lanka. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A team of researchers began searching for a type of immune defence called broadly neutralising antibodies. Instead of targeting the part of a toxin that makes it unique, they target the parts that are common to entire classes of toxin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That's when Dr Jacob Glanville, chief executive of biotech company Centivax, came across Tim Friede.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Immediately I was like 'if anybody in the world has developed these broadly neutralising antibodies, it's going to be him' and so I reached out," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The first call, I was like 'this might be awkward, but I'd love to get my hands on some of your blood'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mr Friede agreed and the work was given ethical approval because the study would only take blood, rather than giving him more venom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250428-123652-7bc49a8f4-web-2.20.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ae2e/live/9d6cfae0-2774-11f0-af09-190ae4e2fe1c.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ae2e/live/9d6cfae0-2774-11f0-af09-190ae4e2fe1c.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ae2e/live/9d6cfae0-2774-11f0-af09-190ae4e2fe1c.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ae2e/live/9d6cfae0-2774-11f0-af09-190ae4e2fe1c.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ae2e/live/9d6cfae0-2774-11f0-af09-190ae4e2fe1c.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ae2e/live/9d6cfae0-2774-11f0-af09-190ae4e2fe1c.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ae2e/live/9d6cfae0-2774-11f0-af09-190ae4e2fe1c.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ae2e/live/9d6cfae0-2774-11f0-af09-190ae4e2fe1c.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Jacob Glanville Tim Friede in a lab coat stands in the middle of a busy laboratory where four other researchers are working" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Jacob Glanville&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Tim Friede, centre, wanted to help develop better therapies for snakebite victims&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The research focused on elapids – one of the two families of venomous snakes – such as coral snakes, mambas, cobras, taipans and kraits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Elapids primarily use neurotoxins in their venom, which paralyses their victim and is fatal when it stops the muscles needed to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Researchers picked 19 elapids identified by the World Health Organization as being among the deadliest snakes on the planet. They then began scouring Mr Friede's blood for protective defences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Their work, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)00402-7" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;detailed in the journal Cell&lt;/a&gt;, identified two broadly neutralising antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxin. They added in a drug that targets a third to make their antivenom cocktail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In experiments on mice, the cocktail meant the animals survived fatal doses from 13 of the 19 species of venomous snake. They had partial protection against the remaining six.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is "unparalleled" breadth of protection, according to Dr Glanville, who said it "likely covers a whole bunch of elapids for which there is no current antivenom".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250428-123652-7bc49a8f4-web-2.20.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/abcf/live/faf013e0-2775-11f0-9ade-51d827e59e40.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/abcf/live/faf013e0-2775-11f0-9ade-51d827e59e40.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/abcf/live/faf013e0-2775-11f0-9ade-51d827e59e40.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/abcf/live/faf013e0-2775-11f0-9ade-51d827e59e40.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/abcf/live/faf013e0-2775-11f0-9ade-51d827e59e40.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/abcf/live/faf013e0-2775-11f0-9ade-51d827e59e40.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/abcf/live/faf013e0-2775-11f0-9ade-51d827e59e40.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/abcf/live/faf013e0-2775-11f0-9ade-51d827e59e40.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Jacob Glanville Two scientists wearing white lab coats and black gloves are pipetting into small vials in a laboratory " class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Jacob Glanville&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Researchers working on developing a universal antivenom&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The team is trying to refine the antibodies further and see if adding a fourth component could lead to total protection against elapid snake venom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The other class of snake – the vipers – rely more on haemotoxins, which attack the blood, rather than neurotoxins. In total there are around a dozen broad classes of toxin in snake venom, which also includes cytotoxins that directly kill cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I think in the next 10 or 15 years we'll have something effective against each one of those toxin classes," said Prof Peter Kwong, one of the researchers at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And the hunt continues inside Mr Friede's blood samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Tim's antibodies are really quite extraordinary - he taught his immune system to get this very, very broad recognition," said Prof Kwong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The ultimate hope is to have either a single antivenom that can do everything, or one injection for elapids and one for vipers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Nick Casewell, who is the head of the centre for snakebite research and interventions at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said the breadth of protection reported was "certainly novel" and provided "a strong piece of evidence" that this was a feasible approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There is no doubt that this work moves the field forwards in an exciting direction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But he cautioned there was "much work to do" and that the antivenom still needed extensive testing before it could be used in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But for Mr Friede, reaching this stage "makes me feel good".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I'm doing something good for humanity and that was very important to me.

She listed the medicine in the caption and how her bloated lip was “one of the side effects” of Lisinopril. “I wish I could make this up. I can’t,” she said while shaking her head. The comments, nearly 20K of them, shared similar sentiments about the medication and how it’s “NOT for most of us Black folks and to “stop taking it ASAP.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"&gt;“The same thing happened to me when I was taking that medication. They need to take Lisinopril off the market,” one comment read. Others included, “I’m still traumatized from my allergic reaction to Lisinopril! That stuff will literally take our lives,” “Eastern medicine please 😩😩😩 cause Western ain’t it,” and “Lisinopril allergy is dangerous and can be fatal so beware.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"&gt;Some folks in the comments reasoned SassyJ was having  an allergic reaction, and not a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"&gt;Dr. Rubin, MD, a board certified allergist, stitched SassyJ’s video to explain exactly how something like that could happen. After apologizing to the woman, he explained how her lip swell is “not considered an allergic reaction because your immune system is not really involved with it the same way that you think of other types of allergic reactions.” He added: “This is considered a side effect for the following reason: Lisinopril [...] releases an enzyme that causes your blood vessels to get leaky. So when you take it... there’s an increased risk in some individuals for fluid to leak out of your blood vessels and cause swelling like that.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"&gt;The side effect has seemingly been effecting Black people for an extended period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"&gt;Back in October 2024, TikToker @VM posted a clip from a hospital bed with a swollen bottom lip. “Looky here, looky here. This is a side effect to the medication... this mostly impacts African Americans,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"&gt;Rewind back to 2021, another TikToker described how she had been “taking Lisinopril for about a month. Started on 10mg, then 20mg, now I’m on 40mg,” before removing her mask and showing her fattened lip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"&gt;Another social media user shared her experience online and how the doctor said her swollen lip “was getting worse. They gonna keep me here and they said I can’t eat nothing.” She documented herself being taken to the progressive care unit — which is one step below the intensive care unit (ICU) — and told viewers how “she’s in good spirits but this is nothing to play with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"&gt;Aside from swollen lips, Dr. Nneka Anuligo, MD shared a TikTok of her own describing the “life threatening side effect of Lisinopril.” Because the drug can cause swelling of the “tongue, and sometimes the throat” that can “lead to closure of the airway.” She described how “it’s a rare side effect,” but “African Americans are five times more likely to have this side effect, however, it does not preclude African Americans from taking this excellent medication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-77igqf-0 fnnahv"&gt;AstraZeneca, the primary maker of Lisinopril, has addressed the side effects of their medication with &lt;span&gt;&lt;a class="sc-1out364-0 dPMosf sc-145m8ut-0 kMzRIQ js_link" data-ga='[["Embedded Url","External link","https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/019777s064lbl.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com",{"metric25":1}]]' href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/019777s064lbl.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;clear warnings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.

The NTS, a vital relay for signals from organs via the vagus nerve, plays a key role in emotion regulation and overall mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using D-PSCAN, scientists visualized how the NTS responds to vagus nerve stimulation and natural signals like the gut hormone cholecystokinin. This breakthrough could help optimize treatments like vagus nerve stimulation for depression and broaden our understanding of brain-body interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Deep-Brain Imaging:&lt;/strong&gt; D-PSCAN enables minimally invasive, high-resolution imaging of the NTS in living animals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain-Body Communication:&lt;/strong&gt; The NTS integrates organ signals and plays a vital role in emotion regulation and mental health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could optimize vagus nerve stimulation and inform treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;NINS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The communication between the brain and bodily organs is fundamental to emotion regulation and overall mental health. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) in the brainstem is a critical hub structure mediating this interaction via the vagus nerve.

Therefore, a method to observe the NTS while preserving cerebellar function has been needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detailed activity of the NTS can now be observed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team evaluated the D-PSCAN method by investigating the NTS’s response to the electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve, which conveys signals from internal organs to the NTS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They observed the specific thresholds of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) intensity required to elicit neural responses in the NTS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also observed that varying stimulation parameters causes distinct patterns of neural activation, including sensitization or, conversely, inhibitory effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been clinically used for drug-resistant epilepsy and is currently under investigation as a treatment for depression and other psychiatric and neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, these results highlight the potential of the D-PSCAN method for gaining valuable insights into optimizing VNS parameters for therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further investigate NTS function under more physiological conditions than electrical stimulation, the research team applied the D-PSCAN method to examine its response to the gut hormone cholecystokinin, which is naturally released after feeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, they successfully detected NTS neural activity evoked by cholecystokinin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future prospects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brain-body interaction plays a critical role in emotion regulation, and gaining a deeper understanding of this function is expected to contribute both to the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders and to the advancement of mental health and well-being.” says Agetsuma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The D-PSCAN can offer a new approach to elucidate brain–body–mind interactions, and represents a valuable research tool for basic neuroscience to clinical applications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications of this research extend beyond the study of emotion regulation. The NTS receives input from various organs, including the heart and gut, and is involved in diverse functions such as appetite regulation, energy metabolism, and gut microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The in vivo NTS imaging technique developed in this study, D-PSCAN, is expected to be widely applied across these research areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2c4245425f01474347595f4d456c4245425f02465c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hayao KIMURA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nins.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NINS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Hayao KIMURA – NINS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crmeth.2025.101010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Minimally invasive, wide-field two-photon imaging of the brainstem at cellular resolution&lt;/a&gt;” by Masakazu Agetsuma et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimally invasive, wide-field two-photon imaging of the brainstem at cellular resolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), a brainstem structure, is proposed as a critical gateway for regulating emotions through brain-viscera communication and for therapies based on vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). However, how the NTS processes signals from various organs remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigating this has been challenging due to the NTS’s deep location beneath the cerebellum and its being surrounded by brainstem regions critical to vital functions, which makes direct observation difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this issue, we developed an &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; two-photon imaging method using a double-prism-based optical interface, allowing minimally invasive observation while keeping the surrounding regions mostly intact.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 20:30:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE1kWUpsbkMzUkVkVDVqb2JmbEh6Yi1PUjVpa2REQzlqUGx4U2tVdjhsdTR1WU5pb2ZTdkhSY2daampRQV9LZDhZNHNWdFQ3UVZHb0lvc3VKSEt4YXJWUjdfZGpFZjBISTI5bFJUNFFB</guid></item><item><title>视觉神经元如何实时适应-神经科学新闻 | How Visual Neurons Adapt in Real Time - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE9jOG1aWmhhQUtxQ3FDc2NySzd5bDVHcEtUYmtLUE42WUpTUnd4VVBMOFNiZ1VBekg1eHREd0M3NXFLb3ZlRWM5eDFmZHBncl9JX1ZDbl9RNnMwR0d5LV9TWkx4U3RIRzlvcndlWW9yYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research reveals that neurons in the visual cortex are far more adaptable than previously thought, responding dynamically to complex stimuli during object recognition tasks. While visual processing has traditionally been viewed as mostly feedforward, this study shows that feedback from higher brain areas conveys prior knowledge and behavioral context to shape perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This “top-down” information allows early visual neurons to shift their responsiveness moment by moment depending on the task at hand. These findings challenge classical models of visual processing and may have implications for understanding perception and brain disorders like autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Neurons:&lt;/strong&gt; Early visual neurons adapt rapidly based on task demands and prior experiences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top-Down Feedback:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher brain regions send contextual information to lower visual areas, guiding perception.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Autism:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding feedback mechanisms may shed light on perceptual differences in autism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Rockefeller University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our brains begin to create internal representations of the world around us from the first moment we open our eyes. We perceptually assemble components of scenes into recognizable objects thanks to neurons in the visual cortex.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process occurs along the ventral visual cortical pathway, which extends from the primary visual cortex at the back of the brain to the temporal lobes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s long been thought that specific neurons along this pathway handle specific types of information depending on where they are located, and that the dominant flow of visual information is feedforward, up a hierarchy of visual cortical areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109434"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing.jpg" alt="This shows a Brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/top-down-visual-processing-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The findings are part of an increasing recognition of the importance and prevalence of feedback information flow in the visual cortex—and perhaps far beyond. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the reverse direction of cortical connections, often referred to as feedback, has long been known to exist, its functional role has been little understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ongoing research from the lab of Rockefeller University’s Charles D. Gilbert is revealing an important role for feedback along the visual pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As his team demonstrates in a paper recently published in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, this countercurrent stream carries so-called “top down” information across cortical areas that is informed by our prior encounters with an object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One consequence of this flow is that neurons in this pathway aren’t fixed in their responsiveness but can adapt moment to moment to the information they’re receiving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even at the first stages of object perception, the neurons are sensitive to much more complex visual stimuli than had previously been believed, and that capability is informed by feedback from higher cortical areas,” says Gilbert, head of the Laboratory of Neurobiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A different flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gilbert’s lab has investigated fundamental aspects of how information is represented in the brain for many years, primarily by studying the circuitry underlying visual perception and perceptual learning in the visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The classical view of this pathway proposes that neurons at its beginning can only perceive simple information such as a line segment, and that complexity increases the farther up the hierarchy you go until you reach the neurons that will only respond to a specific level of complexity,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous findings from his lab indicate that this view may be incorrect. His group has, for example, found that the visual cortex is capable of altering its functional properties and circuitry, a quality known as plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in work done with his Rockefeller colleague (and Nobel Prize winner) Torsten N. Wiesel, Gilbert discovered long-range horizontal connections along cortical circuits, which enable neurons to link bits of information over much larger areas of the visual field than had been thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s also documented that neurons can switch their inputs between those that are task relevant and those that are task irrelevant, underscoring the dexterity of their functional properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the current study, we were trying to establish that these capabilities are part of our normal process of object recognition,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seeing is understanding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gilbert’s lab spent several years studying a pair of macaques that had been trained in object recognition using images of a variety of objects the animals may or may not have had familiarity with, such as fruits, vegetables, tools, and machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the animals learned to recognize these objects, the researchers monitored their brain activity using fMRI to identify which regions responded to the visual stimuli. (This method was pioneered by Gilbert’s Rockefeller colleague Winrich Freiwald, who has used it to identify regions of the brain that are responsive to faces.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then implanted electrode arrays, which enabled them to record the activity of individual nerve cells as the animals were shown images of the objects they’d been trained to recognize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes they were shown the full object, and other times a partial or tightly cropped image. Then they were shown a variety of different visual stimuli and indicated whether they found a match to the original object or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are called delayed match-to-sample tasks because there is a delay between when they see an object cue and when they are shown a second object or object component, to which they are trained to report whether the second image corresponds to the initial cue,” Gilbert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While they’re looking through all the visual stimuli to find a match, they have to use their working memory to keep in mind the original image.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive processing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that over a range of visual targets, a single neuron may be more responsive to one target, and with another cue, they’ll be more responsive to a different target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We learned these neurons are adaptive processors that change on a moment-to-moment basis, taking on different functions that are appropriate for the immediate behavioral context,” Gilbert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also demonstrated that the neurons found at the beginning of the pathway, thought to be limited to responding to simple visual information, were not actually so constrained in their abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These neurons are sensitive to much more complex visual stimuli than had previously been believed,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There doesn’t seem to be as large of a difference in terms of the degree of complexity represented in the early cortical areas relative to the higher cortical areas as previously thought.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings bolster what Gilbert believes is a novel view of cortical processing: that adult neurons do not have fixed functional properties but are instead dynamically tuned, changing their specificities with varying sensory experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observation of cortical activity also revealed a potential functional role of reciprocal feedback connections in object recognition, where the flow of information from higher cortical areas to these lower ones contributes to their dynamic capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We discovered that these so-called ‘top-down’ feedback connections convey information from areas of the visual cortex that represent previously stored information about the nature and identity of objects, which is acquired through experience and behavioral context,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a sense, the higher-order cortical areas send an instruction to the lower areas to perform a particular calculation, and the return signal—the feedforward signal—is the result of that calculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These interactions are likely to be operating continually as we recognize an object and, more broadly speaking, make visual sense of our surroundings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autism research applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are part of an increasing recognition of the importance and prevalence of feedback information flow in the visual cortex—and perhaps far beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would argue that top-down interactions are central to all brain functions, including other senses, motor control, and higher order cognitive functions, so understanding the cellular and circuit basis for these interactions could expand our understanding of the mechanisms underlying brain disorders,” Gilbert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, his lab is beginning to investigate animal models of autism both at the behavioral and the imaging level. Will Snyder, a research specialist in Gilbert’s lab, will study perceptual differences between autism-model mice and their wild-type littermates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conjunction, the lab will observe large neuronal populations in the animals’ brains as they engage in natural behaviors using the highly advanced neuroimaging technologies in the Elizabeth R. Miller Brain Observatory, an interdisciplinary research center located on Rockefeller’s campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to see if we can identify any perceptual differences between these two groups and the operation of cortical circuits that may underly these differences,” Gilbert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4a212c2f24300a382529212f2c2f26262f38642f2e3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Katherine Fenz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://rockefeller.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rockefeller University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Katherine Fenz – Rockefeller University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2406684122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Expectation-dependent stimulus selectivity in the ventral visual cortical pathway&lt;/a&gt;” by Charles D.

She also dedicates her writing to spreading awareness about living with &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-is-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting Parkinson’s is not an enjoyable experience for anyone, particularly when you’re young. It’s not something that’s predictable, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; began appearing in late 2021, when I was in my early 50s. That’s supposed to be an age when we’re still active and can take care of our families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the onset of my Parkinson’s, I’d recently recovered from COVID-19 and thought the slight hand tremors I was having were a symptom of long COVID-19. I believed they’d eventually go away. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen, and instead, they worsened, resulting in my terrible &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-tests-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; in June 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of a &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/services/spect-brain-datscan"&gt;Spect Brain DaTscan&lt;/a&gt;, a nuclear imaging test that allows doctors to look at brain function, were merciless: I had Parkinson’s disease at age 52.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been an energetic and lively woman, adept at multitasking and balancing home and work duties. However, with the arrival of Parkinson’s, that abundance of energy abruptly ended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most traumatic part about this condition is the total transformation of my daily routine, especially when it comes to taking care of my family, and my 80-year-old mother in particular. She is a widow and has relied on my help since we lost my beloved father to cancer over 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As she aged, her care needs became more evident. She doesn’t drive, so before Parkinson’s appeared in my life, I was happy to take her to the local market or the cemetery to visit my dad’s grave. My car has always been a symbol of independence for me and a way to take care of my mom. But Parkinson’s deprived me of that important part of my independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my diagnosis, I haven’t been able to drive. My mom doesn’t get out of the house often, and sometimes she’ll still ask me if I feel good enough to drive, which breaks my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I’m trying to encourage her by having a positive attitude about my health condition, even when my symptoms are obvious and they upset me. She’ll see me leaning on a wall and ask why I’m doing that. I’ll reply that I’m just exercising to strengthen my back. The truth is that I’m experiencing dizziness, vertigo, and leg weakness, but I don’t want her to know how severe my symptoms are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that can’t always be avoided. One time, my shoulder froze up and I couldn’t get out of bed or go to the bathroom. While my husband was at work, my mother helped care for me, which exhausted her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get tired very quickly, so my husband helps out when he’s not working. Parkinson’s has turned our family’s relationship into a triangle of mutual support. I help my mom when she needs me, and my husband helps me when I need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s has changed my life forever. Every new symptom is a challenge. But I’ve learned that while Parkinson’s can change the way you move, it can’t change the way you love.&lt;/p&gt;

Neither did medications for withdrawal from xylazine, the animal tranquilizer added in recent years to illicit opioids sold in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;At Penn Presbyterian Medical Center’s ER, physician Jeanmarie Perrone wasn’t sure what she was seeing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;There were concerning reports from the streets, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Paramedics were treating opioid overdose victims who began breathing again with the overdose-reversing drug naloxone but would not wake up, suggesting that the opioids they were using had been laced with another powerful sedative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Emergency physicians across the city began meeting regularly with the city health department to figure out what was causing the overdoses and the withdrawal symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;They went through a list of substances being added to illicit drugs and detected through the city’s drug-checking program everything from local anesthetics to an industrial chemical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“We knew what was in the drug supply, and we knew there was an abnormal syndrome in people, but it was hard to tie those together,” Perrone said. “Ultimately, it was a process of elimination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;By January, they zeroed in on another veterinary tranquilizer that was quickly replacing xylazine in the city’s drug supply, called medetomidine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Medetomidine includes the drug dexmedetomidine, typically used in intensive care settings. In approved medical applications, it is generally regarded as a safer sedative option for some patients, because it does not cause slow or labored breathing, Perrone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;But it also can cause severe withdrawal symptoms, similar to what Perrone and her colleagues were seeing in their ERs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=" relative w-fit mt-6 mb-0 font-inquirer-headline text-primary"&gt;&lt;h3 class="block font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-5 leading-5 sm:text-8 sm:leading-8 lg:text-9 lg:leading-9"&gt;The rapid rise of medetomidine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;At three Philadelphia-area health systems, Perrone and other emergency room doctors collected data on patients who had experienced severe withdrawal symptoms that did not respond to standard treatment options for opioid and xylazine withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Their findings were featured in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7415a1.htm?s_cid=mm7415a1_w" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7415a1.htm?s_cid=mm7415a1_w"&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, along with reports on the drug from Chicago and Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;In Philadelphia, the study authors noted, 72% of illicit opioids tested contained medetomidine by the last four months of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The rise was stunningly rapid: Last May, Philadelphia health officials issued an alert about medetomidine based on the first &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://www.inquirer.com/health/medetomidine-nitazenes-philadelphia-drug-overdoses-20240518.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.inquirer.com/health/medetomidine-nitazenes-philadelphia-drug-overdoses-20240518.html"&gt;two positive tests of drug samples&lt;/a&gt; collected in the city. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Medetomidine’s spread follows efforts to crack down on xylazine, which just last year was found in 98% of fentanyl sold on the street. By the time of the study, it was detected in 31% of illicit opioids tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Perrone and her colleagues drew on data from 165 patients who visited Penn Medicine, &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://www.inquirer.com/topic/jefferson-health"&gt;Jefferson Health&lt;/a&gt;, and Temple Health between September 2024 and January 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;In that time period, 91% of those patients required treatment in intensive care units because of their withdrawal symptoms, and 24% needed to be intubated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;That was in part because the doctors found they could treat the severe withdrawal symptoms with a combination of drugs, including dexmedetomidine, that is permitted to be dispensed only in an ICU, Perrone said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Over the course of the study, 137 patients were treated with dexmedetomidine, and all saw their withdrawal symptoms decrease. But the need for ICU treatment presents an additional challenge for treating patients in medetomidine withdrawal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“We don’t have a lot of capacity in the ICU,” Perrone said. “Usually, you don’t need to be in the ICU for opioid withdrawal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;At one health system where Perrone and her colleagues gathered data, patients were tested for medetomidine and its byproducts as it exits the body. All patients with abnormal withdrawal symptoms treated there tested positive for the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Better drug testing at more hospitals could help doctors more quickly identify patients who need treatment for medetomidine withdrawal, Perrone said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The CDC’s report presented Philadelphia’s experience alongside evidence from other big cities about the threat of medetomidine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;In Chicago, researchers outlined an overdose spike from medetomidine mixed with opioids, suspected to have sickened 178 people in a single week in May 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;In Pittsburgh, researchers looked at 23 cases of suspected medetomidine withdrawal at two hospitals between October 2024 and March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Inquirer.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 17:01:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxQWmdtN3EySWl2SG9ycGp4TlVpMk9RLTZwYjJjNlBNRW9DY1NaYTdUbHFVdGp1VkwwLWprRzdhYWFiMVRtNGYtbVg1MFBCT0pLNE03T3RKMUxoR3oxUGFtZ2pwQS1BWlBmREJaS1dUcGdRR2tzY2FtaGhhMG5GcHRZRGNiVkVLRlJjb21Qd21GYjRoUUdwVDgtOUk4X2xYZlJKRURrLW9oRWZqVnBnOGRieQ</guid></item><item><title>基因编辑疗法显示对抗晚期胃肠道癌的早期成功- Medical Xpress | Gene-editing therapy shows early success in fighting advanced gastrointestinal cancers - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxPQ0pmcV8wLTdoTHNyUHJpSGxteGk3MlRGUF9KQW8wZ2R5eHJDbHZ4dWJwSkl5QkZKOVkyV250U3k3OVVVOTBEcFZCUER0UXc0NmFGaTNmSHk2WnBvVEJQN1k0cEJWRDBmT3prOXdVX0gxWFpaOE1MYnZSbnhqZTN1ZkVXa3BIdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Minnesota have completed a first-in-human clinical trial testing a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technique to help the immune system fight advanced gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. The results, recently &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S147020452500083X" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet Oncology&lt;/i&gt;, show encouraging signs of the safety and potential effectiveness of the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"Despite many advances in understanding the genomic drivers and other factors causing cancer, with few exceptions, stage IV &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/colorectal+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; remains a largely incurable disease," said Emil Lou, MD, Ph.D., a gastrointestinal oncologist with the University of Minnesota Medical School, Masonic Cancer Center and M Health Fairview, and clinical principal investigator for the trial. "This trial brings a new approach from our research labs into the clinic and shows potential for improving outcomes in patients with late-stage disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers used CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing to modify a type of immune cell called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). By deactivating a gene called CISH, the researchers found that modified TILs were better able to recognize and attack &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment was tested in 12 highly metastatic, end-stage patients and found to be generally safe, with no &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/serious+side+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;serious side effects&lt;/a&gt; from the gene editing. Several patients in the trial saw the growth of their cancer halt, and one patient had a complete response, meaning that in this patient, the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metastatic+tumors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;metastatic tumors&lt;/a&gt; disappeared over the course of several months and have not returned in over two years.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"We believe that CISH is a key factor preventing T cells from recognizing and eliminating tumors," said Branden Moriarity, Ph.D., associate professor at the University of Minnesota Medical School, Masonic Cancer Center researcher and co-director of the Center for Genome Engineering. "Because it acts inside the cell, it couldn't be blocked using traditional methods, so we turned to CRISPR-based genetic engineering."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other cancer therapies that require ongoing doses, this gene edit is permanent and built into the T cells from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With our gene-editing approach, the checkpoint inhibition is accomplished in one step and is permanently hardwired into the T cells," said Beau Webber, Ph.D., associate professor at the University of Minnesota Medical School and Masonic Cancer Center researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team delivered more than 10 billion engineered TIL without &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adverse+side+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;adverse side effects&lt;/a&gt;, demonstrating the feasibility of genetically engineering TIL without sacrificing the ability to grow them to large numbers in the lab in a clinically compliant environment, which has never been done before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the results are promising, the process remains costly and complex. Efforts are underway to streamline production and better understand why the therapy worked so effectively in the patient with a complete response in order to improve the approach in future trials.&lt;/p&gt;

"Concurrently, the virus continues to circulate in wild birds, backyard flocks, and hunted migratory species, further amplifying the risk to humans and domestic animals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization (WHO), H5N1 is one of several influenza viruses that causes a highly infectious respiratory disease in birds called avian influenza (or "bird flu").

Even though H5N1 is not easily transmitted between humans, its high mortality rate in human beings makes it a serious public health concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H5N1 is a subtype of the Influenza A virus, named after two surface proteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). While there are several subtypes (such as H1N1 or H3N2), H5N1 is particularly dangerous due to its potential to cause severe illness in both birds and humans. Classified as a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, it spreads rapidly and can be lethal to birds, leading to major economic losses in the poultry industry and posing risks to food security in affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mode of transmission of H5N1 virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The H5N1 virus remains as an animal virus that primarily infects animals, according to WHO. The H5N1 virus is constantly evolving and could potentially become easily transmissible from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;a data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#News#href" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/kanye-west-reunites-with-wife-bianca-to-sue-dentist-for-making-him-addicted-to-nitrous-oxide/articleshow/120827689.cms" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank"&gt;Kanye West reunites with wife Bianca to sue dentist for making him addicted to nitrous oxide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Almost all cases of H5N1 virus infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments, for example live bird markets. There have been some instances of spread from infected mammals to humans as well. While there may have been some cases that were not detected, the virus does not seem to easily infect humans or spread from person to person, based on the current knowledge and understanding," according to WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms of H5N1 virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms in humans range from typical flu-like signs (fever, cough, sore throat) to severe respiratory illnesses like pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Some patients have also experienced diarrhea, encephalitis, and multi-organ failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Co-circulation of H5N1 viruses with swine or human seasonal influenza viruses, especially during the Northern hemisphere winter season, could lead to reassortant viruses that can efficiently spread in humans," the LANCET report warns. The CDC currently considers the virus to have a moderate future pandemic risk when compared to other Influenza A viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The symptoms of H5N1 infection may include fever (often high fever, &amp;gt; 38°C) and malaise, cough, sore throat and muscle aches. Other early symptoms may include conjunctivitis and other non-respiratory symptoms. The infection may progress quickly to severe respiratory illness and neurologic changes (altered mental status or seizures).H5N1 virus has also been detected in samples collected from people without symptoms who had exposure to infected animals or their environments," says WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-ga-onclick="Inarticle articleshow link click#News#href" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/shein-ford-procter-gamble-and-more-full-list-of-american-companies-raising-prices-due-to-trumps-tariffs/articleshow/120824366.cms" data-type="tilCustomLink" target="_blank"&gt;Shein, Ford, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble and more: Full list of American companies raising prices due to Trump's tariffs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is H5N1 virus in humans treated?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Influenza patients should be managed properly to prevent severe illness and death. Patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection with progressive, complicated or severe illness – or those with asymptomatic or mild disease but who are at increased risk of severe disease – should be treated with antiviral medicines, for example oseltamivir, as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per WHO, as part of agency's influenza pandemic preparedness work, some countries have developed and licensed vaccines that could be used for avian influenza viruses, including H5N1. Currently, human infections of H5N1 are limited and vaccines are not recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is it safe to eat eggs, chicken and milk from areas with H5N1 outbreaks in animals?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meat products and eggs can be safely consumed, provided they are properly prepared. Please see the question "How can meat and eggs be safely prepared?” for detailed information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming raw or incompletely cooked meat and eggs from areas experiencing outbreaks of avian influenza is high-risk and should be avoided. Likewise, animals that are sick or have died unexpectedly should not be eaten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the potential health risks to consumers, raw milk should be avoided. WHO advises consuming pasteurized milk. If pasteurized milk isn’t available, heating raw milk until it boils can also make it safer for consumption. Some of the guidelines issued by WHO are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;keep clean&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;separate raw and cooked foods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;cook thoroughly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;keep food at safe temperatures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;use safe water and raw materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GVN scientists were quoted as saying in the report, "In the US, sporadic human infections with no known contact with infected animals highlight the possibility of viral adaptation for efficient human-to-human transmission."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Concurrently, the virus continues to circulate in wild birds, backyard flocks, and hunted migratory species, further amplifying the risk to humans and domestic animals,” they continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Economic Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:33:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>我的婚姻和性生活被数百万人服用的常见药物毁了...请留意我的警告-每日邮报 | My marriage and sex life was ruined by common drug taken by millions... please heed my warning - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxQVF9MeTlMT05tUkdZZzJHWWNYZnF5dlJTeWZsbERETl9WaTVKUUtmTDZFNFE1MjRjWlpMWEU2SnFKOG9xS2p0eUpaOE5CWlNzQjJ0VDRVN0pYWlVmRHI1bjlxNGthbnpndmlGNzVjRHFGclRYbjlMakVSNGk4UDhBUlB2LU1acGdqSURCSDNhUVVEUdIBlwFBVV95cUxPZndNSzhLSlI4Z2tFMlJyMEJsUUJ3dVF6QnZOMnZZeTdBb0IyV2dfZXV3cEVmQmoxQ09XNV9jUzF0MUh6TldRMHNxRmNSdDRFSFBjdHJzLTNNLUNTNWotcHVVYzk0ZGpiRW9hcW9yd0JkUHA3ZE1jOWFjcGpfVFpmQ2tPTlZtYXdubXh1OXFQUnVJYUVRR2pF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thammika Songkaeo knew instantly her husband was the one when they met in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pair connected almost immediately and married two years later, welcoming a daughter into the world together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But despite how deep their emotional connection was, there was always one thought nagging away at Songkaeo: her husband was not that interested in sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When they first met, her now ex-husband told Songkaeo how he had low libido and erectile dysfunction which he said started after taking&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14644175/genitals-mutilated-common-drug-warning-others.html"&gt; finasteride, a drug used by millions&lt;/a&gt; of men to prevent hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she dismissed his problems as 'something temporary'. When he struggled to perform in the bedroom, she got him to take Viagra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fearing being labeled a 'sex addict', she avoided discussing it with friends — but quickly started to feel isolated, and became depressed, and then suicidal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After seven years, she ended the relationship and filed for divorce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finasteride is&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14640391/FDA-effects-hair-loss-drug.html"&gt; sold by telehealth companies &lt;/a&gt;for as little as $30 for a month's supply, with doctors saying it can prevent hair loss with little more than a pill a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Thammika Songkaeo has revealed how finasteride destroyed her marriage, saying it left her ex-husband with low libido and erectile dysfunction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug was originally developed for men with an enlarged prostate, but it has since become a popular hair loss treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 2.6million men in the US take the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It works by blocking the conversion of the male hormone testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a compound thought to cause hair loss by shrinking hair follicles on the scalp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But DHT is also crucial for sexual arousal, erectile function, and genital tissue health, and its reduction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the drug shows a remarkable ability to promote hair growth, some men pay a steep price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some say the drug ruined their sex life, genitals and relationships — even long after they stopped taking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Songkaeo's husband was prescribed the drug by an unnamed health clinic and took it before they met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors believe he was suffering from post-finasteride syndrome,&lt;span&gt; a condition of persistent sexual, neurological, physical and mental adverse reactions in patients after they take finasteride to treat hair loss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Her experience inspired her to write a book about a woman stuck in a marriage with an asexual husband in Singapore, titled: &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.penguin.sg/book/stamford-hospital/"&gt;Stamford Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. It was launched in the US on April 15 this year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking to DailyMail.com, Songkaeo said her husband told her he was suffering from side effects of the drug after they became a couple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We noticed... that there was something off about the physical intimacy,' she said. 'There just wasn't the amount or intensity that there would be in my experience of a relationship.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She revealed the damage it had caused on the YouTube channel Moral Medicine, where patients who say they were harmed by finasteride publish their stories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'I thought it was something that could be overcome, as in I did not think it would be a lifelong thing — and from what I understood from my ex-partner there was no way for him to know if it would be a lifelong thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I thought, "maybe it will be ok.

It turns out, it was not ok.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The couple met on the East Coast, and initially dated there before moving to Singapore together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Songkaeo said in an&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXnH0qZ30Y0&amp;amp;t=359s"&gt; interview with Moral Medicine &lt;/a&gt;— which raises awareness over harms caused by finasteride — that the couple tried Viagra to help with intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after the birth of their daughter, she felt that what physical intimacy there was had now almost gone — and that there was just too little in the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt extremely lonely at that point,' she told this website, 'I've never felt that kind of loneliness in my life and never knew loneliness like that could be possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It felt like a loneliness that had no place on this Earth. It was very intense and harrowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And became like something that I could not live with, because it became very intense and harrowing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mark Millich said that after taking finasteride his genitals shrunk, and he also suffered from serious mental health problems &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After speaking to her husband about their differences, the pair decided to amicably end the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Songkaeo said she experienced opposition from her family, who are from Thailand, when she revealed she was ending her marriage over intimacy problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But since the relationship was resolved, she and her husband have remained best friends — and now happily co-parent their daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She would never, however, re-enter the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finasteride works by blocking the enzyme that converts testosterone into DHT, which — according to the Cleveland Clinic — is typically found in the genitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About two to three percent of finasteride patients experience side effects, doctors say — with the most common being problems getting an erection, less interest in sex and problems with ejaculation, such as little or no semen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors tend to tell patients that these will subside after they stop taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Giving other women advice on how to handle the issue, she said: 'Letting compassion for both people guide the conversation leads to the best results. A conversation that is led by love and understanding for both people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I really don't think that people who suffer from post finasteride syndrome should be treated as anything other than victims of a very dangerous drug in terms of the side effects it can give.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At the same time, I don't think that any partner needs to endure the effects as if they were inconsequential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'I think that if both parties arrive at the conversation and carry the conversation with love, care, respect and empathy... even the way the relationship dissolves can become a beautiful part of a couple or ex-couple relationship.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:09:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQVF9MeTlMT05tUkdZZzJHWWNYZnF5dlJTeWZsbERETl9WaTVKUUtmTDZFNFE1MjRjWlpMWEU2SnFKOG9xS2p0eUpaOE5CWlNzQjJ0VDRVN0pYWlVmRHI1bjlxNGthbnpndmlGNzVjRHFGclRYbjlMakVSNGk4UDhBUlB2LU1acGdqSURCSDNhUVVEUdIBlwFBVV95cUxPZndNSzhLSlI4Z2tFMlJyMEJsUUJ3dVF6QnZOMnZZeTdBb0IyV2dfZXV3cEVmQmoxQ09XNV9jUzF0MUh6TldRMHNxRmNSdDRFSFBjdHJzLTNNLUNTNWotcHVVYzk0ZGpiRW9hcW9yd0JkUHA3ZE1jOWFjcGpfVFpmQ2tPTlZtYXdubXh1OXFQUnVJYUVRR2pF</guid></item><item><title>“我甚至不敢吃冰箱里的蔬菜” ：关注食品纯度的饮食失调--《卫报》 | ‘I was scared to even eat the vegetables in my fridge’: the eating disorder that focuses on food purity - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNOXU5dFFkNUVDdXg4UklPenkwNjg4a1hfZmZ5ZW42QVpKcU5zajU2QWNJUmh3U0VoUmNxT1U1TmJ5TnAyZG9FWnZwSDNDNUVZYnhOTVpEemRfamdTVDh1ZXhPeTZxM21Oc0ZOb3NwZFJkYnk0NzhOWl9IUFJRNjg0NEkySWZZTDgz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Katie Lundgreen Urness’s struggles with disordered eating began when she was just 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A gymnast, she put a lot of value in being petite.

Urness’s hard-won recovery was driven by her dream of motherhood – she knew she wanted a baby and worried it “would suffer and not develop right because I was restricting food”, she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When Urness became pregnant at 25, her relationship with food was the healthiest it had ever been. Soon, TikTok and Instagram began serving her motherhood wellness content, even though she hadn’t searched for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One common theme was food purity. Posts warned against the “dangers” of common grocery items – that there was high-fructose corn syrup in most baby formula and harmful levels of pesticides in a box of cereal (&lt;a href="https://www.scarymommy.com/parenting/high-fructose-corn-syrup-in-formula?utm_campaign=scarymommy&amp;amp;utm_content=TIMESTAMP_EPOCH&amp;amp;utm_medium=owned&amp;amp;utm_source=SOCIAL_NETWORK" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;both claims&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://news.immunologic.org/p/no-your-cheerios-arent-filled-with" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;have been debunked&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another theme: the corrupt medical system. “The content is telling you not to trust your doctor, saying the system is outdated and vicious, misogynistic,” says Urness. She recalls creators claiming the &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/tests/glucose-screening-tests-during-pregnancy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;glucose drink&lt;/a&gt; doctors administer as part of a test for gestational diabetes was “poison”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Urness watched influencers who have been &lt;a href="https://news.immunologic.org/p/the-congressional-american-health" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;critiqued by experts&lt;/a&gt; for exaggerating and misrepresenting health risks, including Courtney Swan, who has &lt;a href="https://x.com/realfoodology/status/1874882388674973942" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommended a supplement&lt;/a&gt; to “detox the spike proteins” of the Covid vaccine; self-styled food-safety investigator Vani Hari, whom Vox called a “&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/4/13/8385295/science-reporting-ethics" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;peddler of pseudoscience&lt;/a&gt;”; and siblings Casey and Calley Means, a physician and entrepreneur, the latter of whom &lt;a href="https://x.com/beardedhoosier_/status/1870992751841452350" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; “kids should be drinking more &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/nov/26/what-is-unpasteurized-raw-milk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;raw milk&lt;/a&gt;” despite medical &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/29171/Raw-milk-products-can-cause-serious-illness-in?autologincheck=redirected" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;consensus&lt;/a&gt; that it can contain pathogens linked to life-threatening illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These creators have much in common: all encourage hypervigilance about supposed dietary threats, have publicly supported health secretary &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;, and profit from the ideas they spread. Many food-purity creators benefit from ad revenue driven by their attention-grabbing claims or sales of products like supplements, diet books, colon cleanses or online courses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There is a small grain of truth in some alarmist food content”, which helps it appeal to people’s sense of skepticism and caution, says Christy Harrison, a registered dietitian, author and host of the Rethinking Wellness podcast. “But it often gets blown up beyond all proportion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For instance, the American food industry engages in problematic practices, such as confined animal feeding operations and industry lobbying against regulations. “But in my many years of reading nutrition research, I’ve found that the rhetoric connecting food-industry practices to weight and human health is often overblown and not backed by sound science,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f9f25e7b-4711-4bb8-a6e8-4eeeba2e13ec" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":10,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"What do we mean when we say women can be ‘too muscular’?

By the time she delivered her son in 2023, she was obsessively fixated on the healthfulness, safety and purity of food. “I was scared to even eat the vegetables in my fridge” because of pesticides, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I thought it would be safer for me to risk going back to restrictive food patterns to protect myself and my breastfed baby from all these bad things,” says Urness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to experts, anxious preoccupation with the safety and purity of food is a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36436144/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;form of disordered eating&lt;/a&gt; called orthorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Orthorexia nervosa was coined in 1997 by an integrative physician named Steven Bratman,” says Harrison, the dietitian. “He was seeing a lot of obsessive thinking about food and nutrition in his patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Being mindful about food isn’t inherently disordered – many people want to eat healthily. By contrast, “orthorexia can be defined as an obsessive and extreme fixation on food, like purity of food, healthfulness of food, cleanliness,” Harrison says. “It’s a very common way people can be disordered about eating,” she says. Chemophobia, an irrational, broad distrust of chemicals based in misinformation, is another common symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Nonetheless, orthorexia remains under the radar. It is not yet listed in psychiatric classification systems such as the DSM-5, and can be difficult for doctors to distinguish from basic health-consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Orthorexia can present on a spectrum and be harmful regardless of severity, explains Harrison. Severe orthorexia presents as a level of obsessiveness that can “interfere with people’s lives”, disrupting major factors such as social relationships and work, she says. It can lead to nutritional deficiencies, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34921564/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;co-occur&lt;/a&gt; with body dysmorphia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and anorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s not just healthy eating. It takes over your entire brain,” says Urness, who still considers herself orthorexic, but is working on recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A 2023 &lt;a href="https://jogh.org/2023/jogh-13-04087" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that orthorexia is prevalent across genders, and that “the proportion of orthorexia nervosa symptoms seems to be increasing”. Men are more likely to frame restrictive eating around performance and fitness (think raw-meat diets and biohacking) and women around food-purity concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8a1d8d4c-1574-4dd0-b8b1-0c0f47cc684e" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘Orthorexia is politically useful to keep people anxious about what’s safe, what’s true and who can be trusted.’&lt;/span&gt; Composite: Guardian/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Clinically significant orthorexia – cases where obsessive “healthy” eating causes impairment in daily life – is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26902744/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; in research studies. But the current literature does not capture what’s happening right now, says Danielle Shine, an Australian registered dietitian and PhD candidate researching nutrition misinformation in social media, who is working with several clients in recovery from orthorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Social media is causing more and more people to develop disordered beliefs and behaviors” around food, says Shine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One 2017 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28251592/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that 49% of Instagram users who followed health food-oriented accounts displayed orthorexia symptoms. Since then, short-form video platforms including TikTok have risen in popularity, supercharging the reach of alarmist food-purity content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;llison Hume, 40, an elementary school teacher and mother of two in Ontario, found herself acutely anxious about her and her family’s health and safety after a difficult second birth during the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“While rocking my new baby, I spent hours on social media,” she said. In particular, she consumed information from Hari and Bobby Parrish. Parrish, a creator without formal nutritional qualifications, has been criticized by &lt;a href="https://labmuffin.com/parabens-fragrance-colorants-talc-debunking-bobby-parrishs-tiktok-misinformation/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;chemists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5E8ileCrLlY&amp;amp;t=20s&amp;amp;ab_channel=AndresAyesta" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;dietitians&lt;/a&gt; for spreading alarmist misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These creators “made me feel safe at the time, because their information was so black-and-white”, says Hume. “They would say: ‘Stop eating x, y and z and you won’t get cancer.’ It felt comforting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hari has a “&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/thefoodbabe/p/CGa3UTtFoC5/?hl=en" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;no-no list&lt;/a&gt;” that includes many common ingredients generally recognized as safe when consumed in typical amounts, including natural flavors, emulsifiers and MSG. Many of these additives are found in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ultra-processed-foods" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, which the National Institutes of Health generally &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8217149/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;advises&lt;/a&gt; everyone to eat less of due to their frequently high fat, salt and sugar content. But seeing these additives framed as outright threats, Hume began to fear them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She tossed all foods containing these “no-no” ingredients, and shopped exclusively at high-end natural food markets. This doubled her grocery spending, “which was a big financial strain”, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f3d20915-4c22-4833-ba0a-e7b6ce66c0e0" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":31,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"My secret life as a model: ‘High fashion loved me most when I was visibly bony’","elementId":"f3d20915-4c22-4833-ba0a-e7b6ce66c0e0","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/mar/20/my-secret-life-as-a-model-high-fashion-loved-me-most-when-i-was-visibly-bony"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To check whether products contained forbidden additives, Hume used ingredient-scanning apps. If she had to purchase something “bad” because an approved item was unavailable, “it would be hard to sleep at night”, she says. “I really did think that our health was at stake if I didn’t follow these rules. The idea was that if we did get sick, it would be my fault and mine alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At the time, she didn’t know there was a name for the obsessive, disordered thinking she was experiencing. “I was in denial that anything was wrong with me,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But her family noticed huge mood changes. Hume became irritable and controlling. “I remember asking myself why everything was so hard,” she says. “Why aren’t other people following the same food rules? Why don’t they care about their health as much as I do?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When she reflects on these habits now, Hume feels guilty. “It did end up affecting others around me as well, in particular my mom,” she says. “She also has a lot of health anxiety and it increased due to my influence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now, Hume is working with professionals to overcome orthorexia, and believes that content creators intentionally manipulate people like her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“They are very aware of what they are doing. They are making a lot of money off vulnerable people like me … people like parents, the elderly and the chronically sick, and I really don’t think they care,” says Hume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since the Covid-19 pandemic, trust in American health institutions has &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-january-2025/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;declined&lt;/a&gt;, creating fertile ground for wellness misinformation. In its place has risen a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/5g-coronavirus-and-contagious-superstition" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;conspiratorial digital ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/feb/27/how-anti-vax-parents-changed-their-minds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;anti-science&lt;/a&gt; rhetoric promoted by figures such as RFK Jr – whose &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/13/rfk-jr-moms-health-trump" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“Make America healthy again” (Maha) slogan&lt;/a&gt; has been adopted by his supporters, including a subset of self-described “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/16/her-voice-movement-jenny-donnelly-ziklag-trump" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;mama bears&lt;/a&gt;” who see themselves as family protectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“If I’m nursing a baby and my brain is tired, it’s really easy to fall for these emotionally charged videos that are designed to target the ‘mama bear’ within me,” says Urness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Alarmist Maha posts can trigger or perpetuate orthorexic behaviors in viewers, even if that is not the creators’ intention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In food-purity culture, personal vigilance is the only safeguard against threats to health; sickness is caused by being lazy, ignorant and poisoning yourself.

But Maha mom creators also spread misinformation; in one viral post, a creator falsely claimed that propylene glycol – used as a food additive in salad dressing – was the same as &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DEnZgFnvIR2/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;antifreeze&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The underlying message of much Maha food content is that mothers must try to cook from scratch as much as possible, not just because it’s tasty or pleasant to do so, but because food in the US is inherently “dangerous”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet according to the 2022 &lt;a href="https://impact.economist.com/sustainability/project/food-security-index/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Global Food Security Index&lt;/a&gt;, the US ranks third in global food-safety standards, behind Canada and Denmark. “We have an incredibly safe food supply in the US in general. Historically, the FDA has done a pretty good job of keeping us safe,” says Harrison. “And I’m no apologist for the food industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“My issue with it is that they’re using food as a way to try to entrap women and give up certain types of political and economical power,” Dr Alex Ketchum, a professor at McGill University’s Institute for Gender, Sexuality and Feminist Studies, whose work explores food and culture, says of Maha ideology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More domestic work means less time for community engagement, activism and ambitions. In her 1995 work Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body, philosopher Susan Bordo describes dieting as a form of self-deprivation that aligns with broader cultural narratives requiring women to limit their presence in the public sphere, both physically, by being smaller, and socially, by conforming to restrictive ideals. For Bordo, this shrinking is less about weight than about diminishing women’s agency and visibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c645cebf-4655-4c0d-9d49-f1f40098f932" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":49,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Ozempic is hailed as a miracle drug.

It is also politically useful to keep people anxious about what’s safe, what’s true and who can be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Holding citizenry in fear and making them anxious around food in particular is one of the ways authoritarian or totalitarian leaders exert their power,” observes Dr Emily Contois, an associate professor of media studies at the University of Tulsa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In Benito Mussolini’s fascist Italy of the 1920s-40s, says Contois, food became a political tool used to reinforce women’s roles in the home. The regime relied on women as domestic caretakers – what Contois calls “home-front civic engineers”. Mothers were expected to make do with food shortages, masking policy failures with their sheer force of labor as the government failed to provide basic care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;avigating the medical system can be frustrating for people with chronic illnesses who don’t feel like they’re getting satisfying answers from their doctors. The idea of experimenting with alternative paths to relief, like “cleaning up” one’s diet, can feel like a matter of survival. But attempts to get better can spiral into a harmful place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Anna Zambreny, 29, a Maryland-based healthcare recruiter, says she has spent at least six years with orthorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Zambreny cut out foods including gluten, dairy, eggs and meat while trying to heal various ailments, including eczema, Lyme disease and fatigue. The safest way to try eliminating food groups is with the help of a registered dietitian who can ensure adequate nutrition; Zambreny took advice from social media food-purity influencers and an allergist who recommended &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/wheat-belly-arguments-are-based-on-shaky-science-critics-say-1.2974214" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;scientifically uncredible&lt;/a&gt; books like Dr William Davis’s Wheat Belly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The idea that we weren’t being told the truth about food and that it was poisoning us started to affect my relationships. I didn’t really want to eat out … I didn’t really enjoy anything,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Zambreny’s health symptoms progressed despite her efforts; now she reflects that many of them were likely rooted in self-inflicted malnourishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I felt like everything I was eating could make or break my health,” she says. “I don’t think I was getting enough variety of food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Today, Zambreny feels angry and frustrated with the influencers she once trusted, some of whom she’s seen flip-flop on their messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“They were vegan and then they’ve gone completely carnivore, or they were anti-medication and now they say getting on anxiety medication is the best thing that ever happened to them. And that feels very harmful to me because depending on when you tune into what they are talking about, it can really sway what you’re doing,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It makes me mad,” says Zambreny. “It feels like they don’t actually care about changing health policy. It’s more like status they’re looking for … They’re so out of touch with the health advice most people need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Zambreny’s frustration may resonate at a moment when basic nutritional support is eroding, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-food-banks-warn-strain-republicans-seek-food-aid-cuts-2023-04-21/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;hunger rates are climbing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/chart-detail?chartId=58350#:~:text=From%202020%20to%202024%2C%20the,percent%20over%20the%20same%20period." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;food prices are surging&lt;/a&gt;. This year, Trump has cut &lt;a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/trump-admin-cuts-program-that-brought-local-food-to-school-cafeterias/2025/03" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$660m of funding&lt;/a&gt; for local produce in schools and childcare centres, and canceled another &lt;a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/news/2025/04/02/food-banks--sudden-federal-cuts-threaten-our-ability-to-assist-new-yorkers" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$500m&lt;/a&gt; in funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which helps food banks. He has also proposed reductions to the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), threatening universal free meal programs for children and the &lt;a href="https://www.urban.org/data-tools/snap-cuts-state-county-gaps" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap)&lt;/a&gt;, which approximately 42 million people rely on for food essentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There’s this expectation that you are personally responsible for your own health,” says Contois – despite social determinants of health, such as physical environment, education access and economic status, being largely beyond individual control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Fear-mongering around less urgent issues can distract people from more pressing health risks. “If you can make people afraid, you open the door for all sorts of policies to be possible,” says Contois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For instance, West Virginia recently banned &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/30/west-virginia-food-dye-ban" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;several food dyes&lt;/a&gt;.

Experts &lt;a href="https://drjessicaknurick.substack.com/p/the-green-juice-effect-why-west-virginias" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; the ban is performative, and will not meaningfully improve West Virginians’ health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s gamifying government and science and regulation instead of actually creating processes that ensure a safe, fair and transparent food system for all,” says Contois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Social media food-purity culture does not tend to focus on systemic problems such as the climate crisis &lt;a href="https://www.bnovate.com/post/water-quality-in-food-safety" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;degrading water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/02/soil-degradation-biodiversity-planet/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;soil quality&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-launches-biggest-deregulatory-action-us-history" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reduced&lt;/a&gt; oil-and-gas industry regulations that could lead to more heavy-metal pollution in the environment and foodways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Telling people their biggest problem is junk-food additives or pasteurized milk is a “distraction from the collective challenges of the US food system”, says Ketchum.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Orthorexia shows us what can happen when confusing, alarmist voices fill the silence left by collapsing health and environmental institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;“S&lt;/span&gt;cience-minded professionals saved me in the end,” says Hume, who now follows several evidence-based health and nutrition professionals on social media, including dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/andydoeshealthy/?hl=en" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Andy Miller&lt;/a&gt; and health communicator &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/dr.andrealove/?hl=en" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Dr Andrea Love&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4df062e0-c53b-4332-84dc-4f4da0360a30" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":72,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Now comes the ‘womanosphere’: the anti-feminist media telling women to be thin, fertile and Republican","elementId":"4df062e0-c53b-4332-84dc-4f4da0360a30","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/24/womanosphere-conservative-women"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For people struggling with orthorexia, Harrison recommends working with a registered dietitian and a therapist. Treatments for orthorexia include “challenging disordered beliefs about food, [dietitians] offering ‘meal support’ to help clients get through anxiety-producing meals and referring to a higher level of care if needed”, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It has taken consistent hard work and patience, but Hume has “very few food fears” now. “I remember telling my psychotherapist that I ate a hot dog for the first time in three years,” she said. “I was very nervous about it, but boy, was it good!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But Hume has already lost a lot to her food-purity obsession. “I always get teary-eyed when I think back to missing all the special memories I could have made with my newborn and my three-year-old,” she says. “I was so preoccupied with what I thought was keeping them ‘safe’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Recovery from orthorexia isn’t only about personal healing. It also requires a cultural shift: access to safe, science-backed nutrition for all; investment in public health infrastructure; and a renewed commitment to care, trust and collective responsibility for our shared wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This isn’t a time to put up a fence and build a moat,” says Contois. “This is the time to build a longer table and invite other people into it.

Although mood improves post-recovery, hidden deficits in reward processing and decision-making linger, potentially contributing to relapse vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using computational models, researchers found that these individuals tend to opt for low-effort choices in daily scenarios unless strong rewards are guaranteed. These insights could help develop targeted treatments aimed at enhancing motivation and sustaining recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Motivation Lingers:&lt;/strong&gt; Even after recovery, effortful choices are often avoided unless rewards are large and certain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relapse Risk Factor:&lt;/strong&gt; Persistent motivational deficits may increase vulnerability to depressive relapse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target for Treatm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Elsevier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New research shows that individuals who have recovered from depression are generally less willing to exert effort to pursue potential rewards compared to those who have never experienced depression, unless the rewards are large and highly likely. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging&lt;/em&gt;, published by Elsevier, provides deeper insights into subtle motivational deficits that persist in individuals who have recovered from depression, potentially explaining relapse vulnerability and guiding targeted treatment for sustained recovery and overall patient well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who have experienced depression in the past are often at a higher risk of experiencing another depressive episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite improvements in mood after recovery from depression, they continue to exhibit some cognitive and motivational deficits, such as alterations in reward processing, impairing daily activities and functional recovery. The reasons behind this remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers of the current study wanted to better understand the hidden processes in decision-making and motivation that might contribute to relapse vulnerability and identify ways to help people stay healthy after recovering from depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead investigator Diego A. Pizzagalli, PhD, formerly Center for Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Research, McLean Hospital (Belmont, MA) and Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, now Founding Director, Noel Drury, MD, Institute for Translational Depression Discoveries, Distinguished Professor, Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior &amp;amp; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Noel Drury MD Endowed Chair, University of California at Irvine, says, ”Imagine an everyday scenario: deciding whether to meet a friend after work or simply stay home because going out feels too exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals with a history of depression might more often opt for the less effortful choice—staying home—missing out on rewarding experiences and social interactions. Over time, repeatedly choosing the low-effort path could unintentionally reinforce behaviors or thought patterns that increase the risk of falling back into depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research entailed asking individuals who had previously experienced depression (but have recovered and are not currently using medication) and a group of participants who had never experienced depression to make a series of choices between low-effort tasks with smaller rewards and high-effort tasks with potentially larger rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given evidence that antidepressants can blunt reward-related neural processes, only unmedicated individuals with remitted major depressive disorder were included to minimize potential confounding effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choices were then analyzed using computational methods to understand motivation and decision-making. The most significant results showed that recovered individuals generally preferred less effortful options, but notably, they became equally or even more motivated than healthy individuals when rewards were large and highly certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that while motivation may be reduced in everyday tasks, providing clear and highly valuable incentives can effectively boost motivation in individuals with a history of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Editor-in-Chief of &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging&lt;/em&gt; Cameron S. Carter, MD, University of California Irvine, notes, “Reduced motivation is a core feature of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Utilizing the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task test, researchers examined how individuals weigh the potential benefits of rewards against the cognitive or physical effort required to obtain them, providing valuable insights into motivational processes underlying major depressive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings from this study suggest a nuanced picture of decision-making in recovered depression, highlighting conditions under which motivation may actually surpass typical levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First author Manuel Kuhn, PhD, Center for Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Research, McLean Hospital (Belmont, MA) and Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, concludes, “This research is novel because it applies advanced computational modeling techniques, allowing us to identify latent decision-making processes—such as how reward magnitude and effort cost are integrated—that conventional analytical methods have not yet been able to uncover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is particularly important now, as it provides deeper insights into subtle motivational deficits that persist in individuals who have recovered from depression, potentially explaining their vulnerability to relapse triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By pinpointing these underlying motivational mechanisms, our findings can inform the development of more targeted treatments designed to enhance sustained recovery and overall patient well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this depression and motivation research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0a626779676f6e636b4a6f66796f7c636f7824696567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eileen Leahy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://elsevier.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elsevier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Eileen Leahy – Elsevier&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2025.02.006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Computational Phenotyping of Effort-Based Decision Making in Unmedicated Adults with Remitted Depression&lt;/a&gt;” by Diego A.

Yet, the extent to which this deficit persists in remitted MDD (rMDD) remains unclear. Here, we examined effort-based decision making as one aspect of amotivation in rMDD using computational phenotyping to characterize decision-making processes and strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0020"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unmedicated adults with rMDD (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 40) and healthy control (HC) participants (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 68) completed the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated-measures analysis of variance and computational modeling—including hierarchical drift diffusion modeling and subjective value modeling—were applied to quantify decision-making dynamics in effort allocation across different reward magnitudes and probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relative to HC participants, participants with rMDD made overall fewer hard task choices, with an attenuated effect when accounting for anhedonia. However, specific to high reward, high probability conditions, participants with rMDD chose to expend effort more often than HC participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was supported by the drift diffusion model results revealing that participants with rMDD showed a drift rate biased toward selecting the easy task, counteracted by heightened influence of reward probability and magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probed with the subjective value model, this was not driven by group differences in decision strategies with respect to magnitude and probability information use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these findings suggest that while individuals with rMDD exhibit persistent motivational deficits, they retain a heightened sensitivity to high-value rewards, requiring more substantial or certain rewards to engage in effortful tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern may reflect impairments in reward processing and effort-cost computations, contributing to motivational dysfunction. Targeting reward sensitivity and effort allocation could be valuable for interventions aimed at preventing MDD relapse.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 16:01:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9xR3U3Z3I2Wm05Z0dvUmE1MlhILXlUNm0tNm1md2tRTUZKZTlNVXJ5TzhlaUc5emllTTgtcTVRcEJnM1lhZkVxSnFOc3BkcnUwajFQNk9Qa1loR1VQcHBMdjJCZUNtV09RNEdzd0otMG5BdWZkcDM0</guid></item><item><title>有些苍蝇会失眠以抵御寄生虫- Ars Technica | Some flies go insomniac to ward off parasites - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPUmdNSVZVb0pNNWNwQjUtblVxeGlYTWJTWGxYaUpaalI0UktFY01ISHFTREFLWEV0VzJyRldUYjJGM3V4SDl6cTFtYXJfRGpvSVQ0dlF5ZmRqWXM3UXE1WXBSV1hTRWdtbjdQSGlNMGdZQy0tT2htX1NqZTBwYmJRZnpHaWhSanNLTkFPV3VYVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Those genes associated with metabolism were upregulated, meaning they showed an increase in activity. An observed loss of body fat and protein reserves was evidently a trade-off for resistance to mites. This suggests there was increased lipolysis, or the breakdown of fats, and proteolysis, the breakdown of proteins, in resistant lines of flies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parasite paranoia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The depletion of nutrients could make fruit flies less likely to survive even without mites feeding off them, but their tenaciousness when it comes to staying up through the night suggests that being parasitized by mites is still the greater risk. Because mite-resistant flies did not sleep, their oxygen consumption and activity also increased during the night to levels no different from those of control group flies during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping mites away involves moving around so the fly can buzz off if mites crawl too close. Knowing this, Benoit wanted to see what would happen if the resistant flies’ movement was restricted. It was doom. When the flies were restrained, the mite-resistant flies were as susceptible to mites as the controls. Activity alone was important for resisting mites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since mites are ectoparasites, or external parasites (as opposed to internal parasites like tapeworms), potential hosts like flies can benefit from hypervigilance. Sleep is typically beneficial to a host invaded by an internal parasite because it increases the immune response. Unfortunately for the flies, sleeping would only make them an easy meal for mites. Keeping both &lt;a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/fruit-flies-have-super-resolution-stereo-vision#:~:text=The%20team%20discovered%20that%20flies,surroundings%20than%20previously%20thought%20possible"&gt;stereoscopic eyes&lt;/a&gt; out for an external parasite means there is no time left for sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The pattern of reduced sleep likely allows the flies to be more responsive during encounters with mites during the night,” the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44323-025-00031-7?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=oa_20250402&amp;amp;utm_content=10.1038/s44323-025-00031-7"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in their study, which was recently published in Biological Timing and Sleep. “There could be differences in sleep occurring during the day, but these differences may be less important as &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster &lt;/i&gt;sleeps much less during the day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fruit flies aren’t the only creatures with sleep patterns that parasites disrupt. Evidence of shifts in sleep and rest in birds and bats has been shown to happen when there is a risk of parasitism after dark. For the flies, exhaustion has the upside of better fertility if they manage to avoid bites, so a mate must be worth all those sleepless nights.&lt;/p&gt;

Biological age, measured through biomarkers like lung function and cholesterol, reflects how the body’s systems are aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers observed that individuals with higher biological age also showed brain changes, such as reduced gray matter, which are linked to dementia.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the rising impact of dementia around the world, identifying risk factors and implementing preventive measures is essential,” said study author Yacong Bo, PhD, of Zhengzhou University in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While none of us can change our chronological age, we can influence our biological age through lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 280,918 participants in a United Kingdom database who were an average chronological age of 57 at the start of the study and did not have dementia at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were followed for an average of 14 years. During that time, 4,770 people developed dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used two methods to measure biological age. In addition to lung function, blood pressure and cholesterol, the methods measured other biomarkers in the blood, such as average cell volume and white blood cell count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These methods show how different parts of the body, like metabolism, immunity, liver, kidneys, heart and other systems, work together as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the people who later developed dementia had an average chronological age of 65 at the start of the study compared to 57 for those who stayed free of dementia, their average biological age was 55 by one of the methods, compared to 45 for those with no dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When dividing the participants into four groups based on biological age, researchers found that those with the most advanced biological age were about 30% more likely to develop dementia than those in the lowest group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results adjusted for other factors that could affect the risk of dementia, such as age, education level and smoking status.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that people with advanced biological age also had changes in their brain that are associated with dementia, such as loss of gray matter volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These brain structure changes explain some, but not all, of the association between advanced biological age and dementia,” Bo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results support the hypothesis that advanced biological age may contribute to the development of dementia by causing a widespread change in brain structures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study was that participants in the database tend to be more health conscious than the general population, so they may be less likely to develop dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by Henan Province and Zhengzhou city governments in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this aging and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1062647563637d717e5071717e3e737f7d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Renee Tessman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Renee Tessman – AAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 15:31:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1YTUYzcDlxM19vRzZMc25Mdl9EdkZJSGxtRGcxSmxMQmE5TjJkZ01SSmtBTmxkNTVvdjhpVW5ZUzdaTGRoMUtWUWhDbTRwNWt0aS0yUmRMSjMtdzQtNktlRnl5T3gwdlQtM0daYXpwcENUdw</guid></item><item><title>运动是帕金森病的完美解药吗？神经病学家解释说，分享要遵循的锻炼常规-印度斯坦时报 | Is exercise the perfect antidote to Parkinson's disease?

Without vaccination, it is thought to be the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14668283/major-usa-airport-red-alert-passenger-virus-chicago.html"&gt;most infectious disease in the world&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The unidentified patient was among a crowd of 39,244 people at the Texas Rangers vs Los Angeles Dodgers on April 19&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes tiny white spots inside the mouth, flat red spots on the neck, torso, arms, legs, and feet, ear infections and an intense fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If one person has measles, up to 90 percent of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average measles patient would infect up to 18 others if they were also not vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who had the original Covid strain, by comparison, infected on average just two people, though this number rose considerably with new variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the locations the Texas patient visited include Guitars and Growlers restaurant in Flower Mound, a WalMart store in Lewisville, Rangers Republic at Texas Live! restaurant in Arlington and Pho Tay Do restaurant in Richardson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anyone who develops symptoms is encouraged to immediately contact health services for treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Matt Richardson, Denton County Public Health Director has since asked residents to ensure they are vaccinated in a statement.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He noted: 'Today's case is further evidence that measles cases are on the rise – and the DFW area is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While we haven't linked this case to an existing outbreak, it highlights two realities: vaccines are important and if you have signs and symptoms, you should be tested.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC states that the best way to protect children and adults against measles is to get two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The measles vaccine is 93 percent effective at preventing infections after one dose, and 97 percent effective after two doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of when to get vaccinated, experts say children need two doses of MMR vaccine: the first dose at age 12-15 months, and the second dose at age 4-6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally.

Bowel cancer cases have doubled in people under 55 over the past 20 years as per &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, a disturbing trend that point towards the deadly cancer's growing threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2515569/#:~:text=The%20fact%20that%20only%205,major%20opportunities%20for%20preventing%20cancer" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;suggest up to 90% of colorectal cancers are due to environmental and lifestyle factors, which makes them highly preventable. Bowel cancer remains one of the most prevalent cancers globally, responsible for over 1.9 million new cases and nearly 904,000 deaths in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not just bowel cancer, other types of cancers including breast, bowel, lungs, ovaries, and pancreas are also on rise among youth. Recent research published in The Lancet Oncology has brought renewed attention to the alarming surge in colorectal cancer among younger adults, particularly in high-income Western countries, where trends for older adults have stabilised or even decreased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts suggest that lifestyle factors such as poor diet, physical inactivity, and rising obesity rates could be contributing to this disturbing pattern. With young women in certain countries experiencing faster increases than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bacterial toxin&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in Nature has identified colibactin, a DNA-damaging toxin produced by certain strains of E. coli, as a potential culprit behind the surge in early-onset bowel cancer. Researchers from the University of California, San Diego, analyzed tumor samples from nearly 1,000 colorectal cancer patients across four continents and found that younger patients (under 40) were 3 to 5 times more likely to carry mutations linked to exposure to colibactin than those aged 70 and above. This suggests that gut microbiota imbalances could be playing a bigger role than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ultraprocessed foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munching on ultraprocessed foods like packaged snacks, sweetened beverages, and ready-made meals could be fueling the pandemic of colorectal cancer. Researchers at USF Health and Tampa General Hospital Cancer Institute have found that Western diets having ultra-processed foods and unhealthy oils could trigger chronic inflammation that drives tumour growth. Researchers, funded by a $3.1 million NIH grant, have made significant strides in understanding colorectal cancer. Their first study, published in Gut, explores how processed foods may hinder the body's natural healing processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stress and mental health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another contributing factor to the rise in colorectal and other cancers among younger adults could be the growing impact of stress and mental health disorders. Chronic stress and anxiety can trigger inflammation in the body, weaken the immune system, and alter the gut microbiota, all of which may contribute to cancer development. Recent studies have shown a link between mental health struggles and an increased risk of cancer, with stress potentially accelerating tumor growth by suppressing the body’s ability to fight off abnormal cells. According to the National Institutes of Health, chronic stress can suppress cancer-related immune responses by altering various immune cells, thereby potentially promoting cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is bowel cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowel cancer also known as colorectal cancer affects the large bowel, which is made up of the colon and rectum. It begins in the lining of the large bowel (colon) or back passage (rectum).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One should not ignore changes in bowel habits, such as more frequent diarrhea or constipation, rectal bleeding or blood in the stool. Stomach cramps, gas or pain could also be a contributing factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important sign not to miss is the feeling that the bowel doesn't empty all the way during a bowel movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weakness or tiredness, and losing weight without trying are other signs of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;What's causing heart attacks in youngsters?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 15:14:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>《如此之小》评论：生死攸关的细菌--《华尔街日报》 | ‘So Very Small’ Review: Germs of Life and Death -

The mother-of-three has previously said she lost 'too much' weight while on Ozempic. Right, cosmetic experts say the weight loss drug has caused sagging around her lip borders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All three women have spoken openly about using weight loss medications, with the slimming results clearly visible.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of male celebrities, Dr Green adds: 'Actor and playwright Harvey Fierstein has also been open about taking Zepbound, another weight loss medication, which has led to increased sagging skin and jowls in the face after he lost a staggering 120lbs.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic, along with similar drugs Mounjaro and Wegovy, is approved to treat type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-d3311cc0-2755-11f0-b076-a9400e4cbdee"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; but is widely used off-label for weight loss - especially among celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Figures from 2024, which are likely an undercount, suggest one in eight Americans have taken a GLP-1 drug like Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to the growing concern about 'Ozempic mouth', Dr Green reveals that she has had an increasing number of patients asking about dermal &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/fillers/index.html" id="mol-5fcb3700-26a8-11f0-8cff-2fcb153fa254" class=""&gt;fillers&lt;/a&gt; around the mouth area to help restore lost volume. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The expert says that Ozempic depletes the subcutaneous fat. This is the visible fat layer just under the skin which you can pinch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By depleting the subcutaneous fat, the skin appears thinner, with more wrinkling and often lipstick lines,' New York-based plastic surgeon Dr Barry Weintraub told this website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fillers - gel-like substances injected beneath the skin to restore lost volume, smooth lines and enhance facial contours - can 'restore volume to the face, smooth the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, and plump the skin to create a more youthful-looking appearance,' Dr Green explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just as the number of people taking semaglutide (the active substance in Ozempic) has skyrocketed, the number of women using fillers has increased close to threefold in the US over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2010, 1.8 million filler procedures were performed, increasing to 5.3 million in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fxing Ozempic mouth can be an expensive task, with filler costing between $700 and $2,000 per syringe, depending on the location and provider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another treatment Dr Green recommends as a fix is Thermage, which is a non-invasive radiofrequency treatment that uses heat to tighten skin and improve its appearance. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Like many experts, Dr Green has noticed a number of celebrities suffering from Ozempic mouth as the result of taking weight loss drugs, with one of her standout examples being Whoopi Goldberg. Signs of Ozempic mouth include deep lines around the lips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rebel Wilson dropped more than 70lbs back in 2021 after turning to Ozempic, and she's committed to keeping the weight off. Sagging around the chin area is one sign of Ozempic mouth the experts point to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It works by stimulating collagen production, which helps to reduce wrinkles, improve skin laxity, and create a more youthful look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Green adds: 'As the body's collagen levels increase, the skin becomes firmer and tighter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, it takes four to six months to see results from Thermage, after which the results can last for approximately one and a half years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Patients on Ozempic should ideally undergo a Thermage procedure early in treatment or before treatment begins to prevent the development of loose, sagging skin on the face.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But like filler, Thermage can be pricey, with the 30 minute treatment costing between $1,500 and $3,500. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To minimize the &lt;span&gt;aging effects on your smile and mouth due to Ozempic, Dr Green recommends 'consulting with your doctor about adjusting your medication dosage to prioritize gradual weight loss rather than rapid weight loss.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meanwhile, Dr Ilana Ramer Bass of Mount Sinai Health System told this website she recommends eating 'small, well-balanced meals with a focus on fiber and protein' to help keep the skin hydrated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She adds: 'Before any skin conditions develop, causing wrinkles or dryness, I would also recommend seeing a dermatologist before turning to cosmetic surgery.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In terms of male celebrities, Dr Green says: 'Actor and playwright Harvey Fierstein has also been open about taking Zepbound, another weight loss medication, which has led to increased sagging skin and jowls in the face.' Fierstein lost 120lbs in total thanks to weight loss medication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic mouth is just the latest body part to be warped because of the rapid and drastic weight-loss turbocharged by Ozempic and similar drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Barry Weintraub, a New York-based board certified plastic surgeon, previously told DailyMail.com a loss of fat can impact water retention in the body and cause excessive sagging in the feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fans speculated stars like Sharon Osbourne and Oprah Winfrey - both of whom have admitted to taking weight-loss dugs - were among the first to show signs of the surprising side effect deemed 'Ozempic feet'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ozempic face' has increasingly been seen on celebrities, who look gaunt with sunken eyes, hollow cheekbones and sagging faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Katy Perry, Scott Disick and Jessica Simpson have all been labeled as suffering from the side effect after fans noticed their slimmed-down looks while the stars were out and about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the term 'Ozempic butt' has been coined to describe the deflated look of a person's buttocks after GLP-1 weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some users who have lost large amounts of weight said their backsides have now 'completely disappeared' and shrunk so much they can 'feel every bone'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some even said the problem was so bad they were constantly covering up their buttocks because they are self conscious of the way it looks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 14:35:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxPM0RfR1RjOEJ5NWI2RmZkcHZleGFjR1pxTmFXRGpXZzBrLWhQeGwxTU9mRlBzOTFqMl9ETjVNNDZOdFNmTGtfQU9fUzhpVmV0SUNLakV2UTZGWHBoT3JOVUtZdlVYNUFGWHM5MXJtZnBfaXEtcXkwS09vZjgwSUV0NVhKTkp5NlVKYXF5UHpmbGUxd3huS0U2UlBhMk0wRUxSUGE3dXBTVVNzNjNnLUhhZTRVc0tUQdIBuwFBVV95cUxPVDh3cXRvT0VFZ29GT00xLW42cjJYMUoxQlQwdUp0TVEzdUxKWDVsVjlld2tQU0kzcnIyQW9GTWdxb0NoejhtMndLT05CTUhSSkxXVUhfeHZkbDRLLS1fV0doUG9wS2taWmJsVG1HWTNEYkNqdkx6ZkJqUV9aUnpKTk1rTjQwNHRJaGhfZlA4Q1h6dDJMUW1TWFZ4cXRweFhTUnpDWWo5Q2ZQUl9KOGlCLW9sNWdVZmJ0enZR</guid></item><item><title>与心理健康障碍相关的免疫系统-神经科学新闻 | Immune System Tied to Mental Health Disorders -

Using Mendelian randomisation, scientists linked 29 immune-related proteins to seven neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting the brain is not the only organ involved in mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 20 of these proteins are targets of drugs used for other diseases, opening potential avenues for new treatments. These findings challenge long-standing brain-only models and point to mental health as a whole-body issue shaped by both brain and immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Involvement Found:&lt;/strong&gt; 29 immune proteins linked to seven mental health conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug Target Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; 20 proteins are already targeted by existing drugs for other diseases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rethinking Mental Health:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings challenge traditional brain-only views, suggesting whole-body involvement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Bristol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depression, schizophrenia and other mental health conditions affect 1 in 4 people in their lifetime, but mechanisms underlying these conditions are poorly understood. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research led by researchers at the University of Bristol has linked the body’s immune response with schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, depression, and bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109410"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince.jpg" alt="This shows the outline of a person and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mental-health-immune-system-neurosceince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers found a potential causal role of 29 immune response related proteins in these 7 neuropsychiatric conditions. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study demonstrates mental health conditions might be affected by the whole body as well as changes in the brain. The findings could pave the way for better treatments of some mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people with depression or schizophrenia are treated with drugs that work on brain chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine. However, 1 in 3 people with these conditions do not benefit from these treatments, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study led by Dr Christina Dardani and Professor Golam Khandaker in Bristol’s MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) used Mendelian randomisation – a computational approach that uses genetic information from large datasets – to examine whether immunological proteins are likely to be involved in 7 neuropsychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team looked at the relationship of 735 immune response related proteins measurable in human blood with depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, autism, and ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found a potential causal role of 29 immune response related proteins in these 7 neuropsychiatric conditions. From the identified biomarkers, 20 showed potential as targets of drugs approved for other conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These biomarkers could potentially be used in the future for novel therapeutics in the area of mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest a fundamental change in the understanding of causal mechanisms for neuropsychiatric conditions. To date causal explanations for depression and schizophrenia have been predicted on monoamine neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and dopamine, but this study suggests that overactivity of the immune system could also contribute to the cause of mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golam Khandaker, Professor of Psychiatry and Immunology and MRC Investigator in the Bristol Medical School: Population Health Sciences (PHS), said: “Our study demonstrates that inflammation in the brain &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the body might influence the risk of mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings challenge the centuries-old Cartesian dichotomy between the body and the mind, and suggests that we should consider depression and schizophrenia as conditions affecting the &lt;em&gt;whole &lt;/em&gt;person.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is to examine biomarkers identified through genetic analysis using other methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes research based on health records, animal studies, and  proof-of-concept clinical trials in humans, to further evaluate causality; understand precise mechanisms from inflammation to symptoms of mental health conditions; and therapeutic potential – does modulating immune pathways improve symptoms of these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was funded by a Medical Research Council programme grant for immunopsychiatry to Professor Golam Khandaker.

			&lt;p&gt;Scientists may have identified a way to naturally regulate blood sugar levels and sugar cravings in a similar fashion to drugs like Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice and humans, the key to unlocking this natural process was found to be a gut microbe and its metabolites – the compounds it produces during digestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By increasing the abundance of this one gut microbe in diabetic mice, researchers led by a team at Jiangnan University in China &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01902-8"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; they can "orchestrate the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormone that is naturally produced by the body and which helps regulate blood sugar levels and feelings of fullness. GLP-1's release is stimulated by certain foods and gut microbes, and its mechanism of action is mimicked by drugs like semaglutide (the ingredient behind Ozempic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k1j6Sw8vPE0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="159966" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; typically have impaired GLP-1 function, leading to issues with blood sugar control, which is why &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-protein-discovery-could-rival-ozempic-with-fewer-side-effects"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and other GLP-1 agonists work as treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These drugs mimic natural processes in the body, and while they have proved very effective, some researchers want to figure out how to get the body to produce more GLP-1 on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A growing body of research has revealed that our cravings for dietary components originate from signals sent from the gut, a key organ in transmitting dietary preferences," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01902-8"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; the authors in their paper published in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"However, which genes, gut flora, and metabolites in the gut microenvironment are involved in the regulation of sugar preference is currently unclear."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new research suggests gut microbes like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phocaeicola_vulgatus"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bacteroides vulgatus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and their metabolites may help shape a person's sweet tooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In experiments, if mice could not produce a gut protein, called Ffar4, the researchers found the gut colonies of &lt;em&gt;B. vulgatus&lt;/em&gt; shrank. This, in turn, decreased the release of a hormone called FGF21, which is tied to sugar cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149407" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149407" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-642x366.png" alt="New Study Hints at Natural Alternative to Ozempic Hiding in The Gut" class="wp-image-149407 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-642x366.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-729x415.png 729w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-768x437.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-1536x875.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-2048x1167.png 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-600x342.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149407" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Diagram of GLP-1 agonist pathway and FGF21 pathway. (Ayesh, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/12/10/2328"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biomedicines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2024)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In studies of mice taking GLP-1 agonists, researchers have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10006666/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; the drugs stimulate FGF21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in humans, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrendo.2017.62"&gt;some studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that those with genetic variants for the FGF21 hormone are about 20 percent more likely to be top-ranking consumers of sweet foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a blood analysis of 60 participants with type 2 diabetes and 24 healthy controls, the researchers in China &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01902-8"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that Ffar4 mutations, which reduce FGF21 production, are linked to an increased preference for sugar, "which may be an important contributor to the development of diabetes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, the gut microbiome could be a key mediator of that process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, the research team found that when mice were treated with a metabolite of &lt;i&gt;B. vulgatus,&lt;/i&gt; it boosted GLP-1 secretion, which then also triggered the secretion of FGF21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, this meant more blood sugar control and fewer sugar cravings in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether the same will extend to humans remains to be seen, but the authors &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01902-8"&gt;claim&lt;/a&gt; their study "provides a strategy for diabetes prevention."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01902-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was first published in January 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Traits such as higher neuroticism, higher agreeableness, and lower conscientiousness were particularly associated with general mental health risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that while personality is a strong predictor, it is only one factor among many, including genetics and life experiences. The findings suggest that understanding personality could help create better-targeted mental health interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personality Predicts Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; About 25% of mental health risk is tied to personality traits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroticism Linked to Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher neuroticism, lower conscientiousness, and higher agreeableness predicted general mental health issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Factors Matter:&lt;/strong&gt; Personality is a strong factor but does not solely determine mental health outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Edinburgh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common mental health conditions are more closely related to people’s personalities than previously thought, a study suggests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personality traits explain about a quarter of the overall risk of mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and phobias, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say the findings show personality is one of the most reliable predictors for the onset and persistence of mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Edinburgh and the University of Tartu in Estonia analysed data from more than 16,000 members of the Estonian Biobank – a collection of health data from volunteers across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They surveyed people’s personality according to the five traits psychologists define as the main dimensions of human personality: extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, openness to experience and agreeableness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also looked at more nuanced personality traits – such as tendencies to feel embarrassed, needing reassurance and needing help from others – as predictors of general mental health problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at both the general risk of experiencing different types of mental health problems and the risk of some specific problems that only some people experience, such as fear, sleeplessness, fatigue, inattention, and hyperactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant described their personality traits and mental health, and each participant was also rated by someone else who knew them well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that personality traits were more strongly related to mental health problems than suggested by previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 25 per cent of the differences in people’s risk of mental health problems could be traced to their personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of the general risk, personality traits explained another quarter of the risk for specific mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with a higher general mental health risk tended to have higher neuroticism – a tendency to feel negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also tended to have higher agreeableness – a positive orientation towards other people – and lower conscientiousness – a tendency to be organised and hardworking.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, specific mental health problems varied in their associations with personality traits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some areas of mental health, such as sleep problems, were not particularly strongly correlated with any aspect of personality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Researcher, Professor René Mõttus, of the University of Edinburgh’s School of School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences, said: “By combining data from two sources, we were able to overcome common problems in personality assessments, such as response bias and other types of measurement error. This allowed us to estimate the associations much more accurately.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers stress that people’s personalities do not determine their mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author, Helo Liis Soodla, of the University of Tartu, said: “Many people whose traits might statistically predict poor mental health report great well-being. Conversely, many people who experience mental health problems at some point in their lives do not appear to be at risk based on their personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In any given individual, a number of things can affect mental health, from genetic risk variants to stressful childhood events. Each factor on its own accounts for only a tiny proportion of the risk of poor mental health. And much is simply down to luck.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say the more we know about the potential of traits to increase mental health risk, the more likely we are to be able to design successful interventions to reduce the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was funded by the Estonian Research Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health and personality research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9cf6f3fdf2f2f9b2f1f3eeeef5eff3f2dcf9f8b2fdffb2e9f7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Joanne Morrison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ed.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Joanne Morrison – University of Edinburgh&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/abn0000967" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Assessing the Overlap of Personality Traits and Internalizing Psychopathology Using Multi-Informant Data: Two Sides of the Same Coin?&lt;/a&gt;” by René Mõttus et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessing the Overlap of Personality Traits and Internalizing Psychopathology Using Multi-Informant Data: Two Sides of the Same Coin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personality and psychopathology share a hierarchical dimensional structure, developmental trajectories and correlations with varied outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, quantifying the extent and details of their direct empirical overlap has been hindered by overreliance on self-reports and broad construct domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using multimethod data, we estimated the Big Five personality domains’ and nuances’ (items’) “true” correlations (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;true&lt;/sub&gt;) with, and true predictive accuracy (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;truePRED&lt;/sub&gt;) for, various psychopathology state domains, free of single-method and occasion-specific biases, random error, and direct content overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our sample included Estonian Biobank participants (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 16,226) who completed psychopathology and comprehensive personality questionnaires, and whose personality traits were also rated by close informants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personality nuances out-predicted the Big Five domains for psychopathology, with items’ &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;truePRED&lt;/sub&gt; = .31 … .58 for specific psychopathology domains of distress, fear, inattention, hyperactivity, insomnia, and fatigue, and &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;truePRED&lt;/sub&gt; = .52 for the general &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual items had various meaningful &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;true&lt;/sub&gt;s with the psychopathology domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the Big Five, neuroticism was the strongest correlate of distress (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;true&lt;/sub&gt; = .29) and fear (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;true&lt;/sub&gt; = .13), while inattention was most correlated with conscientiousness (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;true&lt;/sub&gt; = −.56), hyperactivity with extraversion (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;true&lt;/sub&gt; = .25), fatigue with openness (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;true&lt;/sub&gt; = .12), and insomnia with conscientiousness (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;true&lt;/sub&gt; = .12).

Experts say there are number of things that can serve to damage the organs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In some cases damage to the kidneys can lead to kidney disease. According to the NHS, chronic kidney disease is a common condition often associated with getting older but lifestyle changes can help to prevent it from occurring and certain habits can lead to damage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Eating ultra-processed foods&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eating ultra-processed foods has been linked to health conditions that increase the risk of kidney disease, including high blood pressure and obesity. These foodstuff typically have more than one ingredient that you wouldn't usually find in a kitchen, including additives and preservatives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In a &lt;a href="https://www.ajkd.org/article/S0272-6386(22)00648-5/abstract" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers found that people with the highest levels of processed food consumption have a 24 per cent greater risk of chronic kidney disease. Kidney Research UK suggests maintaining a healthy diet with a wide variety of foods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31556706" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

When you’re dehydrated, your urine becomes more concentrated, and you’re more likely to experience kidney stones or infections that can damage the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; According to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dehydration/symptoms-causes/syc-20354086" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, long-lasting or repeated bouts of dehydration lead to potential "urinary tract infections, kidney stones and even kidney failure". &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Not exercising enough&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the NHS, regular exercise should help lower your blood pressure. This can then reduce the risk of developing kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recommending how much exercise is needed to stay health, the NHS say &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/physical-activity-guidelines-for-adults-aged-19-to-64/#:~:text=do%20at%20least%20150%20minutes,not%20moving%20with%20some%20activity" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;: "At least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as cycling or fast walking, every week is recommended, as well as strength exercises on 2 or more days a week that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms)."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Research published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209525462300073X" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;2024&lt;/a&gt; showed that physical activity was associated with a lower risk of developing kidney disease. That includes both low and moderate intensity exercise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Not being careful with painkillers&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/kidney-disease/prevention/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; says that kidney disease can be caused by taking too many non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen, or taking them for longer than recommended. "If you need to take painkillers, make sure you follow the instructions that come with the medicine," it says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Eating too much salt and sugar&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; Too much salt can help to increase blood pressure. The &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/news-stories/10-common-habits-may-harm-your-kidneys" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;National Kidney Foundation&lt;/a&gt; says that while sugar doesn’t damage the kidneys, too much sugar intake in people with diabetes can lead to high blood sugar that can damage the kidneys. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many foods available in supermarkets contain added sugar or high amounts of salt, so it's worth checking the labels when you do your big shop.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Smoking and drinking&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31556733" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The NHS says that too much alcohol can cause your blood pressure and cholesterol levels to rise to unhealthy levels. Men and women are advised not to regularly drink more than 14 units a week, about the equivalent of six pints of average-strength beer or 10 small glasses of low-strength wine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smoking, meanwhile, increases your risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks or strokes, which is associated with a higher risk of chronic kidney disease&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kidneyresearchuk.org/kidney-health-information/about-kidney-disease/am-i-at-risk/smoking-and-kidney-disease/?_gl=1*1xgu273*_up*MQ..*_ga*MjU4OTA4MTYwLjE3NDYxNzM1ODg.*_ga_737HY1XF35*MTc0NjE3NTYyOS4yLjEuMTc0NjE3NTYzOC4wLjAuMA.." rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Kidney Research UK&lt;/a&gt; suggests that smoking can increase the risk of harming the kidneys and developing some kidney cancers. It can also help to cause or advance diabetic kidney disease, the "most common" cause of kidney failure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Not sleeping enough (or getting too much)&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; While vital to ensure rest and allow our body to repair, sleep can also affect the functioning of the kidneys. According to &lt;a href="https://kidneycareuk.org/kidney-disease-information/about-kidney-health/10-healthy-habits-for-happy-kidneys/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Kidney Care UK&lt;/a&gt; "your kidneys’ function is regulated by your sleep-wake cycle, so poor sleep may impact their ability to do their job". &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6411180/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Researchers&lt;/a&gt; linked poor sleep to increased risk of chronic kidney disease, finding that participants in the study who slept for fewer than four hours or more than eight hours had an increased risk of incident CKD, compared to those who slept six to eight hours a night. People who struggle to get enough rest are advised to check their sleeping habits and environment and consult their doctor if they continue to struggle. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Signs of kidney disease&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/kidney-health-warning-signs#:~:text=Kidney%20function%20is%20closely%20tied,pain%20or%20burning%20while%20urinating" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Healthline&lt;/a&gt;, many people with kidney disease don’t have symptoms until kidney damage is more severe. Some examples of kidney disease symptoms are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;urinating more or less often than usual&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;foamy urine&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;fatigue&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;weakness&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;nausea or vomiting&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;dry or itchy skin&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;swelling, especially in your lower limbs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;muscle cramping&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;difficulty sleeping&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;reduced appetite&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;unintended weight loss&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 12:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxQTlBIZzRuaFk4ejVMRHNVd1pzemUySzY2cjZZeGowMWxnNDB3UWpCWEJjMGtHT0hTVlVHSktpdHh1SUpUU0l3U3ktN0ZxeGtsS1BaOGttbk82bTdOX3NJaFI2SWdvR3hzTFNqVndDaURPanp3VDVubmQ5Um9oQUxTcWswV01mYkE</guid></item><item><title>研究挑战意识起源的领先理论-神经科学新闻 | Study Challenges Leading Theories On Consciousness Origins - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE1OM01ra3VKYktYYTlaamZsaUxKR3VSZnRGNUtHWGFjUjhhM0NuZzc0Z2hFcWwtSWNuZXE3LWlqQ29KZlR3NFpmS0pwNW1ucFFxcklJUGFwZFFOSDNhWWpyUDBWVTdGQnZCeUhSNEwwUmNsdWYyRnpuaA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A landmark study tested two leading theories of consciousness — Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) — but found neither definitively explained conscious experience. While IIT emphasizes deep integration of brain regions and GNWT highlights widespread broadcasting of information, data from 256 human subjects did not fully support either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, results suggested sensory and perceptual processing areas, rather than the prefrontal cortex, may play a more central role in conscious experience. This discovery could advance efforts to detect covert consciousness in unresponsive patients and reshape future research directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Clear Winner:&lt;/strong&gt; Neither Integrated Information Theory nor Global Neuronal Workspace Theory fully explained consciousness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensory Areas Highlighted:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings suggest consciousness may be rooted in sensory processing, not prefrontal control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding consciousness pathways may aid detection of covert awareness in brain injury patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Allen Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An experiment seven years in the making has uncovered new insights into the nature of consciousness and challenges two prominent, competing scientific theories: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published today in&lt;em&gt; Nature&lt;/em&gt; and mark a pivotal moment in the goal to understand the elusive origins consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IIT suggests that consciousness emerges when information inside a system (like the brain) is highly connected and unified, for as long as the information is consciously perceived, acting as a single whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, GNWT suggests a network of brain areas will spotlight important pieces of information in the brain—bringing it to the forefront of our minds—broadcasting it widely the moment it enters consciousness, and this produces conscious experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two competing theories were tested against one another in 2019 in a collaborative experiment involving 256 human subjects, and the findings were just released. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adversarial collaboration fits within the Allen Institute’s mission of team science, open science and big science, in service of one of the biggest, and most long-standing, intellectual challenges of humanity: the Mind-Body Problem,” said Christof Koch, Ph.D., meritorious investigator at the Allen Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unravelling this mystery is the passion of my entire life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Findings &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research showed that there’s functional connection between neurons in early visual areas of the brain (the areas that process vision, which are at the back of the brain) and the frontal areas of the brain, helping us understand how our perceptions tie to our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings de-emphasize the importance of the prefrontal cortex in consciousness, suggesting that while it’s important for reasoning and planning, consciousness itself may be linked with sensory processing and perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, intelligence is about doing while consciousness is about being. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;This discovery has implications for how we understand consciousness and may shed light on disorders of consciousness such as comas or vegetative states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying where consciousness comes from could help detect “covert consciousness” in unresponsive patients with severe injuries—a condition known to occur in about one-quarter of cases as reported in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine &lt;/em&gt;last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neither Theory Came Out on Top  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrated Information Theory (IIT) says consciousness comes from the interaction and cooperation of various parts of the brain as they work together to integrate information, like teamwork. It arises from how these parts are connected and how they share information with each other rather than any one individual area or part of the brain generating consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, however, did not find enough lasting connections in the back of the brain to support this idea. Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) supports the idea that consciousness happens in the front of the brain, but the study didn’t find enough support for this idea either. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was clear that no single experiment would decisively refute either theory. The theories are just too different in their assumptions and explanatory goals, and the available experimental methods too coarse, to enable one theory to conclusively win out over another,” said Anil Seth, Ph.D., a professor of cognitive and computational neuroscience at the University of Sussex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having said all this, the findings of the collaboration remain extremely valuable – much has been learned about both theories and about where and when in the brain information about visual experience can be decoded from. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 256 subjects, which is unprecedented for this kind of experiment. Researchers showed them various visual stimuli and then used three common human brain measurement tools that track blood flow as well as magnetic and electrical activity to study their brains while they looked at the stimuli. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highly collaborative experiment is the result of a large-scale, open science collaboration that began at a workshop at the Allen Institute in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This innovative approach brought together researchers with differing perspectives to test two theories in a collaborative, yet critical, environment aimed at reducing confirmation bias and accelerating scientific progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adversarial collaborations are a powerful social process, little used because of its challenging nature, within any field that has competing theories,” said Koch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The bio-medical field could hugely profit by ‘friendly’ competition among theories—neurobiological or others. But it requires a great deal of cooperation and work.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this consciousness and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6c000516420819091b0907092c0d0000090205021f18051819180942031e0b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Liz Dueweke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://alleninstitute.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Allen Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Liz Dueweke – Allen Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08888-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Adversarial testing of global neuronal workspace and integrated information theories of consciousness&lt;/a&gt;” by Christof Koch et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adversarial testing of global neuronal workspace and integrated information theories of consciousness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different theories explain how subjective experience arises from brain activity. These theories have independently accrued evidence, but have not been directly compared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we present an open science adversarial collaboration directly juxtaposing integrated information theory (IIT) and global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT) via a theory-neutral consortium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theory proponents and the consortium developed and preregistered the experimental design, divergent predictions, expected outcomes and interpretation thereof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human participants (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 256) viewed suprathreshold stimuli for variable durations while neural activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetoencephalography and intracranial electroencephalography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found information about conscious content in visual, ventrotemporal and inferior frontal cortex, with sustained responses in occipital and lateral temporal cortex reflecting stimulus duration, and content-specific synchronization between frontal and early visual areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results align with some predictions of IIT and GNWT, while substantially challenging key tenets of both theories. For IIT, a lack of sustained synchronization within the posterior cortex contradicts the claim that network connectivity specifies consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GNWT is challenged by the general lack of ignition at stimulus offset and limited representation of certain conscious dimensions in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These challenges extend to other theories of consciousness that share some of the predictions tested here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond challenging the theories, we present an alternative approach to advance cognitive neuroscience through principled, theory-driven, collaborative research and highlight the need for a quantitative framework for systematic theory testing and building.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1OM01ra3VKYktYYTlaamZsaUxKR3VSZnRGNUtHWGFjUjhhM0NuZzc0Z2hFcWwtSWNuZXE3LWlqQ29KZlR3NFpmS0pwNW1ucFFxcklJUGFwZFFOSDNhWWpyUDBWVTdGQnZCeUhSNEwwUmNsdWYyRnpuaA</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家说，这5种食物在没有人意识到的情况下会损害心脏- Surrey Live | Cardiologist says these 5 foods damage heart without people realising it - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQRXBLZ1NnY0JlWmpjaEVWZldBSzc2RTJqRHdqemNwcGxfWHhnR3oxRHZxN1JLVzBtQzNrMmI3UElxZzA1V0g5aHJtbUJaeXhYRDM1SVk4Mi1penhZSTExTkxRSC12ZjlFNi1JUEZoOUtoX25GTDVGSGVCYU1CckNsTWhIeTRIN3Rm?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nutrition expert has warned that people could be unknowingly eating food which could cause their heart damage. Cardiologist Magdalena Perelló said some common products in our diet can have a silent but harmful impact on the health of our hearts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He explained that the worrying thing is that these effects do not always manifest with obvious symptoms, which means they go unnoticed for years. Dr Perelló said: “The worrying thing is that these effects don’t always manifest with obvious symptoms , which means they go unnoticed for years. However, they accumulate over time, increasing the risk of hypertension, arteriosclerosis, heart attacks, and other heart diseases. For this reason, the specialist has revealed the five foods you should avoid or limit if you want to protect your heart in the long term.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;” The worrying thing is that many people believe they eat well simply because they don’t overeat or because they avoid obvious fats like fried foods. But there are everyday foods that, when consumed regularly, have a silent but very negative impact on the heart.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many people believe that they eat well simply because they do not overeat or because they avoid obvious fats, but there are everyday foods that, consumed regularly, have a silent but very negative impact on the heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; These are the five foods that, according to Perelló, you should avoid or reduce if you want to protect your cardiovascular health in the long term, &lt;a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/poultry-chicken-higher-mortality-risk-study/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;News Nation Now reported&lt;/a&gt; : &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Five foods that damage heart health&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Processed meats (cold cuts, sausages, bacon): Processed meats are a silent bomb for the heart. They usually contain large amounts of sodium, saturated fats and preservatives such as nitrites and nitrates, all of them associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases. In addition, recent studies link frequent consumption of this type of meat with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, which reinforces the need to limit their intake.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Sugary drinks (soft drinks, industrial juices): A can of soda can contain up to 10 tablespoons of sugar. This excess glucose not only quickly turns into abdominal fat—a key risk factor for heart diseases—but also promotes insulin resistance, chronic inflammation and increased triglycerides. The most deceptive thing is that many “natural” or “light” drinks also contain artificial sweeteners or hidden sugars.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Trans fats (industrial pastries, snacks, margarines): Artificial trans fats are probably one of the worst ingredients for heart health. They are generated during the industrial hydrogenation process and are found in biscuits, margarines, crisps, fast food and other ultra-processed foods. Trans fats not only raise LDL (bad) cholesterol, but they also reduce HDL (good) cholesterol and generate inflammation in the blood vessels. They are banned in some countries due to their toxicity, but they are still found in many products. Checking labels and avoiding ingredients like “partially hydrogenated oils” is key to reducing risk.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;White bread and refined flours: This type of food is digested very quickly, causing spikes in blood glucose that can damage arteries in the long term and contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes and heart diseases. Even though they don’t have fat, refined breads and flours can act as quick sugars in the body. The problem is that they are usually part of all meals: breakfast, lunch and dinner. Opting for wholemeal breads, whole grains, or legumes is a better alternative to maintain good cardiovascular health.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Excess salt: Sodium in large quantities promotes fluid retention and increases blood pressure, two factors that directly damage the walls of blood vessels and overload the heart. Most people do not realise it, but 70% of the sodium we consume does not come from the salt shaker, but from processed and precooked foods we eat daily. Therefore, checking labels, cooking at home and using natural spices are simple strategies to reduce salt intake.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Beneficial foods for the heart&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to scientific studies and recommendations from institutions such as the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/aha-diet-and-lifestyle-recommendations" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;, there are three foods that are especially good for the heart:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fatty fish (salmon, sardines, mackerel). Fatty fish are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which help reduce triglycerides, lower blood pressure and prevent clot formation. They also have anti-inflammatory properties, which protect the lining of the arteries.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Nuts (walnuts, almonds, pistachios). They are an excellent source of healthy fats, fibre, antioxidants and minerals like magnesium. Walnuts, in particular, contain alpha-linolenic acid (a type of plant-based omega-3) that helps reduce LDL cholesterol and improves vascular health.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Oats. Oats contain beta-glucans, a soluble fibre that helps reduce total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. It also helps keep blood sugar levels stable and provides satiety, which is useful for weight control.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 11:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQRXBLZ1NnY0JlWmpjaEVWZldBSzc2RTJqRHdqemNwcGxfWHhnR3oxRHZxN1JLVzBtQzNrMmI3UElxZzA1V0g5aHJtbUJaeXhYRDM1SVk4Mi1penhZSTExTkxRSC12ZjlFNi1JUEZoOUtoX25GTDVGSGVCYU1CckNsTWhIeTRIN3Rm</guid></item><item><title>一个常见的致命细菌正在危及美国人： “大流行在眼前” - AOL.com | A common killer bug is endangering Americans: ‘Pandemic in plain sight’ - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE9LZ2R4c2FJMmlUYnRINDR3UTRRaHdkbEFmdjVYV3pMdllzOHN4dnpsWllXaWpTZEFvbzJtZmVpeW9KUEtvNG12QkVqZEJzVlhKeUMxclYybmZQMUZuekc3bmpQX1FRd2h2dkxfc3RkQ1laaGUxVWF0bC1mbDZHVEk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years after the worldwide hyperfocus on COVID-19 began, some are concerned about the next pandemic — whether it could be caused by influenza, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/bird-flu" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:bird flu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; or another pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too easily overlooked are non-influenza, non-COVID viruses and bacteria that are burgeoning and spreading unchecked — both in the U.S. and around the world.

when it causes a clinical infection, Osowicki told Fox News Digital in an on-camera interview. &lt;strong&gt;(See the video at the top of this article.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the problem, he said, is that because the bacteria may be harbored, the diagnosis isn’t always found early enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS/mvaj7wvj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read On The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read On The Fox News App&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The Streptococcus Group A bacteria has been on the rise around the world, doctors warn.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scarlet fever and rheumatic fever/rheumatic &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; can result from recurrent or untreated strep — and they are on the increase again in areas without adequate medical care, including parts of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rheumatic heart disease is a chronic, non-infectious illness that occurs after untreated group-based streptococcal infections — and almost certainly after multiple untreated, group-based streptoococcus infections," Osowicki said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/strep-throat-infections-spiked-above-pre-covid-highs-report-weve-missed-cases" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Strep Throat Infections Have Spiked Above Pre-covid Highs, Says Report: 'We've Missed Cases';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Strep Throat Infections Have Spiked Above Pre-covid Highs, Says Report: 'We've Missed Cases'&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His research reveals that the prevalence of a life-threatening invasive version of strep Group A — which can include deep-rooted skin infections, sepsis, meningitis and deadly pneumonia — is on the rise around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aggressive skin infections, which are associated with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/drug-and-substance-abuse" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:intravenous drug use,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;intravenous drug use,&lt;/a&gt;

each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The important thing with group A strep, according to the doctor, is that antibiotic resistance isn't the primary issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Group A strep is reliably killed by penicillin — and has been since 1941 when penicillin was introduced," Osowicki noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Strep A colonizes the throat and tonsils of close to 20% of U.S. children, according to the researcher.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The point is that it actually does its damage in severe, life-threatening cases before the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:patient receives antibiotics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;patient receives antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;. There's this period where it is too hard to diagnose and treatment comes too late."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those cases, he said, the patients need ICUs, surgery and "the most intensive treatment we have to offer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among patients over the age of 65 or so, a quarter of them will die with this form of the disease, according to Osowicki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is not currently a vaccine for Group A strep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the more common form of strep throat and minor skin infections are "less scary," Osowicki warned of the dangers of overlooking the more invasive version of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/exposure-toxin-increases-colorectal-cancer-risk-younger-adults-study-finds" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Exposure To Toxin Increases Colorectal Cancer Risk Among Younger Adults, Study Finds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Exposure To Toxin Increases Colorectal Cancer Risk Among Younger Adults, Study Finds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We look away sometimes from the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:life-threatening infections;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;life-threatening infections&lt;/a&gt; that we struggle to prevent, diagnose and treat, (until) these become the front-page sepsis cases that you see in the newspaper many weeks of the year," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're headline-catching cases. They're the cases like Rory Staunton in New York, whose tragic death (in 2012 from sepsis) really triggered the state census mandates across the U.S."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;There are up to 10 different group-based strep vaccines in development, ranging from entirely pre-clinical vaccines that have never seen a person to vaccines that have been tested in phase 1 trials.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need for an effective vaccine is clear — both for invasive strep and the more common variety. Osowicki and others in his group are working hard on developing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The current thrust of my research is all vaccine-related," he shared. "We do what are called human challenge trials, where we deliberately infect &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy adult volunteers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy adult volunteers&lt;/a&gt; with group A strep, painting it on their tonsils. And we do that in a very careful way, in an inpatient environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also provide early antibiotic treatments and collect throat swabs, blood and saliva to study how the human-only pathogen works and to explore ways to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ultimate goal is that it becomes a really high-powered platform to establish the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/vaccines" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:efficacy of vaccines,";elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;efficacy of vaccines,"&lt;/a&gt; said Osowicki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many vaccine candidates in various stages of development, from the protein-adjuvant kind (like Shingrix or the Novavax COVID vaccine) to the MRNA platform and various other kinds, the researcher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're working with every vaccine company that has a group-based streptococcal vaccine candidate in development," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are up to 10 different group-based strep vaccines in development, ranging from entirely pre-clinical vaccines that have never seen a person to vaccines that have been tested in phase 1 trials, Osowicki noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he is concerned about vaccine skepticism, particularly after the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/coronavirus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:COVID pandemic,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;COVID pandemic,&lt;/a&gt; which can keep people from trusting the emerging science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the researcher is excited about the future of the strep A vaccine and others, though he expects it could take at least five to 10 years before a worthy candidate reaches doctors’ offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new vaccine will be geared toward adults with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/beauty-and-skin" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:skin infections,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;skin infections,&lt;/a&gt; as well as the many millions of children who are at risk of both mild and severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal, Osowicki said, is to "create a vaccine that the world wants, that the world accepts, that the world says is safe, and that will help our children."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://fox.benevity.org/community/fundraiser/33289" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:go.fox/MCRI;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;go.fox/MCRI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to donate or to learn more about MCRI’s important research.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/common-killer-bug-endangering-americans-pandemic-plain-sight" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A common killer bug is endangering Americans: ‘Pandemic in plain sight’;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;A common killer bug is endangering Americans: ‘Pandemic in plain sight’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 11:33:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9LZ2R4c2FJMmlUYnRINDR3UTRRaHdkbEFmdjVYV3pMdllzOHN4dnpsWllXaWpTZEFvbzJtZmVpeW9KUEtvNG12QkVqZEJzVlhKeUMxclYybmZQMUZuekc3bmpQX1FRd2h2dkxfc3RkQ1laaGUxVWF0bC1mbDZHVEk</guid></item><item><title>死是什么感觉？明尼苏达大学的虚拟现实体验提供了一些答案。- Star Tribune | What is it like to die?

&lt;p&gt;Recent research is revealing that the earliest stages of human development, even before birth, may hold the key to predicting &lt;strong&gt;life expectancy&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking study conducted by researchers from the &lt;strong&gt;University of Adelaide&lt;/strong&gt; suggests that the length of &lt;strong&gt;telomeres&lt;/strong&gt; at birth could be a significant marker of how long an individual may live — and how susceptible they might be to &lt;strong&gt;chronic diseases&lt;/strong&gt; as they age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Role of &lt;strong&gt;Telomeres&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Longevity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telomeres&lt;/strong&gt; are crucial components of &lt;strong&gt;chromosomes&lt;/strong&gt; that play a central role in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/scientists-reveal-newly-discovered-protein-could-be-the-secret-to-reversing-aging-%e2%8f%b3/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="73951" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cellular aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These &lt;strong&gt;DNA&lt;/strong&gt; structures protect the ends of chromosomes, and each time a cell divides, the telomeres shorten. Eventually, as telomeres become too short to protect chromosomes, the cell can no longer divide and dies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This process has long been linked to aging, and the length of telomeres at birth could be a critical factor in determining an individual’s &lt;strong&gt;lifespan&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/newsroom/news/list/2025/03/17/embryo-development-holds-key-to-healthy-lifestyles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Rebecca Robker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a leading researcher at the University of Adelaide, some babies are born with shorter telomeres than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shorter telomeres are observed in children of women with obesity or metabolic syndrome,” Robker explained. “As adults, these individuals are at increased risk of premature mortality from cardiovascular events, such as a heart attack or stroke, even when they are not obese themselves.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight how the biological clock begins ticking before birth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How &lt;strong&gt;Maternal Health&lt;/strong&gt; Impacts Telomere Length&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed a striking connection between the health of the &lt;strong&gt;mother&lt;/strong&gt; and the telomere length in her offspring. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Factors such as maternal &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/soda-daily-why-you-should-think-twice/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="76015" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;obesity&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;or metabolic syndrome, which are known to affect a mother’s health, appear to directly impact the telomere length of the &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/chicken-embryos-dinosaur-gene-switch/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="83638" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;developing embryo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This means that a woman’s health prior to and during &lt;strong&gt;conception&lt;/strong&gt; can have lasting effects on the future health of her child, influencing their risk for &lt;strong&gt;chronic conditions&lt;/strong&gt; well into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers discovered that maternal health and &lt;strong&gt;environmental conditions&lt;/strong&gt; during the early stages of conception play a critical role in determining telomere length. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The process is highly responsive to signals from the mother’s body,” said Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Yasmyn Winstanley&lt;/strong&gt;, co-lead author of the study. “Our findings show that maternal health and environmental conditions at the time of conception can have long-term consequences and can even influence the offspring’s susceptibility versus resilience to aging-associated diseases in later life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Mechanism of &lt;strong&gt;Telomere Resetting&lt;/strong&gt; in Embryos&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most fascinating findings of the study is how embryos can &lt;strong&gt;reset&lt;/strong&gt; the telomeres they inherit from their parents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Shortly after &lt;strong&gt;fertilization&lt;/strong&gt;, the embryo inherits telomeres from both the egg and sperm, which may already be shortened due to the age of the parents. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the embryo has a natural mechanism that extends these telomeres, essentially resetting the biological clock.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This reset process can be disrupted by &lt;strong&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/strong&gt;, which can shorten telomeres even further. The researchers found that &lt;strong&gt;mitochondrial health&lt;/strong&gt; plays a significant role in this process, as mitochondria are responsible for producing the energy needed for telomere extension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;By studying embryos in mice, the team discovered that when mitochondrial function was impaired, telomeres did not reset properly, leading to shorter telomeres at birth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Potential &lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic&lt;/strong&gt; Approaches to Influence Telomere Length&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the shortening of telomeres before birth can increase the risk of chronic diseases, the researchers also discovered promising &lt;strong&gt;therapeutic possibilities&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using existing &lt;strong&gt;medications&lt;/strong&gt;, like the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/scientists-finally-crack-60-year-mystery-behind-diabetes-wonder-drug-metformin/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="73996" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antidiabetic drug metformin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, it is possible to help reset and lengthen the telomeres in embryos, potentially improving their future health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Robker&lt;/strong&gt; emphasized that “There are therapeutic opportunities to optimize this biology, which is a key determinant of chronic disease risk.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This opens up a potential avenue for interventions that could mitigate the long-term effects of shortened telomeres, offering hope for improving the health of future generations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers are continuing their work in collaboration with &lt;strong&gt;Vitaleon Pharma&lt;/strong&gt;, focusing on developing treatments that can improve telomere length through pre-conception and early embryo development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These findings not only offer a new perspective on the origins of aging but could also revolutionize how we approach &lt;strong&gt;reproductive medicine&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;public health&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;If you ask the personal trainer Hilary Hoffman her top tip for gym-goers, it's simple: Stop working yourself to total exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoffman came to this realization while she was working a high-pressure job as a financial analyst in the mid-2010s, often having just &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/get-fit-5-minute-workouts-tips-trainer-wall-st-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;five minutes a day for exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She became fixated on designing an exercise regime that was intense without exhausting her or making it hard to keep up with her demanding career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out, the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tried-expensive-54d-workout-review-pros-cons-2024-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;ideal workout&lt;/a&gt; is similar to the perfect job: tough enough to spark growth and reward big ambitions, but supportive enough to overcome the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You've got to work hard, but if you're working hard at something that has no upward trajectory, that's not on you in terms of your ability to succeed — it's really on your environment," Hoffman, the founder of the fitness program SotoMethod, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/burn-fat-build-muscle-workouts-diet-personal-trainer-2024-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;make more gains&lt;/a&gt; by working out just hard enough that you feel the burn without burning out, Hoffman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm going to tell you to push through a challenge, push through a burn," she said. "If you feel pain or if you feel discomfort, those are your signs to stop. But you've got to determine what resistance looks like versus pain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways to tell if a hard workout is doing more harm than good — and how it should feel when you're doing it right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="59993e5f-36c1-4bfd-ac9d-fe740e65a96a" data-toc-id="59993e5f-36c1-4bfd-ac9d-fe740e65a96a"&gt;Red flags: total exhaustion and inconsistency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common gym mistake is thinking you need to be exhausted to get a good workout, but &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/if-not-sore-after-workout-was-it-still-good-doms-2020-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;fatigue and soreness&lt;/a&gt; don't necessarily mean you'll get results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="59993e5f-36c1-4bfd-ac9d-fe740e65a96a"&gt;Warning signs that you're &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/warning-signs-exercising-too-much-2021-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;overtraining&lt;/a&gt; or pushing too hard include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You feel pain or discomfort in your joints or areas that aren't supposed to be working, such as back pain during a core workout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You're completely drained after working out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You dread working out, are consistently tempted to skip a scheduled workout, or often consider cutting it short.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working out feels overwhelming; you struggle to maintain your exercise schedule over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most effective workout strategy is to find exercise you can do consistently over the long term so you can keep making progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If something isn't working, check in to make sure you're keeping good form, consider easing up on the intensity, or shorten the workout, Hoffman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The strongest thing you can do when you feel pain is to stop because you're just protecting your body so that you can come back tomorrow and do this again to build more strength," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

                                    &lt;p&gt;Carmen Aiken of Chicago made an appointment for an annual physical exam in July 2023, planning to get checked out and have blood work done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointment was at a family medicine practice run by University of Illinois Health. Aiken said the doctor recommended they undergo a Pap smear and testing for sexually transmitted infections. Aiken, who works for a nonprofit and uses the pronoun they, was also encouraged to get the HPV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’d tested positive for HPV in 2019 and eventually cleared the virus but hadn’t gotten the vaccine to prevent future infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sounds like a good idea,” Aiken, 37, recalled telling the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also needed some lab work — part of routine monitoring for one prescription. After being examined, Aiken said, they were directed to a different part of the office building to get blood drawn and receive the first dose of the vaccine before leaving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then came the bill for what Aiken thought would be a free yearly exam: $1,430.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The medical procedure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The services at Aiken’s appointment included a pelvic exam, a vaccination and blood work to check, among other things, glucose levels and liver function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A yearly physical typically includes a variety of services, many that insurers are &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.healthcare.gov/preventive-care-adults/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;required to cover&lt;/a&gt; under the federal Affordable Care Act, such as reviewing the patient’s health history, screening for high cholesterol and performing a Pap smear to check the cervix for signs of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updating immunizations is also a common and typically covered service that’s a part of checkups. The vaccine for HPV — the human papillomavirus — provides protection against an infection that can cause several types of cancer. &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/hpv/hcp/administration.html" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Federal health officials recommend&lt;/a&gt; being immunized for HPV at 11 or 12, though the vaccine also can be administered later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The final bill&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was $1,430.13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That broke down to $1,223.22 for lab services and pathology, plus $206.91 for “professional services,” which included a charge for a 40-minute “High Mdm” outpatient visit — indicating a high level of “medical decision-making” — as well as charges for immunization administration and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A hospital price tag for blood work&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The billing issue for Aiken is that not all services that might be provided as part of a yearly physical necessarily will be covered by insurers as preventive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone who needs blood work for a specific medical concern — as Aiken did, for medication monitoring — could be required to pay part of the bill. That’s true even if the blood work is performed during a checkup alongside preventive services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some health insurers pay for standard blood work as part of a preventive visit. But that’s not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aiken had purchased a health insurance plan on the federal marketplace and thought the visit would be covered at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the bill came for more than $1,400, Aiken thought, “How did this happen?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said they called their insurer, BlueCross BlueShield of Illinois, and then, after an initial inquiry went nowhere, filed an appeal for the $1,223.22 amount owed for lab services, thinking: “Surely, this is a misunderstanding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the insurer sided with UI Health’s position that the blood work wasn’t preventive. In a letter denying Aiken’s appeal, BlueCross BlueShield of Illinois said that “the labs were billed correctly as diagnostic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insurer decided that Aiken was on the hook for 50% of the cost of outpatient labs performed in a hospital setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Van de Walle, a spokesperson for BlueCross BlueShield of Illinois, wouldn’t discuss Aiken’s bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francesca Sacco, a UI Health spokesperson, said Aiken scheduled the appointment for “medication monitoring and to obtain a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Medication monitoring is not considered a wellness benefit under the Affordable Care Act,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sacco also said Aiken’s labs were sent for processing to University of Illinois Hospital, more than a mile from the family medicine practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That left Aiken owing more. Hospitals typically charge much more than doctors’ offices or independent commercial labs for the same tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distinction between a preventive visit and a diagnostic one is important for billing purposes: It dictates who’s on the hook for the bill. A preventive visit generally comes at no cost to patients. But a visit for an ongoing medical issue is usually classified as diagnostic, leaving the patient subject to copays and deductibles — or even charged for two separate appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients might not notice a difference in the exam room. Much of that nuance is determined by the medical provider and captured on the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s still confusion about such billing matters 15 years after the ACA’s preventive services protections took effect, according to Sabrina Corlette, a founder and co-director of Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an outrageous bill for what should have been routine care,” Corlette said. “People just don’t have this kind of money lying around.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The resolution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the insurer denied the billing appeal, Aiken “fell down a hole into despair about it for a while. And then someone really wise was, like, ‘You can pay it, and then just stop thinking about it.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that’s what Aiken did: “I put it on my credit card.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sacco said UI Health works with insurers to resolve cost-sharing disputes, “however, it is the insurance company’s sole discretion whether a service is fully covered or subject to cost-sharing. In this case, the insurer determined that cost-sharing would be applicable to a specific portion of the services provided to the patient. Based on this determination, the patient was billed accordingly by UI Health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience had a lasting impact on Aiken, who said that last year they walked out of an urgent-care visit after a doctor recommended a Pap smear — fearing that would result in another big bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The takeaway&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delaying or avoiding care can lead to worse outcomes, which is why lawmakers tried to ensure that patients generally would pay nothing for preventive services like immunizations under the ACA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yearly checkups are a key element of preventive care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, most adults who never got the HPV vaccine don’t know they’re still eligible, so it’s critical to inform them of their options, said Dr. Verda Hicks, a gynecologic oncologist in Kansas City, Missouri. The vaccine offers protection against nine types of HPV and against HPV-related cancers in men, so the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that boys get the shot, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Get vaccinated,” Hicks said, pointing out the difference it makes for HPV. “We just do not have the same tools for many other cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some insurance companies won’t cover the cost of the vaccine &lt;a class="Link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/21613-hpv-vaccine" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;for some older patients&lt;/a&gt; — and the same services might be subject to different cost-sharing rules depending on whether they are conducted for prevention versus diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, prices can vary depending on where you go for care and where the tests are performed. If you need a blood test, ask that your doctor send the requisition to a commercial, in-network lab. People might not realize that labs drawn at a clinic could be sent to a hospital for testing, opening them to higher costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been a push in Congress to eliminate this price variation through “site-neutral” payment policies under which, regardless of location, the price for routine care would be reimbursed at the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Site-neutral reforms could potentially have significantly reduced Carmen’s expenses,” said Christine Monahan, an assistant research professor at Georgetown’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potentially upending the current systemm a case before the Supreme Court could eliminate the requirement that insurers cover preventive services like vaccines and annual screenings at no cost to patients. If the justices — who &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-316.html" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;heard oral arguments on that on April 21&lt;/a&gt; — side with the plaintiffs, Corlette said, “Then, we all potentially lose access to free, high-value preventive care. And that would be a real shame.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/samantha-liss-kff-health-news" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Samantha Liss &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/lauren-sausser-kff-health-news" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lauren Sausser&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; are reporters for KFF Health News.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He has won more than a dozen national journalism awards and is a four-time Pulitzer finalist.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was the culmination of my career, the pinnacle of my research” over the last 38 years, DeCarli said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="link" href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/alzheimers-research/news/news-grant-for-dementia" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$53-million study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, paid in annual allotments, was approved during President Trump’s first term. But in Term Two, the administration has taken a chain saw to universities, federal jobs and federal funding for scientific research, which has prompted talk of a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00938-y" target="_blank"&gt;brain drain,&lt;/a&gt; with scientists looking for work in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The termination letter from NIH informed DeCarli that his study, with its “artificial and non-scientific categories,” was on the chopping block because it “no longer effectuates agency priorities.” The UC Davis study was &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/health/alzheimers-research-nih-funding" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;one of 14 such research projects&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notified in March that funding was being terminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 7 million U.S. residents aged 65 and older have Alzheimer’s, the nation’s seventh-leading cause of death. Given the cresting age wave, the number is expected to roughly double in the next 35 years. So it doesn’t make sense that a deeper understanding of a complex set of unremittingly cruel brain diseases that decimate the lives of victims, and their loved ones, is no longer a priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f3f20ee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/320x213!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2712282/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/568x379!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f60bf7b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/768x512!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7bd7a58/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/1024x683!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ee40ec6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/1200x800!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="Mannie Rezende, suffering from Alzheimer's, walks with Rose Shalom at home in 2023." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/09cd7e2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/320x213!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ed6c2d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/568x379!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/43646c1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/768x512!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07103e7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/1024x683!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07fba4b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07fba4b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe6%2Fc2%2F6b693e234991a998f32a5b412ea8%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-001.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;Mannie Rezende, who was suffering from Alzheimer’s, walks with his wife Rose Shalom in June 2023.

When I spoke to him on Wednesday, Paulsen had just watched a Senate hearing in which Appropriations Committee Chair &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/04/30/congress/collins-says-trumps-research-cuts-must-be-reversed-00318301" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Susan Collins (R-Maine), demanded that NIH cuts be restored.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/23bf3ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/320x213!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F38%2Fda9ab556422fb4fe958cbb2a84b6%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-016.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f84eea2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/568x379!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F38%2Fda9ab556422fb4fe958cbb2a84b6%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-016.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0c7b607/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/768x512!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F38%2Fda9ab556422fb4fe958cbb2a84b6%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-016.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e60759c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/1024x683!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F38%2Fda9ab556422fb4fe958cbb2a84b6%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-016.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d9a9c1c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/1200x800!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F38%2Fda9ab556422fb4fe958cbb2a84b6%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-016.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="Mannie Rezende, suffering from Alzheimer's, and wife Rose spend time with their dogs in 2023." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6ea5d27/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/320x213!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F38%2Fda9ab556422fb4fe958cbb2a84b6%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-016.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c9398a9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/568x379!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F38%2Fda9ab556422fb4fe958cbb2a84b6%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-016.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d78b12a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/768x512!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F38%2Fda9ab556422fb4fe958cbb2a84b6%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-016.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/adc6548/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/1024x683!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F38%2Fda9ab556422fb4fe958cbb2a84b6%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-016.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/54f57ed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F38%2Fda9ab556422fb4fe958cbb2a84b6%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-016.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/54f57ed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3840+0+0/resize/1200x800!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F38%2Fda9ab556422fb4fe958cbb2a84b6%2F1308228-me-0612-lopez-alzheimer-gem-gem-016.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;Mannie Rezende and wife Rose Shalom with their dogs Clara, foreground, and Teddy in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think there is broadly bipartisan support” for continued research into Alzheimer’s, Paulsen said. And the official word at Health and Human Services is that the administration remains committed to “&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/04/30/congress/collins-says-trumps-research-cuts-must-be-reversed-00318301" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;robust biomedical research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” and “maintaining our global leadership in science and technology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that claim doesn’t square with the dismissal earlier this year of 1,000 NIH employees, or with news accounts of a plan to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/16/trump-administration-mulls-sharp-funding-cuts-at-health-agencies-00294781" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;slash 30% of the Health and Human Services budget&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and 40% of the NIH budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to imagine somebody opposed to finding cures, and yet we have no explanation for why they’re proposing a 40% cut,” Paulsen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that funds are flowing out the door far slower than they have in many years, and we know that researchers are submitting high-quality research and getting ‘answer pending’ or getting rejected,” he added. “And we know that existing multi-year grants are being canceled or payment is being delayed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Rose Shalom of Sunland lost her husband, Mannie Rezende, who had slowly deteriorated from Alzheimer’s over several years. Shalom called the disruption of research egregious and immoral, and she said those who control the purse strings on research should “spend some time with someone with Alzheimer’s and their caregivers to understand the unique horror of this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I visited &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-17/mannie-and-rose-one-couples-journey-through-alzheimers-a-very-tricky-thief"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rose and Mannie&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 at their home and at &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.opica.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OPICA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the West L.A. adult day-care center where Mannie spent his days with a few dozen others on the same path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we are living longer, more and more people will be diagnosed with this disease,” Shalom said. “The emotional and financial toll on the patients and their caregivers is beyond description.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is, unfortunately, no cure on the immediate horizon. But DeCarli said there have been some encouraging advances, including medication that can help slow the progression of cognitive decline, and improved diagnostics that can lead to earlier intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is both a world leader and a collaborator in medical research, DeCarli said. The process is integrated, “with people working on different parts … of the same question, and true discovery sometimes comes from interacting” with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration seems to have a different agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;· Dismantling the U.S. role in solving medical mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/climate/national-climate-assessment-authors-dismissed.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;· Dismissing hundreds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of researchers studying the impact of global warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/scientists-fleeing-america-trump-cuts-funding-jobs-1235324006/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;· Driving scientists&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to look for work in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who knew there’d be so many backwater swamps, potholes and detours on the road to making America great again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;steve.lopez@latimes.com&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiywFBVV95cUxQSExFaHRWN3FTdlVZQ0FPVkZTd1dFQ3I4X09sMEQ3c2tGN2JGYWwxMFdyMmllRXVlMDRrNlYzYnFMeVBOTWJjeng4bTBqOGNWZS1qZW1oZ3ZQdV92eWRycmRzcmRYNU9Tb3hfSDJWOFZlTWhuQWVqVTA0RUZLaE90ek9DRDBBQXVIOHE4cWRxc2Y4dlFQQXJKTERVZll6OW95VVhudDBCaEpoUUJCS1hSTUIyWDBRY1JTWWdSOUFUWVlJamtUeG1iaGx6MA</guid></item><item><title>通过吃大多数人每天吃的1种食物可以增加痴呆症的风险- Surrey Live | Dementia risk can be increased by eating 1 type of food most people eat every day - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOeU1mN0t6RXVfYTRKQW16Y0FVRHhHLUwzQkp4QVA3WEdfaXVTdUtWQjFnemRvbXh6LWp6OXFyeW84ZjY4LTlmalB3Z1FpTFlMUnRLSjh5R2k3QzBHUjVWYm80ZUU3X0FuRUgzR1BaQ3A1d01Sd0VMbW12RjBBLWhHd3JXNkcxQTZoTV9j?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, growing research has raised concerns about the impact of ultra-processed foods on brain health - particularly their potential link to dementia. These highly engineered products, often packed with added sugars, artificial ingredients, and unhealthy fats, are designed for convenience and long shelf life but may come at a cost to cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Studies have begun to show that diets high in ultra-processed foods are associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline, memory loss, and even dementia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Rosa Sancho, Head of Research at &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/news/diet-high-in-ultra-processed-foods-linked-to-a-higher-risk-of-dementia/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Alzheimer’s Research UK&lt;/a&gt;, previously shared how processed foods can also be linked to dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They said: "We don’t know for sure why people who eat ultra-processed foods show an increased risk of dementia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The researchers suggest it could be because these diets involve lower levels of important nutrients like fibre, because they include too much sugar and sodium, or because they may lead to high blood pressure or inflammation, which can be bad for long-term brain health."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31556821" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 2022 Chinese study on the effects of UPFs showed that out of 72,083 people, 518 went on to develop a form of dementia, with 287 being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and 119 with vascular dementia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, it showed that those who consumed ultra-processed foods did have an increased risk of developing dementia, compared to those who did not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This same research suggested that if people were to replace their intake of ultra-processed foods with minimally processed food by as little as 10%, they could potentially reduce their risks of developing dementia by 19%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Rosa Sancho further explained: “We know that what is good for our heart health is also good for our brain health, so we encourage people to stay active, socially connected and involved in activities and hobbies that they enjoy. It is also important to maintain a healthy, balanced lifestyle."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Research has also revealed links between ultra-processed food and high risks of depression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Led by Dr Raaj Mehta of Harvard Medical School, alongside Massachusetts General Hospital, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10512104/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; focused on over 31,000 American women and the impact of eating a poor diet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team tracked middle-aged women who had no sign of depression from 2003 to 2017, assessing their diets every four years, and the results were shocking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the study, a diet rich in ultra-processed foods - such as bacon, sausages, and artificially sweetened drinks - has a high chance of increasing your chances of suffering from depression. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These foods typically contain five or more ingredients, often including additives and preservatives that aren't normally used when cooking at home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the study it was revealed that the women who indulged in a higher proportion of UPF had larger BMIs and were also more likely to smoke and far less likely to exercise regularly. Not only this, but they had an increased prevalence of diabetes and hypertension.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also found that those women who decreased their intake of the 'bad foods' by at least three daily servings had a decreased likelihood of developing depression, in comparison to those who continued to eat a UPF-rich diet, over the course of the four-year intervals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's unclear exactly what element of ultra-processed foods is linked to depression, but their findings suggest that artificial sweeteners may be what is affecting the brain’s chemistry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 09:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOeU1mN0t6RXVfYTRKQW16Y0FVRHhHLUwzQkp4QVA3WEdfaXVTdUtWQjFnemRvbXh6LWp6OXFyeW84ZjY4LTlmalB3Z1FpTFlMUnRLSjh5R2k3QzBHUjVWYm80ZUU3X0FuRUgzR1BaQ3A1d01Sd0VMbW12RjBBLWhHd3JXNkcxQTZoTV9j</guid></item><item><title>参观儿童博物馆后，帕萨迪纳居民百日咳检测呈阳性-洛杉矶时报 | Pasadena resident tests positive for whooping cough after visiting children’s museum - Los Angeles Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQOE5VbjctaklLUkwzQ3BzWnBmT0JmLUpBR3lKZGQ0RTRpdWsyenZPQUJhZWQzMlhpeTZtQlNKQWNPNjRzSXZIS1FwNkl0VlJJeS1xUDk3TVpRNmswNTBqLW0xbG1vbXRsdTVfMTQxZ05WZXVKeFBGNVNBOGxlMGpNV0RmbjI5VHpEZS1JZ3dJMGwxRXpGVFh2N09XSGJ3Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-body font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 text-primary-text-color clearfix mb-10 md:max-w-170 md:mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Pasadena resident has tested positive for whooping cough, a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-11-22/highly-contagious-whooping-cough-rises-in-california-to-highest-levels-in-years"&gt;highly contagious respiratory illness&lt;/a&gt; that can be lethal in infants, after visiting the Kidspace Children’s Museum last week, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pasadena Public Health Department announced the infection on Thursday as whooping cough cases &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;continue to rise&lt;/a&gt; across the United States. There have been more than 8,470 cases reported nationally  in 2025, which is about double the cases reported in the same time period last year, according to &lt;a class="link" href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/177663" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials warned anyone who visited Kidspace from 1:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. on April 25 to monitor their household, and especially children, for symptoms such as a runny nose, a low-grade fever and difficulty breathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone feeling ill after visiting the museum during this window is urged to visit their healthcare provider and avoid contact with babies and pregnant women. Infections can be confirmed with a nasal swab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-risk individuals, such as infants younger than 1 and pregnant women, may need preventive antibiotics even if they are not showing symptoms, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whooping cough is caused by a type of bacteria called Bordetella pertussis, which attack the upper respiratory system and can cause airways to swell, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms typically begin five days to three weeks after exposure with a mild cold and a fever of less than 100.4 degrees. In severe cases, symptoms will progress to coughing fits that cause gasping or whooping sounds and vomiting. Infants may not display the telltale whooping cough, but turn blue, red or gag due to difficulty breathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California whooping cough cases more than quadrupled last year — from 644 in 2023 to 2,753 in 2024, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Immunization/Pertussis_Report_DEC2024.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;state health department&lt;/a&gt;. In the past six months, two babies in Louisiana and a 5-year-old in Washington have died from the illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are vaccines for whooping cough. As early as 2 months old, babies get the first in a series of DTaP shots, which also protects against diphtheria and tetanus. The vaccine is administered again at 4 months, 6 months and then again at 15 to 18 months and when the child is between 4 and 6 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine series is part of school-entry immunization requirements in all 50 states, and a booster shot is recommended for pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts attribute the uptick in infections to decreasing vaccination rates. Last year, the share of children with exemptions to school-entry vaccinations across the country hit an all-time high of 3.3%, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s unfortunately been increasing anti-vaccine sentiment in the United States,” Dr. Ericka Hayes, who works at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told the Associated Press. “Our recovery is not nearly as quick as we expected it to be and we needed it to be. And again, when you fall below 95% for vaccinations, you lose that herd immunity protection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

This would allow greater control and magnification, for precise and meticulous surgery," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Tanya had a mastectomy in 2020 following a breast cancer diagnosis, but the pandemic and the backlog of other patients meant she had a long wait for reconstructive surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It was Mr Nikkhah who suggested the new procedure for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"When I heard that I would be the first patient in the UK to have this procedure I was a bit nervous but so excited and willing to be part of this," Tanya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"My family said 'you must be crazy!' but I couldn't imagine saying no."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She added: "The team promised to make me feel whole again, and that's what they did.

whistleblowing report revealed staff shortages and workplace relationships had compromised patient safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The review found there was distrust between managers and staff in maternity care, with just over a third of frontline workers saying they felt unable to report unethical behaviour without fear of reprisal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;NHS Lothian said it "fully recognises and apologises" for the poor experiences of some staff and said it had made several improvements in recent months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In December last year, BBC Scotland revealed that &lt;a target="_self"

were upheld or partially upheld in the whistleblowing report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It found major challenges with the working environment, including staff shortages that were leading to delays in women accessing treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The findings of a follow up report into the organisation's culture has been shared with NHS Lothian women's services staff in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It found that relationships with leaders were often strained, causing problems with general wellbeing, stress and even bullying or perceptions of unfair treatment and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In a presentation of the report's findings, staff were told that "some of the behaviours described in the report have no place in our or any other workplace, and we want to work with colleagues in women's services to ensure they are not part of our culture moving forward".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dFZIgd"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img

in women's services as "a calling".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He said: "We commissioned this independent research because we wanted to leave no stone unturned in our efforts to get a truly comprehensive picture of the experience of our teams in women's services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I apologise to those who have been let down at work and reassure them

services responded to a survey issued by the external reviewers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Half of respondents said their manager deals fairly with everyone but 36% of respondents said they felt unable to report unethical behaviour without fear of reprisals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A summary of the report's findings stated, "many staff report feeling close to burnout due to high workloads and inadequate staffing, leading to increased stress and sick leave".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It added that "concerns about bullying and a toxic work environment are prevalent". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;NHS Lothian said it has put in a rolling programme of improvements since concerns were first raised, including securing funding to employ almost 30 new midwives and other staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May
